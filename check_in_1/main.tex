\begin{abstract}
Social media is widely used across continents, generations, and social groups. Due to the accessibility and anonymity of social media, hate speech, an abusive or threatening statement showing prejudice and hate, has become a new social phenomenon and has gotten public attention. In previous research, there has been an effort to understand the behavior of such hateful speech using Natural Language Processing and Networks, and social media platforms have hate-speech detection models based on such research. Although research provides an effective method to detect hateful speech, research understanding its behavior still needs to be completed. This project aims to provide the framework for social media platforms to conduct an early intervention in hate speech using network behavior of content instead of relying on language models for classification.

\section{Activities}
    \subsection{Planned Activities}
      
    \hspace{5mm}In week 01, We planned to finish our literature review, and have a meeting to discuss everyone is in the same page and to specify the project.
    
    In week 02, we planned to extract data from Reddit, and worked on organizing it.
    \subsection{Accomplished Activities}
    \hspace{5mm}We finished our literature review, and discussed the direction of the project. Based on the discussion, we finished our project proposal as planned. We used Reddit API to get posts and comments from subReddit, and we are working on cleaning and understanding datasets.

    \vspace{2mm}
    \hspace{5mm}Above is the posts we called through Reddit API. We are planning on as many posts in different subReddits.

    \vspace{2mm}
    \hspace{5mm}Above is the example comments of the post written by user name 'ymv4hx' in r/AskReddit. Yet, we are working on the data cleaning process.
\section{Challenges}
    \subsection{Open Challenges and Questions}
    \hspace{5mm}There were so many subReddits, and it was challenging to choose which subReddits to choose, as we want to build an unbiased models.
    
    \subsection{Major Changes}
        \hspace{5mm}No major changes have been made in this week.
