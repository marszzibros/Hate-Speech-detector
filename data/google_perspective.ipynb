      "hey guys i want to first say that finding this sub was so helpful to me at a time when people wanted to make a demon out of me i find this place a refreshing reminder of my humanity here s my ordeal i spent years with a girl and over the course of that relationship we had an amazing time there were ups and downs of course and mistakes were made but a lovely relationship overall however it ran its course and we ended it after a short time apart ultimately we wanted our careers so that was that we were on friendly terms for about months swapping messages and snapchats but it all changed about months after we broke up her tone changed her friends have since spread rumours that i m a rapist and she has called me sexually abusive she cites elements of our sex life that i d believed were consensual and mutually enjoyed as having been abuse i even reviewed our entire text and fb message history and like i say everything we tried was mutual according to her however things that she said she wanted to keep trying and get better at have now been turned around against me i even found times i was saying we don t have to do this or that if you don t want to and her response being no i enjoy those things for the record this is nothing illegal or dark just the different things you try when you re in a long term relationship what i really wasn t ready for was the revisionism girls who i hooked up with years earlier decided to sympathize with her despite friendships with me in the intervening time and no mention ever of me being abusive or pushy it s been bizarre i was a sexually active guy in my young years but this accusation has warped people s opinions on me i m not perfect i ve absolutely fucked up in the past and reacted badly to stressful situations but this has taken all of my human qualities and just magnified them it s tough honestly anyone experienced anything remotely similar\n",

      "i had this idea based on my personal difficulty with finding proper representation in my child custody case problem statement we understand there is a lot of gender bias inherent in the family court system however what a lot of people might not realize is the bias is expressed in the form of attorneys as opposed to poorly written laws or bad judges example if a man and woman divorce the father really wants his kid s of the time and the mother basically wants full custody with marginal visitation let s assume time with the father the mother finds an attorney willing to argue for the father finds an attorney who basically says you just can t get let s try to fight for now whether the father s attorney wins or not the father still gets inequal parenting time but it s not because of a biased judge or law it s because the attorney was unwilling to fight for equality and chose an easier path instead suggested solution start a project that collects information about how attorneys are arguing cases with the intent of creating a database that shows which are friendly to fathers right such that a newly divorcing man can access and the to find suitable legal council possible methods of aquiring information self reporting from various men going through divorce custody battle via calling email campaign to various law offices to ask how they handle specific cases perhaps there is a method to gleam data from public records in some jurisdictions i don t believe this project would be very helpful in the early period it would take a large amount of time to gather and correlate that much information in a way that makes it helpful to the average joe what are the community s thoughts edit also does something like this already exist that anyone knows about i d be happy to provide them my data point\n",
