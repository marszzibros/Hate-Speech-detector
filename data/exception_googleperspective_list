2830,as the world goes through vast change and the structures of the past appear to be collapsing all around us the idea of socialism has re arisen in western democracies it seems today that when anybody speaks about the benefits of socialism they reference the nordic countries in how wonderful and progressive they are with utopian social welfare policies one only has to look briefly at the history of these places to see that the governments that have evolved in these countries did so over lengthy periods of time with highly homogeneous communities looking at america travelling from east to west then south and the middle the variations can be so great it is like living in different countries in the nordic countries they base social policies upon the populations seeing themselves as the one thing swedish finnish danish etc this type of unity doesn t exist in america the mixture of people from all lands on earth with different cultures religions philosophies has created the most amazing technological scientific literary film and musical innovation the world has ever seen but the americans don t see themselves as one people in such a new country there are still huge divisions in the populace as to what precisely the definition of an american is socialism has many variations but can narrow down to two main role models sources of origin in the european counties it is evolved socialism which uses the free market and has great social welfare programs and in other places such as venezuela and cuba where it is enforced socialism which draws its roots from marxist ideals the biggest difference between the two besides one being enforced and one naturally evolving is that the marxist version is based in an ideology of an oppressor e g the ruling elite rich land owners bourgeoisie etc did this to me so when they are gone my brothers sisters and i can be happy to lead a peaceful utopian way of life the european version doesn t have an oppressor type of foundation that has to be eradicated instead it is about focusing on what is best for the society so the question arises with this new wave of socialist politicians appearing in america and around the world what form of socialism do they believe in listening to the new socialists they will point to the benefits of socialism in nordic countries and how fantastic such programs will be once implemented in the united states but one merely has to follow their educational tree backward to know where these people picked up their brand of socialism from and in most instances it wasn t europe by following the history of these new wave of socialists it allows us to have a better understanding into what motives them if you want to look at socialism today you have to start by examining modern feminism which has had a lot of influence over the new socialist movement looking to its history there have been four waves of feminism defined as the following first wave feminism early th century to focusing on women s suffrage property rights and political candidacy second wave feminism s to s focusing on reducing disparities in sex family the workplace reproductive rights de facto inequalities and official legal inequalities third wave feminism s to s focusing on embracing individualism and diversity fourth wave feminism to present day focusing on combating sexual harassment assault and misogyny the metoo movement and removing the patriarchy this latest group are known as the kali s neo suffragettes or th wavers waves one and two almost entirely dissipated when they achieved most of their aims wave three was left shell shocked when the ussr collapsed leaving those that had allied the ideology to marxism academics protesters ineffective the fourth wave reawakened and radicalised quickly with the use of social media and movements such as metoo its agenda now is to remove the patriarchy the question then arises if the current wave of feminists want to remove the patriarchy then what actually is it a dictionary definition is a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it in both the animal and human worlds there are hierarchies in place we as humans are adaptive animals who have mastered living in environments across the earth in the last few thousand years humans have moved through extremely rapid and unparalleled transformation in population increase and how our communities live together and one of the components in allowing them to do that are highly adaptive hierarchical structures from the feminist perspective these hierarchies have been controlled by men and oppressed women to maintain control and power and while there is some accuracy in this if human history is examined closely one discovers that this is a biased representation territorial fighting underlies both human and animal existence in the majority of cases the groups that will dominate this fighting will be those led by males so the hierarchical structures that evolved did so around male leadership there are some examples of matriarchal hierarchies in both the animal and human world but they are fairly rare due to males being naturally superior in their fighting and hunting abilities and that women bearing children need to be protected and fed men s brains are hard wired to perform single focused tasks which makes them better hunters and fighters while women brains are wired more around communication multi tasking and co operative tasks which makes them better at raising children the society and government groups that developed did so through an evolutionary trial and error process for whatever worked best for that community at the time as the environments and populations changed so did the hierarchical structures that held them together examining the history of the women s movement and what motivated them into action starting with the suffragettes most of the men and women at that time lived very hard lives working or more hours a day in dangerous and menial jobs such as working in factories and coal mines alcoholism was endemic and men lived in shell shocked states from being used as cannon fodder in wars the average working class jobs involved brutally hard work for little pay and no labour or safety regulations which many today would call a form of indentured slavery it was common for woman to have eight or more children life expectancy was low for everyone and mother and infant mortality rates were high in of men and of women could vote so both men and women had it very tough with such repression it was both the labour and suffragette movements that made huge strides in raising the quality of the average person life often through violent confrontations as more women were freed from having to be mothers at home many went on to study in universities and were able to freely document their experiences examining the history of many of the original feminists academics one notices that many were sexually molested or suffered through some other violent abuse at some stage of their lives andrea dworkin who wrote women hating was molested at the age of nine and severely abused by her first husband shulamith firestone who wrote the dialectic of sex the case for feminist revolution had severe mental illness in the form of schizophrenia valerie solanas who was considered one of the most radical feminists ever writing the famous work scum manifesto rose up to fame after shooting the famous artist andy warhol her father molested her as a child and she ended up being committed to a psychiatric hospital after being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia many of the other early feminists were first generation children from holocaust survivors with epigenetic traits inherited through the genes trauma from their parents many feminists fathers had ptsd after returning from service or prison camps in world war and continued the cycle of violence upon their children ptsd inducing incidents cause the sufferers brains to become hard wired to permanently hate and fear certain groups or types of people and because the neurons become hard wired there is little they can do to alter this long enduring fearful revulsion this type of reaction is also common to many war veterans after returning from combat when someone has ptsd their perspective of the world is often very fixed to an alerted amygdala flight or fight response one has to ask how much of the opinions and all the initial feminist doctrines and ideology relating to male patriarchal power oppression gender studies and related issues were written by women suffering ptsd or similar related conditions there is no objective view possible if it is tainted through the lens of a fear and hatred from past traumatic events in which the pain continues to be replayed thousands of times through self revised traumatic repetitions of the original episodes this would be highlighted even further when it is echoed within groups who have all had a comparable experience thus reaffirming and strengthening the belief collectively of what the original source of their trauma was people who have lost their power through a traumatic episode want someone to blame for the pain suffering and disconnect they now feel and will often fight for an alternative source of power to fill the vacuum of helplessness they feel old world war and vietnam veterans will often talk about hatred they still have for the japs krauts and charlie even though many decades have passed since those wars had finished many will drink engage in dangerous behaviours and self medicate with various substances to temporarily fill the void the psychological damage these early feminists had is no different to the ones the veterans face except who they identified as the enemy in the feminist case it was men as a group who became known in feminist lore as the patriarchy so while there are hierarchies in the world and many of them are run by men the concept of one great underlying oppressive group that subjugates and oppresses society and government is a paranoid and irrational view of someone absorbed in psychiatric distress who is seeking for strategies to protect themselves and explain the origins of their perpetual despair and torment if a world war two veteran suffering from ptsd were to tell you that all german people are all evil you could explain to them that it would be impossible for all members of a specific society to be that way and how the populous had been indoctrinated to evil ideologies by dark prophets this rational explanation though would not be enough because those damaged by trauma become deaf to logical reasoning surrounding it many of those feminists who were suffering from deep trauma authored the original books and papers that became the bedrock of the feminist movement since then the mythology has endured and developed into a huge unverifiable here say pseudo science that has corrupted and held back studies within disciplines such as sociology over half a century now if individuals are lost in an ideology providing evidence contrary to their core belief threatens the ideology s existence so research bias the process where the scientists performing the research influence the results in order to portray a certain outcome has become endemic to these feminist dominated sciences the core of many feminist sociology departments research has been based around the erroneous assumptions that patriarchal hierarchies and systemic oppression are the main source of most of the problems and dysfunction within our culture while in truth it is really trauma that it is the foundational source of it by collecting the statistical data from an average town calculating that only a small percentage of the men in this population need to be violent or have predatory tendencies for a large part of the women s population to suffer at some point in their life some kind of traumatic episode so even though there are men that do horrible things to women they only make up a small percentage of the total population of men those female victims of assault and trauma develop an unconscious bias where they begin to see most if not all men in that population as bad fearful or evil this is why when the concept of the patriarchy is mentioned many women resonate with it because it seems to provide a very plausible explanation behind what has happened to them and other women over a slow process feminists views intertwined themselves with marxists ones creating a new hyper normalisation where those lost within the ideology can no longer see the difference between the two so if you want to be a feminist fighting for women and other minorities rights you have to believe their marxist ideology around an oppressor which it turns out is the patriarchy traditional feminine traits such as gentleness empathy sensitivity caring sweetness compassion tolerance nurturing are not valued anymore as women can t be seen to be weak or vulnerable once indoctrinated into the cult like ideology you can not rest or be at peace until the patriarchy has been eliminated so your mind and actions become swayed like an automaton with an individual objective that justifies any unsavoury actions you may have to take in the process a t from the terminator films would be the closest analogy in our contemporary mythology in that you can t plead debate or negotiate with it and it will destroy all that stand in its path to achieve what someone has programmed it to do this is even further muddled by movements such as climate change protesters environmentalists vegans animal rights all blending into the th wave and then all vying for influence and power within the movement with all of them now believing the patriarchy plays a great part in who is to blame in all their separate battles around the world many white straight women gay men and jews are being removed from positions of power or are being dumped and replaced by trans black lives matter and other minorities it is no secret that in professors in many modern american universities are openly marxist and a high proportion of the rest of them have extreme left wing views particularly in the humanities in a country that doesn t have a peasant underclass to manipulate into a revolution this has led to most of these educators treading water for decades with the radicalised victim culture that social media has created in the last decade it has now developed into a feasible task to mobilise those who see themselves as victims and as they are educated to believe victims of of an evil patriarchy the many women lesbian gay men transgender and other minority groups who it has been statically shown to have suffered a higher rate of traumatic incidents in their lives than the general populace are searching for someone or something to attribute that on they ask why am i in so much pain why is all of society stacked against me what is the source of all this misery in my life how do i heal from the hurt of my past and live in freedom when they ask these type of questions along come the gender studies and marxist professors to point out that it is the patriarchy that has done this to you so instead of helping individuals in trauma and empowering women men and minority groups they are instead recruiting them to an army of suffering in a never ending ideological battle with the promise that their current pain will only end when the fight against the patriarchy is over this is very similar to george orwell s book where the masses were fighting never ending wars against other enemies and the inner party through an act of doublethink believes that such a victory was possible the professors isolate these new pupils from foreign views indoctrinating them into their new family s values as they are the only ones who care or know of the anguish their members have been through universities which were once dynamic training grounds to educate the new leaders of the future have sections portioned off as safe spaces to isolate and indoctrinate its members to the th wave ideals like the ruling elite or bourgeoisie within marxist ideology it is easy to distort the patriarchy definition and then anyone striving for power can make the term refer to anyone who challenges them thus creating tyrannical rule simply look at the present insanity on social media and main steam media to see how this is taking place right now blacks whites latinos asians native americans indians gays trans and both men and women are being called out for their privilege and their alliance to the patriarchy because their viewpoints disagree with a th wave narrative several ex kgb defectors spoke of a process known as ideological subversion which was practised by ussr against the us and still continues to be used by russia today the intention behind ideological subversion is that marxist ideas are implanted within the general populace starting in newspapers and media as well as of centres of higher learning as time passes these concepts become accepted and adopted across society as those who have been indoctrinated in universities graduate they circulate through the workforce taking on many jobs such as educators teaching children at schools positions throughout the public service and government in law making and management journalism and so on so every facet of society ends up being tainted by a subverted ideological agenda although the russians did this for many decades with some success it wasn t till the combination of the internet iphone smart phones and social media appeared that this subversion went into hyper drive spreading these ideas in seconds as opposed to decades the seeds originally sowed by the marxists in the universities and throughout society over many decades blossomed what started off in social and alternative media has now graduated to mainstream media with many male and female reporters holding th wave feminists viewpoints unknowing they carry the seeds of marxism within them as the revenue for newspapers television and other forms of mainstream media collapse instead of using trained journalists news makers are now turning to cheap churnalism opinion pieces instead with rage bait headlines to get more views many of which carry a huge th wave bias no matter what your occupation is be it politician public servant charity organiser ceo entrepreneur journalist teacher waiter toll booth attendant etc if you don t now represent and push the modern th wave female narrative you are criticised as the enemy of women and are labelled a misogynist privileged a mansplainer sexually hostile a femaphobe anti feminist uncompassionate a gas lighter alt right an extremist toxic male or simply an angry man woman and then publicly outed and shamed gender studies graduates who were once unemployable are now holding leading positions as consultants and in human resource positions in the largest tech corporations worldwide educating major players such as google facebook yahoo instagram youtube twitter and apple as to what is appropriate behaviour these th wave beliefs then get placed within the companies standard operating policies and practices and influence how they run their businesses individuals with an anti th wave bias have their accounts cancelled from these modern platforms at a much higher rate than any other group and in the process lose their right to freedom of speech in social media so individuals are not given a trial through common law in this new world but are instead tried and convicted by the standard operating procedures of these huge corporations instead huge conglomerates such as procter amp gamble owners of the gillette company amp nike virtue signal with their th wave narratives in their advertising while overlooking their abysmal workplace practices many major corporations are now terrified of the social media backlash they will suffer if not perceived to be th wave friendly and will remove their advertising or sponsorship from anyone who dares to criticise or tries and communicate a different narrative eco protest groups climate change groups vegans animal rights groups and an extensive array of assorted minority protesters seeing how influential the th wave shame and blame techniques are have adopted then modified them to their own movements peta the animal rights group provides a prime example of this th wave speak adapted to their cause here in this passage taken directly off their website as feminists we re working to put more women in office and in corner offices we fight for equal pay tax free feminine hygiene products an end to sexual harassment funding for women s sports and streets safe enough for us to walk alone we push for strong role models who don t objectify women on television and in movies we work to end sex trafficking slavery genital mutilation and honour killings we rail against sexism in all its many forms except perhaps when it comes to what s on our plates can food really be sexist yes when it s the product of imprisonment rape reproductive control kidnapping and abuse the twisting and curtailing of free speech to a th wave agenda has now become common in both government policy commercial organisations and in protest groups tim cook provided an example of this when he recently addressed a media crowd on what apple will and won t tolerate being disseminated through their entire network so you have a huge multinational company with its own agendas dictating what free speech is now peta again demonstrated this when they tweeted the following words matter and as our understanding of social justice evolves our language evolves along with it here s how to remove speciesism from your daily conversations the animal rights organisation then included chart with what they view as offensive phrases on the left and what they view as acceptable substitutions on the right instead of kill two birds with one stone say feed two birds with one scone instead of be the guinea pig say be the test tube instead of beat a dead horse say feed a fed horse instead of bring home the bacon say bring home the bagels instead of take the bull by the horns say take the flower by the thorns in a later tweet peta compared the use of the original phrases to racist and homophobic language writing just as it became unacceptable to use racist homophobic or ableist language phrases that trivialise cruelty to animals will vanish as more people begin to appreciate animals for who they are and start bringing home the bagels instead of the bacon a quick google search with the words patriarchy and vegan climate change animal rights activism ngo or advocacy etc will highlight the armies of protester groups that erroneously believe that the patriarchy is the source of their organisations dilemmas and only its removal will solve that the metoo movement while having a noble intention at the beginning has now twisted into the th waves lynching tool to annihilate those who don t conform to their agenda like middle eastern terror groups it has no centre of control and anyone with access to a computer or phone can be part of the revolution and bring down whom ever they choose the film and entertainment industry are now terrified to produce anything that doesn t promote some type of social justice message the new archetype for women in the movies is one where she has to be an empowering role model talks tough handles a weapon she is a martial arts professional kicks ass better than the guys even if it s playing maid marion the worlds biggest steaming service netflix vigorously promotes their th wave agenda and removes narratives that would disagree with that so we now have a flood of new programs such as sabrina the social justice witch and orange is the new black a series originally based on piper kerman s memoir of her life in prison that has subverted itself into a peculiar form of th wave fan fiction attributing the keystone cop guards and patriarchy for all the women inmates problems award shows highlight female accomplishment and then actresses belittle and protest when award nominations do not have enough women or minorities in them the actress roseanne barr lost her own television series after one misrepresented tweet kevin hart was removed from hosting this years oscars because he refused to apologise for some tweets which he had posted years prior while female comedians such as hannah gadsby receive standing ovations and rave media reviews for their i hate men message even a movie called suffragette which detailed the struggles of suffragettes had its actresses shamed for having t shirts with the slogan i d rather be a rebel than a slave to promote the movie as according to the tsunami of hatred on social media four privileged white women wouldn t be able to understand what slavery or oppression was martina navratilova the legendary female tennis player was recently called out as being transphobic when she said that people who were born male should not be allowed to compete in women s sports events as it was unfair the th wave sociology science says there are no difference between the genders so it makes no difference people now are waiting for mike tyson to go through a gender transition so he can take up women s boxing and compete on a no difference playing field as the th wave take over the various sciences they begin to twist the narrative of them to their own agenda often using pseudo science or fake research in the process in a group of academics exposed the corruption in grievance studies these people wrote the most absurdly ridiculous hoax studies and got of them accepted into highly respected academic journals with one receiving an award even though one was a re written passage from mein kampf in a slow trickle almost every type of study in universities and the workforce are being taken over by those with the th wave agenda warping all their narratives in the process schools are now having th wave narratives forced upon the pupils inducting a new generation to the ideology as students learn how gender doesn t exist and how toxic masculinity is the source of all societies ills when academics or old school feminists such as germaine greer try to speak out against the problems within the present movement it labels them bigots racists and nazis and they have their events cancelled because of violent protesting against them to be seen as a persecuted victim to a violent oppressor has now developed into the leading trading currency on social media as the recently staged jussie smollett attack shows if you believe you are a victim all the algorithms built within the social media platforms will reinforce that back to you to keep you permanently on their platform like an addicted slot machine player the individual absorbed in the victim mentality only feels pleasure when they win a prize in their case it is not money but attention or pity they receive instead the victim mentality takes power away from someone so they seek to obtain that power back by tearing others down and feel like they have won the jackpot when they do so but it is a hollow victory that demands another hit not long after so we have the new wave of algorithmically brain washed social media junkies that are perpetually anaesthetised into unconscious echo chambers of victim hood living only to receive their next hit with the average person under thirty using social media on their phone seven to eight hours a day many are using it much more this has generated a disastrous epidemic with each user now as seduced by their phone as gollum was with the ring of power it is no surprise the creators of these systems won t allow their own children to use them as victim culture has developed in the last decade socialism has now evolved into a mainstream viable choice for the millennial generation if you listen to the interviews from the new wave of far left politicians who are working to soothe and heal like a salve the pain of the past with their caring new type of leadership and revolutionary green political programs in the end politics is a numbers game just as donald trump exploited the right aided by genius rage baiter roger stone these people take similar actions within the left under the guise of benevolence and battling for minorities women s rights new left wing groups have appeared that recruit their leaders as you would a reality tv show celebrities these fresh recruits are being singled out based on being youthful instagram facebook friendly and from a particular ethnic group but these modern political candidates are just puppets who have been promoted to a position so they may carry out their creators agenda what is that agenda to fragment and create holes within the democratic party and then fill all the gaps until they hold majority power many of the leading players behind bernie sanders last election bid have been poached by those with even darker agendas than the th wave s when compared to these radical th wave politicians bernie sanders comes out looking like a moderate if there is long term strategy behind this who knows but it was bernie who was holding their hand promoting and encouraging them throughout their campaigns up to when they entered office this may evolve into an even scarier scenario when you realise how government organisations such as the nsa now can monitor all our calls and internet traffic our smart phones store our lives including every location we have travelled who we have spoken to and all our messages through recent decades we have been using it with social media platforms such as facebook or google through their extensive data collection pools they now can map our psychological profiles our iq sexual political and religious preferences books we have purchased the people we associate with and the clubs and organisations we belong to every email and text we have ever sent and received every website we have visited and every search we have carried out on a search engine the amount and breadth of data now collected would leave an old school russian kgb agent breathless not even at the peak of the soviet union was such a multitude of data collection feasible this data has been used by the us to gain military intelligence and financial advantage around the world but now imagine a government that was not interested in the military foreign intelligence or financial gain and instead was controlled by those who only believe in a th wave agenda then there would be a forced surrender of that data from these government entities and huge corporations to wield against its citizens this would consist of the vicious blame and shame social media insanity we currently see now made manifest in the form of a ruling government it would remove everyone that didn t conform with its narrative as a dissident you either accept what the th wave says or you are the enemy of the state there is no middle ground because like all those lost within a cult like ideology they believe they are serving the highest purpose the modern socialism this recent wave of leftist politicians wish to introduce has nothing to do with european socialism even the heads of many european countries have told bernie sanders to stop labelling their countries as a socialist for his own agenda but like the kgb defectors said you can show them the gulags and the people starving but the only thing that will change the minds of those lost within the marxist ideology is when an army boot comes crashing down on their head then and only then do they finally realise what has transpired whenever the ussr took over a country in the past they always placed the individuals who supported the revolution in re education camps gulags or simply shot them in the back of the head because they were the first to revolt and become dissidents when things didn t turn out even remotely like they had envisioned like the nordic countries australia and new zealand have fairly progressive social welfare policies and are very multicultural but again both of these evolved over long periods of time they were never thrust upon them in one tremendous surge of change coming from australia i know that currently just under of our populations is on some form of welfare in the form of old age pensions disability unemployment benefits etc many individuals within the country are now coming out to question this once called welfare safety net which seems to have transformed into a welfare hammock we have a universal health care system which is good but with the combined welfare and health systems are now costing around of government total expenditure with a population of around million that is ageing rapidly and living much longer this system is only just working but as most of our trade is with asia the next time that region has an economic equalisation we will suffer horrendously and will struggle to preserve this welfare state without producing massive debt then australia similar to the nordic countries will be just as susceptible to far left marxist ideals as the us is many countries in europe with the present economic and political uncertainty including the nordic ones are becoming more vulnerable to marxist ideals with their own constantly growing left wing parties who shelter under the cloak of th wave feminist movement the nordic and other countries are no less immune to this risk than anybody else even though they are labelled as model nations by the th wavers in many respects america is an oligarchy now with an enormous inequality in its distribution of wealth as many individuals seek to fill an empty void with power and wealth america also has an extreme right who are trapped in their own prejudices which they make no effort to hide and like feminism have their roots in trauma but if america were ever to become a socialist nation headed by an ideology of an oppressor there is a great possibility it could start a civil war that could lead to the downfall of democracy for the us and its allies around the world i imagine now that anybody who doesn t agree with what i have just spoken will be jumping up and down saying what about trump and the hysteria he brought to the white house but if you look at trump what you call his shadow side it is utterly out there in the open and that is the reason many people flock to him and his ideas he worships wealth discredits and chastises those who cross him hates criticism revels in being the biggest man in the room loves to win at all costs will distort the truth to prevail loves being applauded and cheered by a crowd is narcissistic lives to make a deal loves beautiful women and grabbing the pussy so there are no great hidden mysteries in trump s psychological make up but if you look to the new left their shadow is obscured by a smiling veneer of compassion and desire for equal rights but removing that you will recognise a victim identity the victim identity is the most treacherous and vicious one of all because it grants those entrapped within it to take violent actions under the justification they are always serving the highest motive it is a form of martyrdom the victim identity fighting against a perceived oppressor is what allowed the horrors of the holocaust to take place as the germans fought to wipe out their perceived oppressor the jews under marxism hundreds of millions were tortured and died leaving those left behind to live in stasi police states all in the name of eliminating their bourgeoisie oppressors the trauma victim mentality is exceptionally well summed up by the french philosopher jean paul sartre quote hell is other people a better translation might be hell is the others an exceedingly dangerous idea because it sets up the assumption that once you eliminate the others the hell won t be there any more and it was jean paul sartre and his students ideas that provided the template for pol pot s torturing and murdering of millions in cambodia in the name of creating a fresh perfect society the evil part of being inducted to an ideology is that the only way an individual recruited to it will receive respite from their suffering is once the believed perpetrator is eliminated but this is the lie used to manipulate the indoctrinated into committing atrocious acts against humanity in the name of trying to achieve a carrot on the stick goal a voice and equal rights for women should be the premiere goal of our societies but if it is attained through tyranny a tidal wave of rage will be the only outcome as hate begets hate blaming all the worlds problems on an imaginary oppressor has tainted everything from children education systems our media social service systems workplaces and government and has helped to lay the foundation for the ultra polarisation on both sides of the political spectrum the women s movement has been built on the modern freedom of western democracies and the industrial economic scientific revolutions of the last few hundred years if our societies were to go into a major decline then so would these freedoms and much of the progress made over this time go then we could see the rise of a dystopia so horrific that in comparison it would make the handmaids tale look like a disney adventure if i was to take all the above and sum it up in one sentence i d say if you want some form of socialism even if it is democratic socialism makes sure it doesn t come with an attached ideology of an oppressor because if it does it has nothing to do with a nordic or any other country s government and progressive social policies then there is a great possibility it could be the end for your country s democracy and freedom people always ask how good german russian chinese or cambodian people could carry out some of the most atrocious acts against humanity the world has ever known well here we go again p s there is a linchpin to all this madness polarity we have on both the radical left and right in the media politics etc and it will only come into play if we focus on the healing of the trauma both ours and our forefathers which has run through our societies for thousands of years and is the fundamental factor in humanities disconnect from themselves others nature and life people are only triggered if they have trauma in them to begin with to trigger when the trauma is gone so is the capacity to be triggered people only get lost in ideologies if they have a disconnect from themselves there is an old african proverb you can outrun what is running after you but not what is running inside of you peace will only ever be achieved if we are brave enough to end the war in ourselves first and let it flow out into the world wanting to reform the world without discovering one s true self is like trying to cover the world with leather to avoid the pain of walking on stones and thorns it is much simpler to wear shoes ramana maharshi
3441,this is the speech the cambridge feminists did not want anyone to hear its elizabeth hobson s speech from the justice men amp boys event yesterday published with her permission hello and welcome to the history of feminism i want to make two disclosures before i begin firstly that this lecture will concentrate on the western world particularly the anglosphere i am not suggesting that that s where feminism s boundaries reside or denying its existence elsewhere but it does start here and here is where my real expertise lie and secondly this may come as a surprise to you but i am not a feminist i am an ex feminist but after studying the movement i struggle to see how any reasonable person could know what i now know and be anything other than opposed to it i d like to thank the powers that be at cambridge university for refusing to bow to pressure from the mob and allowing these talks to go ahead and i d like to condemn the emotional reasoning of those who would have stopped them the purpose of further education is not to make people feel comfortable it s to challenge preconceived ideas and to build the capacity to meet challenging concepts head on and to grow from those experiences universities should be arenas wherein students build resilience tolerance and dignity but increasingly activists are subverting these spaces to feed anxiety black and white thinking and hysteria within their communities which is harmful to the search for truth that they should be engaged in and harmful to the individuals that they claim to want to protect including themselves so finally thank you to everyone sitting here now to those who ve come in support of our work those here out of curiosity and especially to anyone who s expecting to be offended yet intending to engage because that shows some strength of character before i get stuck into the recorded history of feminism i need to take a moment to illuminate the biological roots of the movement human beings are a gynocentric species this means that we prioritize the needs and well being of women over men this is an evolved instinct that came about as a result of women being the limiting factor in reproduction ie women have a much lower ceiling on how many offspring they can physically produce and in small communities that are subsisting this makes them highly important because they potentially hold the key to whether or not the collective will survive at all this is why we traditionally send only men to war this is why we have the women and children first birkenhead drill this is why people are more likely to put themselves at risk to save a woman in danger than a man and it s why we have feminism feminism has taken our gynocentrism and weaponized it men s role in this evolutionary sense is to act as a genetic filter both to mitigate gene replication errors ie preventing less successful combinations multiplying by barring many men from reproducing and to produce and retain genetic recombinations that enhance the fitness of offspring to these ends male fitness is constantly policed to ensure that women s standards are met before they gain sexual access which is why far fewer men than women reproduce because the pay off of carrying particularly successful genes is so much greater for men women will likely have the opportunity to reproduce if their fitness is moderate men may well not evolution gambles with male genes this results in very different bell curves for men and women in terms of iq and physical and psychological health with men being over represented at either end of the distribution particularly intelligent healthy or unintelligent unhealthy and women clustering around the middle feminists focus on the apex of male achievement to prove that men enjoy greater success than women whilst ignoring the biological reasons that catapult a minority of men to the stratosphere and on the acts of the most malevolent minority of men to generalize their patterns of behavior as emblematic of masculinity whilst ignoring the fact that the very demographics that preoccupy them show that what is emblematic of masculinity is actually variability so human beings have always valued women more than men and been more critical of men than women these were necessary instincts in tribal communities but they have been manipulated to privilege women to the point of dysfunction and this began with the development of proto feminism which arose in the late middle ages queen consort of france and england eleanor of acquitaine spearheaded a movement within her court to subvert the chivalric code which had traditionally governed relations between knights and lords and the general public to regulate the behavior of men towards women these women initiated a system of romantic feudalism wherein noble men were under irresistible pressure to identify a lady as midons my lord and to submit to her will and delicately accept any scorn that his midons saw fit to extend to him eleanor established courts of love in which she and her noble women would administer justice in romantic disputes not only may many men in particular recognize this state of gender relations but the modus operandi that eleanor and co used to achieve their supremacy is entirely familiar they generalised about all men based on the poor behaviour of a minority asserting that women needed protection from men s violations and they pushed forward a narrative of women s moral superiority justifying female dictatorship within years eleanors ideas had spread and saturated throughout europe and throughout the class system la f minisme proper was born in the revolutionary france of the late eighteenth century the political force first the term around half a century later in olympe de gouges published the declaration of the rights of woman and the female citizen in response to the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen by publishing this document de gouges hoped to expose the limitations of the french revolution in the recognition of women s rights and to initiate changes in the declaration of the rights of man to include sex equality de gouges opened her declaration with the quote man are you capable of being fair a woman is asking at least you will allow her that right tell me what gave you the sovereign right to oppress my sex close quote in the preamble de gouges mirrors the declaration of the rights of man explaining that women just as men are guaranteed natural inalienable sacred rights and that political institutions are instituted with the purpose of protecting these natural rights she closes the preamble by declaring that the sex that is superior in beauty as it is in courage during the pains of childbirth recognizes and declares in the presence and under the auspices of the supreme being the following rights of woman and the female citizen close quote she was one of a small number of women beheaded for treason during the revolution charles fourier is credited with having originated the word f minisme in a founder of utopian socialism and a slightly later supporter of women s rights he believed that all jobs should be open on the basis of skill and aptitude rather than sex segregated and that traditional marriage could potentially hurt woman s rights as human beings he himself never married fourier is believed to have influenced karl marx who argued as early as in his economic and philosophical manuscripts that women s position in society could be used as a measure of the development of society as a whole in the communist manifesto marx and friedrich engels celebrated the dissolution of the bourgeois family with an erosion of the status of the father already taking effect as women entered the workforce this they believed would lead to a higher form of the family in which women would be the true equals of men several years ago at a filia debate i heard sheila rowbotham explain that nobody could understand feminism without reading this book international women s day itself has bolshevik roots clara the grandmother of german communism zetkin and rosa luxemburg at the socialist internationale in advocated for a women s day but the date was not set in stone till when the ussr officially adopted march th which was selected to commemorate a specific date that led to the russian revolution specifically a workers strike at a weapons factory in petrograd the women workers strike that modern feminists claim was the inspiration for international women s day did not start until march th moving to the united states in the pioneering declaration of sentiments from seneca falls in generally taken as the seminal text of the first wave of feminism though i would argue that it s actually the second after de gouges declaration the claim was made that the history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her this is not justified by the history of men risking their lives both in work and war to provide for and protect women their families and their homes granted the text highlights a series of injustices that women were subject to however such a claim remains myopic and misleading under coverture legislation for example while husbands did become the legal owner of all family assets in reality this came with responsibilities and wives were not left entirely devoid of rights their rights were simply different husbands could be criminalised for failure to keep their families as well as he could reasonably be expected wives permission was required to sell any houses owned by the family and actually if a member of a man s household ran up debts he was legally responsible for their repayment yes women deserved to be granted various rights but so did men who did not deserve the derision they received from first wave feminists including christabel pankhurst who notably explained in her book the great scourge that men were little more than carriers of venereal disease furthermore in his volume the fraud of feminism ernest belfort bax identified two distinct sides to feminism an articulate political and economic side embracing demands for so called rights legitimately and a sentimental side which insists on an accentuation of privileges and immunities there is no mention in the declaration of sentiments or any first wave texts of the privileges and immunities enjoyed by women nor any injustices faced by men the women s suffrage movement in the u s was tainted by racism although an african american abolitionist frederick douglas did take to the stage at seneca falls no african american women are believed to have been present furthermore feminist heroines like elizabeth cady staton who organized the meeting at seneca falls and was a co author of the declaration embraced her racism explicitly characterising black men as inherently inclined towards rape throughout her career she also argued vehemently against the thamendment that would extend the vote to african american men claiming that it would degrade women to follow black men into the franchise the women s social and political union or suffragettes in the u k were not afflicted by racism they actually took pride in the strength of support for women s suffrage throughout the british empire the night before the coronation of george v in a demonstration was held to demand the right for women to vote which featured an empire pageant featuring representatives from india australia new zealand south africa and the west indies and indian princess sophia duleep singh was a major donor they were not however devoid of bigotry and i don t just mean towards men british suffragettes held a special contempt for the working classes not only did they fail to rally behind the truly progressive call for universal suffrage preferring to campaign for women to be able to vote on the same terms as men ie with property qualifications but they embarked on a campaign of terrorism that may have hurt some middle and upper class opponents or insufficiently active supporters financially but would put working class lives in both direct and indirect danger they smashed shop windows and burned or bombed industrial premises including a lino factory a laundry woodyards and freight yards they also targeted the caf at kew gardens with an arson attack destroying a business that was owned and staffed by women and destroying their livelihoods in a pre welfare state society when the proprietor went to the wspu to complain she was told that she was taking too personal a view of the matter and that the staff would no doubt be glad that they had lent support to the women s cause homes were targeted one was that of the chancellor of the exchequer lloyd george which was empty under renovation the bomb exploded just before his builders were due to start work so narrowly avoided injuring them it did however destroy tools which were provided by the men themselves who may well have ended up on the streets or in the workhouse as a result of their loss other houses though the suffragettes insisted that they only targeted them when empty actually contained staff who were put at risk sulphuric acid and phosphorus in letter bombs caused a number of postmen to suffer severe lung damage and or burns a bomb planted outside the bank of england would if it had not been defused by a policeman have gone off in a busy commercial area mid afternoon a bomb at lime street station liverpool was packed with nuts and bolts to maximise harm a bomb containing cartridges of gunpowder was placed in the toilets of a theatre to go off during a matinee performance the congregation at st john s smith square had to put out a bomb containing lb of gunpowder another bomb was chucked into a full territorial army barracks the jockey whose horse ran over emily davison at epsom in herbert jones suffered flashbacks to the event throughout his life until he committed suicide in the idea of these women as noble heroines is an outrage to any right thinking person and the idea that their terrorism led to the extension of the vote is implausible they dropped their suffrage campaign entirely with the onset of ww and a grant from the government and embarked upon their white feather campaign for which they have further blood on their hands universal suffrage was won by quietly committed lobbying from the suffragist movement and the sacrifice of so many working class men in the war to understand the evolution of feminism from first to second wave we need to look at the birth of critical theory critical theory emerged from the intellectual collective known as the frankfurt school they began their mission in with the establishment of the institute for social research at the university of frankfurt initially founder felix weil and director carl grunberg along with fellow orthodox marxists tasked themselves with making marxism a viable alternative economic system to rival capitalism but from under new director max horkheimer the focus shifted to an examination of the culture out of which capitalism flourishes in order to subvert it to accommodate marxism thus critical theory was established the group moved its activities to the u s in in response to the rise of hitler to become associated with the university of columbia in new york here erich fromm pioneered the marriage of marxist theory with freudian theory and characterised the family which they rightly identified as the building blocks of capitalism as repressive and pathological herbert marcuse s eros and civilization was published in in which a society based on free love and no work that liberated the human natures that he felt were being repressed by capitalist society was proposed this book was a major channel through which neo marxist ideas fed into various liberation movements in the s including of course feminism of feminism marcuse claimed that the women s liberation movement is perhaps the most important and potentially the most radical political movement that we have marcuse s sentiments were echoed by shulamith firestone founder of the redstockings collective who published the dialectic of sex in another utopian or dystopian depending on your perspective radical classic that argued that the domination of men as a sex class over women as a sex class or underclass was based in biology which needed to be overcome through advances in medical science that would liberate women from the barbaric practise of childbirth she held the nuclear family which she labelled a tyranny in contempt and advocated for rationally constructed non permanent bonding relationships between people who voluntarily undertook their upbringing in which the dependence of the child on the mother and vice versa would give way to a greatly shortened dependence on a small group of others in general kate millet s sister recollected a consciousness raising group that she attended with kate in the new york of that opened with a back and forth recitation why are we here today to make revolution what kind of revolution the cultural revolution and how do we make cultural revolution by destroying the american family how do we destroy the family by destroying the american patriarch it goes on but you get the gist feminism became the leading vanguard in the subversion and desecration of a comparatively decent prosperous civilisation their battle in this culture war was the decimation of the family and they would achieve victory in that battle by destroying men a process they would enact by attrition of the esteem in which men were held their identities and eventually their rights a host of extreme misandrists poured forth bile during this period thinkers like andrea dworkin under patriarchy every woman s son is her potential betrayer and also the inevitable rapist or exploiter of another woman catherine mackinnon male sexuality is apparently activated by violence against women and expresses itself in violence against women to a significant extent valerie solanas to call a man an animal is to flatter him robin morgan i feel that man hating is an honourable and viable political act germaine greer men are the enemy shulamith firestone all men are selfish brutal and inconsiderate marilyn french all men are rapists and that s all they are however i think it s well worth looking at the more apparently benign representatives of the movement and unpicking what they had to say in irina dunn coined the phrase a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle which was popularised later by gloria steinem referring to whom i ask to the countless generations of men who had endured the dirtiest most dangerous and thankless labour to support their families to their relatively recent male ancestors who fought for women s suffrage such as jeremy bentham and henry fawcett and the elected representatives who would ensure such legislation passed such as john stuart mill whose male constituents elected him on a platform including female suffrage to their fathers who may well have participated in world war two to protect their societies and families to their brothers friends lovers i believe gloria steinem had many of those and was supported morally and financially by a number of them too it may sound cute and catchy but it s both contemptibly narcissistic nonsense and reprehensibly offensive second wave feminism saw campaigns for equal pay which was realised in with the equal pay act in the u s and in in the u k with our equal pay act it is of course entirely fair to legislate against malicious sex discrimination but as we can see from the landmark case that led to barbara castle implementing the u k s equal pay act the nature of the acts is far more expansive responding not to simply the same jobs but to work of an equal value the ford dagenham machinists strike in followed a re grading exercise by ford who classified sewing seat covers for cars predominantly performed by women as less skilled than jobs on the production line largely done by men resulting in a fifteen per cent pay disparity and the court to which the case was referred found in ford s favour there was no sex discrimination in this famous case simply fair pay for different roles but feminist activism continues to force the hands of employers not to make rational economic gradings but to ensure that men and women go home with increasingly similar pay packets regardless of relevant factors and hey it has almost certainly led to less pay for patriarchs weakening their ability to provide for their families and putting stress on their relationships so it s a win win for feminism second wave feminists also fought for access to contraceptive pills and abortions the pill entered the u s market in but it wasn t until there that it was made available to single women and previously being at the discretion of individual medical practitioners in the u k it was incorporated into the national health service by barbara castle in this has led to far greater choice for women in terms of life paths more sexual freedom and better physical health outcomes and yet some have experienced a historically new pressure to be sexually active and a corresponding ennui in response to their sex lives whether they believe they re lacking or they fail to find meaning in casual sex abortion was legalized in in scotland england and wales and found to be a constitutional right in in the u s there has always been a proportion of women who have killed their babies bodies of new borns believed to have been suffocated at birth have often been found behind roman villas and prior to the act women turned to untrained practitioners who would administer folk medicines or insert knitting needles into the womb through the cervix and obviously medicalised abortion up to a certain point is more humane for both the unborn child and the mother and far safer for the latter however the callousness with which feminist activists typically have and still do approach the subject shows no concern for the sanctity of human life and precious little for the psychological well being of the women who are told that expelling a clump of cells is a liberating act that will have no deleterious impact on her whatsoever yet alone any sympathy for the men involved a concerted struggle on the part of radical feminists began against pornography during the second wave feminist campaigners like andrea dworkin and catherine mackinnon joined forces with the religious right to raise concerns about trafficking and coercion in the industry and claimed that men s consumption of porn led to increased risk of sexual assault and rape for women in free societies as well as diminishing their capacity to be viewed as full human beings in the u s several states enacted local ordinances that intended to treat porn as a violation of women s civil rights and to allow women who believe they have been harmed by porn to seek damages in civil courts the dworkin mackinnon ordinances were opposed as a threat to women s freedoms by sex positive feminists such as camille paglia and wendy mcelroy and were eventually shot down as violations of the first amendment the third wave of feminism emerged in the s it is characterised by intersectionality rebecca walker one of the founders explained that feminism in order to stay relevant had to become about more than gender equality in an effort to be more inclusive third wavers have embraced the grievances of well anyone who will identify straight white men as the problem with literally no rights to be won feminism became increasingly navel gazing or more specifically a little lower and obsessed over the minutiae of female existence in the modern western world finding oppression and abuse everywhere from the make up aisle to the bedroom on university campuses posters were going up with the ms magazine study statistic that one in four college women was the victim of rape or attempted rape this feminist lie was concocted by dr mary koss who broadened the definition beyond any reasonable limit and in defiance of the of her apparent victims who did not classify their experiences as rape take back the night marches were growing with participants chanting no more date rape and giving emotional monologues about mistreatment at the hands of men a moral panic was underway that still resonates darkly today if paglia mcelroy and their sex positive cohort thought that they had won the war for the hearts and minds of liberated young women in the s they were to be dramatically disproven just a decade later by an anxious and vulnerable generation of feminists in the duluth model was created in duluth minnesota founded by ellen pence not i believe related to mike but certainly a good reason for his rule used in all u s states although recently seriously weakened by donald trump as well as other countries including the u k the duluth model is a gendered theory based on feminist beliefs it contends that men s violence towards women is based on a sense of entitlement arising from being part of the privileged sex class in a patriarchy moreover it expands the definition of domestic violence to include all manner of behaviours from threatening to leave her or commit suicide to displaying weapons to making her feel guilty to making big decisions to giving her an allowance it s a mix of both clearly abusive behaviours and behaviours that exist in a very grey area that could conceivably be part of fairly healthy relationships there is very little room left in duluth model theory or indeed the agencies that employ it for male victims of domestic violence especially where it s perpetrated by women and it is a recognised phenomenon to see male victims end up in duluth inspired abuser intervention programmes that teach them that their masculinity is problematic erin pizzey founder of the first u k women s shelter describes the lead up to such instances using the acronym darvo it stands for deny attack and reverse victim and offender she says that a particular trait of women abusers when confronted with their behaviour for example by the police is to turn the tables on their victim by claiming to be the victim themselves a police force informed by duluth of course is inclined to believe her and now a new wave of feminism appears to be quickening with a schism between older third wavers and a new generation rene denfield writes that current feminists promote a new status for women that of the victim while naomi wolf laments that a substantial segment of modern feminism is devoted to victimhood in recent decades feminists have successfully promoted the idea of believing the victim in cases of alleged violence harassment or sexual misconduct against women regardless of available evidence in the words of lena dunham things women don t lie about rape this subjective reasoning has led to campus rape trials in kangaroo courts across the u s australia and canada they ve been advocated for here in the u k but remain to be implemented although the varsity student newspaper informs me that they re under serious consideration here at cambridge now they are governed by amateurs with inadequate legal training who are given licence to assess innocence or guilt with a balance of probabilities standard of adjudication with this trend we are witnessing a move away from the longstanding legal principle of innocent till proven guilty and toward the dangerous principle of guilty till proven innocent paving the way for the systematic ruination of innocent lives and the current state of affairs is not enough for some feminists who want to see men not guilty till proven innocent but guilty upon accusation julie lalonde an expert brought into ottawa university during the hysteria around a rape allegation that proved false to tackle the institutions rape culture believes that every time we see a high profile sexual assault trial result in an acquittal it sends women back years end quote and emily lindin tweeted that i m actually not at all concerned about innocent men losing their jobs over false sexual assault harassment allegations under feminist director of public prosecutions alison saunders the u k s criminal prosecution service became embroiled in a scandal wherein targets set for rape and sexual assault prosecutions encouraged police forces to withhold exonerating evidence from courts innocent men were incarcerated that s a fact and as a rule their victimisers have retained anonymity and avoided their own well deserved sentences for perjury the metoo movement has proven itself to be a malevolent witch hunt with a body count a prime example of feminist aggression into the lives of non feminist men and women who do not need feminism to dictate acceptable behaviour at best it can only serve to diminish the romance comedy and beauty as well as some discomfort and tragedy in other words the colour from our lives as camille paglia pointed out leaving sex to the feminists is like letting your dog vacation at the taxidermist at worst it serves to destroy men professionally personally legally or even totally in august brendan o neil counted four suicides as a result of metoo allegations benny frederickson head of a stockholm arts centre carl sargeant and an unnamed labour party activist and jill messick a movie producer who killed herself as a result of harassment she received for defending harvey weinstein since then i have counted another four swaroop raj a noida technician from india american skating champion john coughlin arghya basu filmmaker and armando vega gil mexican rockstar who committed suicide after an anonymous woman claimed that he told her he would like to teach her to kiss when she was and he was i have no doubt that there are many that we have missed and the climate of everyday misandry pouring forth from feminists is relentless suzanna danuta walters asked why can t we hate men we have every right to hate you a segment on abc s tonightly with tom ballard programme featured women sarcastically thanking men in general for drugging and raping women laurie penny announced in response to the capital gazette massacre that we must not allow our society to be held hostage to white male fragility any longer and barack obama complained that men have been getting on my nerves lately i just think brothers what s wrong with you guys what s wrong with us i mean we re violent we re bullying chidera eggerue aka the slumflower tweeted that if men are committing suicide because they can t cry how s it my concern most fourth wave feminists though like to cover their misandry with platitudes about wanting to liberate men from the toxic expectations society places on them they live in this alternate reality wherein uninhibited male aggression and violence are pardoned by the mantra boys will be boys and wherein violence as a means of defending pride is glamorized fourth wave feminists are unconcerned with truth however their goal is power the power to penalise the most successful men in order to privilege women quotas and other forms of discrimination and the power to demonise men collectively in order to defend and extend the ability of women to destroy men in general along with the power to silence any men or women that dare to oppose their baseless narratives regardless of whether a behaviour is innocuous or women engage in equivalent behaviour if a man does anything feminists oppose it in the last few years snappy feminist portmanteaus such as manspreading mansplaining and manteruppting have proliferated and become ubiquitous in their use the aim is to shame silence and bludgeon men into compliance masculinity as a whole is utterly vilified and demonized in our societies the endeavour can begin at school intensifies in university and in the workplace increasingly and reaches a tragic crescendo in family courts where men are denied access to their children who would bring such critically important meaning to their lives and be the ultimate expression of their masculinity there is a gender justice gap for those convicted of crimes sex discrimination in the u k criminal justice system has a long history e g flogging as a punishment for female criminals was banned in but continued for men until that s years presently men account for around of the total prison population despite only committing times more crimes than women factors that explain this disparity include a greater percentage of convicted men being sentenced to prison men being given longer sentences on average than women women being paroled earlier than men despite being more likely to be disciplined for bad behaviour whilst incarcerated and women being more likely to have mitigating factors such as age dependents lack of previous relevant convictions and the appearance of genuine remorse applied to their sentences and yet feminist activists such as women in prisons baroness corston and julie bindel have committed themselves to widening the gender justice gap enabled by sentimental authorities our tory government has committed itself to taking a rehabilitative approach when dealing with women offenders which i think is great but the voices of our male offenders as well as the experts on effective justice are utterly ignored when they raise the question what about the men the cultural obsession with the gender pay gap is being driven by disingenuous authoritarian feminists with no regard for personal choice meritocracy or human well being the focus is exclusively on the mythical glass ceiling with no interest paid to the fate of those men employed in the glass cellar dangerous and dirty jobs that women don t want who are increasingly at risk of unemployment due to automation and or the ever present risks of workplace injury and death quotas are being used by many organisations which discriminate against men sometimes caucasian men specifically this is not only immoral in that it unfairly disadvantages individuals but also frankly stupid with the potential to impair the functioning of sectors rejecting meritocracy and therefore the economy and society in general moreover the clunky way in which the government has demanded that businesses publish their gender pay gap statistics may ultimately lead to men being chosen over women for the kind of minimum wage jobs that very few do out of choice equal pay is being acquired for women performing even dissimilar roles to male counterparts regardless of relevant facts such as whether they work fewer hours for example the bbc s former china editor carrie gracie was awarded in back pay to bring her earnings in line with jon sopel the north america editor despite the fact that his job was more intensive and he was on air significantly more than her she has donated her pay out to the fawcett society there are also several battles raging to secure equal pay for mainly female supermarket store workers as mainly male warehouse workers an asda spokesman clarified in response to coverage consistently suggesting otherwise that at asda hourly paid colleagues doing the same job in the same location are paid the same men and women doing the same job in our retail stores are paid the same men and women doing the same job in our distribution centres are paid the same pay rates in stores differ from pay rates in distribution centres for legitimate reasons end quote differences in comfort exertion and safety in the roles have been labelled entirely illegitimate reasons to offer different levels of pay to workers in the coverage of the stories and the court of appeal agreed earlier this year and ruled against asda now the u k is facing the extension of hate crime legislation to include the charge of misogyny in line with current hate crime legislation the charge will require no evidence of hateful motivations but rather be governed by the perception of the victim or any witnesses involved this shameful waste of police time will offer another avenue for malicious women to use the law to harm innocent men as well as diverting precious resources from the fight against actual crime and do not think that these crimes will not be acted upon by sensible officers a perception of indifference from the police in such instances will be treated as it is with current hate crimes as secondary victimisation with greater manchester police clarifying that action will be taken against police accused of indifference towards victims and whether or not it is reasonable for them to perceive it that way is immaterial end quote in the interests of nuance i accept that there have been and are individuals who identify as feminist who don t fit into the negative description of the movement that i ve just given there are feminists who want equal rights for men and women equal treatment choices opportunities feminists who have compassion for men and value them but what impact have they really had on the trajectory and achievements of the movement they ve been marginalised heretics pleading intelligently and rationally but essentially ineffectually with their hysterical peers while their hysterical peers have been lobbying our institutions irresponsibly and illogically but consistently successfully for policies and procedures that are damaging our societies feminism though once it was at least partially in practice is now progressive in name only feminists don t look around at our wonderful civilisation with gratitude and awe and want only to extend and protect the liberal values that have brought us here feminists look at our civilisation with anger and malice and want to burn it to the ground rending our liberal values assunder and to remake it in their own image and feminists understand that power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in shapes of your own choosing as orwell explained through o brien in that s why the epicentre of feminist indoctrination is in the education system where young and malleable minds proliferate to be manipulated by feminist historiography thankfully we non feminist women and men are studying and expressing our findings and more and more individuals are learning to see through the feminist narrative i look forward to a post feminist future

5262,gt fact checking false rape accusations and why we shouldn t fear a false rape epidemic gt gt gt gt one of the main resistance to changes in how police and society handle rape sexual assault and even harassment is the counter argument that men then would be plagued by false rape accusations the fear is always that we crossed some line that no longer allows reasonable doubt and that one man life can be sent to jail by one accusation we of course have seen stories of such things in the news and everytime we question wither these are isolated stories or a sign of a larger epidemic we don t get to see when does the drive of combating rape go to far is it an issue to fear gt gt so how common is this issue is it really a threat to men how many false rape accusations are there gt gt how many false rape accusations are there gt gt most experts agree that false rape accusations make the total of of the total accusations of rape as quoted from the handbook gt gt a multi site study of eight u s communities including cases of sexual assault found a of false reports lonsway archambault amp lisak gt gt link to it here gt gt gt a study of sexual assault cases in boston from found a of false reports lisak et al gt gt using qualitative and quantitative analysis researchers studied reports of sexual assault from and found a of false reports heenan amp murray gt gt and why not add some more papers to the mix gt gt study into the fbi database found that between to the average number of false rape accusations or baseless accusations was and robbery had a higher false and baseless accusation rate of gt gt another metastudy by claire e ferguson and john m malouff published in december th put the number of false rape accusations at amp x b so keep in mind that all of these numbers are minimums these all represent the number of false rape accusations made to the police that provably false using rigorous standards amp x b and while it may be small the is actually they round that number down to so it s only fair to round the up to you can either say or you can say it s a small thing but it irks me amp x b but all of these numbers are minimums just like when of cases end up with convictions that means a minimum of of rape cases taken to the police are true a minimum this three minute youtube sums it up very well amp x b amp x b gt now i know that is alot and enough to give anyone pause considering how epidemic sexual assault is but consider a few things gt gt in of women report they have been sexually assaulted amp x b if you check the link it takes you to rainn the in women will be rape in their lifetime comes from where i checked the footnote oh it s from national institute of justice amp centers for disease control amp prevention prevalence incidence and consequences of violence against women survey this is the precursor to the cdc nisvs survey guess what the cdc nisvs survey also found it found that for years of female perpetrated made to penetrate sexual assault on men rape for lack of a better word was at parity with male perpetrated rape for these years let that sink in for a minute when you are done letting that sink in ask yourself why a sub called r menslib is not mentioning that in there were over million instances of female on male rapes according to the cdc nisvs survey in although they don t call it that but prefer the more awkward made to penetrate sexual assault this links to the cdc nisvs survey data so you can check for yourself the lifetime stats are much lower than the year over year and despite my inquiries to the cdc i have not gotten an answer as for why that is however for each year of and we find parity between the sexes for sexual assault rape perpetration look at the month data amp x b this blog does a very good job of breaking this down amp x b gt only a rd of sexual assaults are reported to police so at its of gt gt this statistic covers if or not an accusation is false wither or

x b this is a nice rabbit pulled out of the hat why are we assuming that all of the sexual assaults not reported to the police are true i for one have been the collateral damage victim of a false baseless rape accusation made on social media ostensibly rape accusations that are not taken to the police and are merely posted on twitter facebook or added a circulating anonymous rapist list or made at a bar or something are more likely to be false not less yet this author would have you believe that they are all true magic of course there are many rapes that happen that are never taken to the police for example the million incidents of female on male made to penetrate rape that i mentioned above almost none of these are reported less than percent these male victims of female perpetrators are hidden by systemic cultural bias amp x b gt soo how many false rape allegations lead to false arrests and convictions then gt gt how many people falsely accused of rape actually go to jail gt gt thankfully we found that the answer is very low gt gt national registry of exoneration who keeps track of how many innocent people have been well exonerated found that since in the us people have been exonerated for sexual assault that they didn t do people exonerated on false accusations of murder was people gt gt gt gt gt gt note innocent project has listed exonerated with sex crimes this is the highest number i can find thanks u mealreadytoeat gt gt british home office did a detailed study and report on the issues of false rape accusations in and found that out of the cases of rape that was false in the uk of them have a formal complain filed by the accuser of them had a named suspect and only of them were arrested out of the arrested only have charges and of them had a conviction gt gt another study by the university of pittsburgh found that only of false rape accusastions name a suspect amp x b nevermind the fact in the fbi backtested over rapekits and found that in excluded the primary suspect in almost all cases as fingered by the primary witness alleged victim conducted in june the nationwide telephone survey of public and private laboratories that performed dna tests sought answers to such questions as from the time the laboratories began dna testing how many cases have they handled of that number what percentage yielded results that excluded defendants as sources of the dna evidence or were inconclusive the surveyed laboratories yielded whose available data were sufficient for the purposes of this study the included at the state local level in the private sector an armed forces laboratory and the fbi s laboratory most of the laboratories had initiated dna testing only within the previous few years twelve began testing between and three of the four private laboratories began in or while the fbi started dna testing in seven of the laboratories reported using rflp testing four pcr testing and eight both types of tests the laboratories reported that since they began testing they had received evidence in cases for dna analysis with the fbi accounting for cases three of the private laboratories averaged each the state and local laboratories averaged each in about percent of the cases dna test results excluded suspects according to respondents an additional percent of the cases approximately yielded inconclusive results often because the test samples had deteriorated or were too small inconclusive results aside test results in the balance of the cases did not exclude the suspect the fbi reported that in the cases it received dna testing results were about percent inconclusive and percent exclusion the other laboratories cases reported about percent and percent respectively unfortunately the laboratories were unable to provide more details they did not maintain data bases that would permit categorization of dna test results by type of offense and other criteria what happened to the suspects who were excluded through dna testing also cannot be determined were they released or were they charged on the basis of other evidence for example thus only the most general information is known about the results of dna testing by laboratories to obtain more detailed information would require a comprehensive research project that s hard forensic data that puts the ballpark figure of false rape accusation at about in now to be fair some of these may have been genuine mistaken identity but if you are the man under arrest by the police accused of rape you would call that a false rape accusation amp x b amp x b gt fact is that the majority of false rape accusations don t even name a suspect and throwing this into the picture of the total of the numbers of rape really proves how rare false rape convictions are vast majority of false rape accusers always accuse a non existent stranger who raped them and usually not someone specifically which means that beyond wasting time and resources majority of false rape accusations are harmless to the general public because no one person is accused gt gt when you take these studies and add them to what we already know about rape a more complete picture forms gt gt women claim to have experience sexual assault follow by a reporting the assault to police then worst case scenario are false out of those false rape accusations name a suspect out of false rape accusations that accuse someone get an arrest and out of those who are arrested for a rape they didn t do only have charges placed against them amp x b this is so wrong as to be a lie remember according to dr lisak s metastudy a minimum of percent of all rape accusations taken to the police are proven to be false amp x b gt so x x x x x gt gt which mean out of all the women you meet you have a chance of being falsely charged of rape a blood vessel in my frontal lobe just exploded i can t even begin to understand what the heck he is doing with the numbers here can anyone help me out with this like i have a headache just from trying amp x b gt compare this to the fact that of men openly admitted of committing the strictest possible definition of rape and of that admitted of multiple rapes amp x b this link is dead but let s look at a couple other studies that look at the number of people openly admitting to committing rape hogben byrne amp hamburger lifetime prevalence of for women having made a man engage in sexual activity against his will sexually aggressive women anderson struckman johnson of college women admitted to using verbal or physical pressure to obtain sex no ebook available i ve ordered a print copy in the mail but it won t arrive for another week i m just saying there is one half of the equation being left out here it is likely the smaller half but why are we still pretending in like it doesn t happen it happens all the time go check out r teacherswhorape for a daily update of female pedophiles amp x b amp x b gt why false rape accusations happen gt gt many people who fear false rape accusations claim that women in the work force will make a false accusation against a man in a higher position or a student who is going to fail an exam will accuse a professor or rape or that a vengeful ex or a woman who regretted sex later gt gt but the realities of this is very surprising gt gt according to a review done by the lapd found the reasons for a false rape accusations is unwanted pregnancies or more commonly missed curfews by young teenagers it turns out that of false rape accusations according to this review are for hope of getting medical care or psychiatric medication by the very poor and destitute gt gt also it is noted that half of the false rape accusations are made by parents of children either by pressuring the child to go to the police or accusing someone of rape without the child knowing it is also important to note that the rare serial false rape accusers tend to have a history of being a legitimate victim sexual abuse as a child gt gt as this shows that the false accuser the majority of the time aren t the serial accusers we hear on the media nor are in tech jobs nor college students who regret sex instead it is usually either the very poor looking for free medication teenagers trying to get out of trouble and parents of children who make the vast majority of false rape accusations gt gt also there are no corolations with the age of the accusation or the number of sexual partners of the accuser and wither their accusations are true or not add this to the fact that most legitimate victims lie to themselves and others saying that they weren t sexually assaulted when they really were this denial often is due to the fact that the majority of victims know their abusers personally before the assault and often change their stories or denied that they were as a way to cope the trauma i can personally attest to that gt gt special thanks to u ilikeneurons amp x b why does he leave out de zutter reasons for a false rape accusation material gain to receive money professional promotion or other material benefits producing an alibi a false allegation is used to cover up other behaviour such as being late or absent to an appointment revenge to retaliate against a disliked person by damaging the reputation freedom or finances attention an attempt to receive any kind of attention positive or negative by anyone sympathy a special kind of attention seeking whereby the complainant tries to improve a personal relationship with a specific individual a disturbed mental state this may include false memories sexual hallucinations or pathologic lying relabeling consensual sex is relabeled rape to the police because of its disappointing or shameful character de zutter et al argue that a distinction should be made between some acts during a consensual sexual encounter that a participant did not want or had no desire to engage in but nonetheless gave consent to e g to please their partner on the one hand and rape nonconsensual sex on the other but that many lay people and even some scholars do not make this distinction and confuse the two it is often when accounts of such unwanted consensual sex are told to friends and family that the latter interpret it as rape and put the complainant under pressure to file an allegation regret after having had consensual sex a complainant experiences negative feelings such as disgust shame and sorrow when others notice this and ask about the source of these negative feelings they are prone to view the encounter as rape and put the complainant under pressure to file an allegation don t know according to de zutter et al of complainants said that they did not know why they had filed a false allegation amp x b while we are at it wikipedia also lists false memories as a reason for a false rape accusation false memories edit there are several ways in which an alleged victim can accidentally come to believe that they have been raped by the person s they accuse these include but are not limited to recovered memory therapy memories of sexual abuse recovered during therapy in the absence of any supporting evidence based on the freudian notion of repression the victim s confusion of the memory of the real rapist with the memory of someone else memory conformity memory can become contaminated when co witnesses discuss their recall of events amp x b let s not forget that in the uk alleged rape victims are paid in cash regardless of whether the accused is found guilty or not jemma beale collected pounds before being caught that s a hell of a side gig falsely accused nine men of raping her on separate occasions while a further six had supposedly sexually assaulted her she is unique in that she is one of the rare false rape accusers to be prosecuted amp x b amp x b gt why didn t you include those other studies gt gt since i am from the future i know this will be bring up sooo i will nip it in the butt before it shows up in the comments and if they still show up without talking about this section of my effort post you have my permission to shame them small thing but the saying is nip in the bud like a plant shame is how feminism works right they shame people into submission like metoo if you stand up to a false rape accusation they shame you as a rape apologist amp x b gt people who fear the false accusation epidemic that is supposedly happening like to point to the other studies on these issues what are these other studies and why don t i use them in my analysts well because they are bad flat out bad or rely on a misconception of the nature of sexual assault and there are alot of them lets take sample out of the list wikipedia provided amp x b gt also these studies expose a much larger issue when it comes to research into sexual assault what is sexual assault and what is false sexual assault when you look at studies the older ones tend to have uhhhhhh questionable views of what is and isn t sexual assault i would say the same argument could be flipped on the new definitions of rape coming our of academic feminism amp x b gt then if you look at other higher studies like kanin and jordan you figure out that they are working on the police definitions of false or not unfortunately that means that they consider a story false if the victim gt gt failed a polygraph click here if you wanna know why the polygraph is bullshit gt gt if the victim delayed reporting their rape gt gt if the victim was intellectually impaired gt gt if the victim has signs of mental illness gt gt if the victim was intoxicated gt gt if the victim withdraw the complaint gt gt and if the victim was determined by police to be a slut amp x b amp x b there are criticism to make of kanin small sample size sure undisclosed location also iffy but according to kanin the police only classified an accusation as false if the alleged victim confessed to it being false and they were able to corroborate the new story with the defendant and other witnesses it did involve a serious but not mandatory offer of a polygraph test but the offer of the polygraph test was merely a catalyst an accusation was on classified as false if the alleged victim herself recanted in of the cases the alleged victim did so there are legitimate concerns about this study i listed above but the author has told another lie no accusation was regarded as false at any time because of a failed polygraph or for any of the above listed reasons i ll have to read the jordan study because the author definitely lied about kanin so i can assume he probably lied about jordan as well in fact i completely distrust this guy amp x b gt while false complaints do occur approximately three quarters of the incidents concluded by the police to be false appeared to have been judged to some extent at least on the basis of stereotypes regarding the complainant s behavior attitude demeanor or possible motive suspicious file comments were made by the detectives regarding a woman who laughed while being interviewed others who were seen as attention seeking and some who were said to be crying rape for revenge or guilt motives attention seeking revenge and guilt are all common and legitimate motivation for a false rape accusation according to self confessed accounts accumulated by de zutter see above amp x b gt that s right of false rape accusations labeled as such by police were not because they were proven false but on the gut feelings of the police which means we get plenty of false false rape accusations this is probably a bigger issue then men being falsely accused of rape there have been plenty of documented cases of police pressuring victims to sign false confessions claiming they made up their sexual assaults its why one of the major reasons why out of rapes only rapists will go to jail while for robberies will go to jail and of assault and battery gt gt using fear as a weaponwhy do we talk about false rape allegations all the time and how its used as a political weapon the police deal with the shittiest people of society all day every day you are allowed to be skeptical of the police you are not allowed to completely write them off i call bullshit it might not be as high as but it s high in the uk false rape accusations are so common that police now demand that alleged victims hand over their phones when making an accusation that can check to see if they texted the accused the following morning something like thank you for the great sex last night amp x b gt though most rational people don t see this as such a major issues within far conservatism and the manosphere you tend to see false accusations be pushed as the major issue against men in fact i decided to do my own study where i went to r menrights typed it rape and look at the top posts by r menrights on the subject i only accepted posts of two categories male victims of sexual assault and stories on false rape accusations as expected r menrights had more posts about false rape then male victims of rape stop kidding yourself false rape accusations are a huge concern for men innocence is no defense against a rape accusation your life your reputation your friends you family your career your honor your legacy are all permanently and irrevocably damaged by a false rape accusation it s shameful amp x b gt as you can see despite the fact that men are in in odds of being raped that in rape victims are male and as stated before only of rape accusations lead to a man being arrested as stated above mras post more about and care more about false rape accusations then male victims of sexual assault why is that why do we even talk about false rape so much if its more rare than males being raped i get a suspicion that plenty who champion this cause are arguing disingenuously interesting that he mentions a man being arrested but how come so few women are arrest for rape even though there are multiple studies going back to the s indicating it s massively underreported amp x b false rape accusations are not rare they are at least percent of all rape accusations taken to the police i d bet that number is much higher since the metoo movement when every single sociopathic liar knows that they will be believed oftentimes in spite of evidence amp x b false accusations are rampant enough that only segregation can solve it gt yeaaaa this covers harassment as well plenty of people have been using the fear of false rape accusations against men as proof that women should be isolated they also openly brag to each other that they won t hire more qualified women because i am too scared of a lawsuit as stated before the case of someone falsely accusing someone else in the workplace environment is ultra rare as most false rapes come from children or the homeless and the vast majority don t name suspects if anything men should be worried about sexual harassment from coworkers as it is way more statistically likely that men will be a victim of sexual harassment then falsely accuse of harassment themselves choose one adopt a believewomen policy and eliminated due process for men in the workplace or demand that women be hired at equal rates as men amp x b gt false rape accusers should get same length sentence as rapists gt gt this is a common cry for those within the mra movement is that these false accusers are getting off to easy that they ruin countless men lives and only get slap of the wrists but that shows a great error in their thinking is the trust that the criminal justice system gives just punishments to rapists in the first place if we are going to punish false accusers the same way that we do punish rapists then false accusers should get gt gt years of probation gt gt months of jail gt gt years of probation amp x b instead of listing three anecdotes how about some actual data prison sentences for rape are not uniform a study made by the u s department of justice of prison releases in involving about percent of the prison population found that the average sentence for convicted rapists was years while the actual time served was years but just for fun let s look at three false rape accusations that resulted in jail time colo man imprisoned for years after woman dreamed he raped her expected to be freed after convicted rapist admits to crime accused of florida rape years ago black men get posthumous pardons lest we forget emmett till amp x b amp x b gt that of course doesn t count the countless who have sexually assaulted and get away with it if mras called for this guideline i can t help to feel they would be even more disappointed in the sentencing expecting years but irl only getting a few months if we treated false rape accusers the same as rapists then we as a society wouldn t take them that seriously for both men and for women countless women who have sexually assaulted and gotten away with it amp x b gt also i want to quickly address the other mras call for those who have been falsely accused to be placed on the sex offender registry lists uuuuuuuhhh what this is improper use of such a list number and that publicly available list would then create a public list of people you can rape without repercussions think about it if you publicly branded people as false rape accuser then which people would rapists target amp x b i m actually opposed to the sex offender registry lists as they currently stand in our country female pedophiles are very often offered a plea deal to stay off the registry amp x b amp x b gt putting extra laws and punishments on this mush smaller issue of false rape accusations put more pressure on legitimate victims of sexual assault under the existing law there are cases of legit victims being classified by police as false victims if you add additional punishment then we will punish legitimate victims of rape years in prison for just reporting their rape and police not believing in them and that will have a chilling effect on the rest of victims of sexual assault out there its hard enough as is but if you are unable to prove it and you act like a slut then you could face jail time this is just as true for rape victims the uk is seeing an influx of innocent men convicted of rape because of horrible believewomen policies it is an actual nightmare i think false rape accusations need to be rigorously prosecuted when there is substantial evidence of malicious intent just because the defendant is not convicted doesn t mean it was a false rape accusation but in many cases there is evidence of clear malicious intent yet the false accuser is not punished lest we discourage others from coming forward other false accusers amp x b also check out r falserapeaccusations amp x b amp x b gt conclusion amp x b gt that s why r menrights and reddit as a whole under reports on male victims of rape because admitting that rape of men is a common thing only helps prove that rape in general is a very common affair and that the in statistic was right the whole time that rape is a real problem in western society and forces them to stop ignoring it amp x b multiple written lies have been told by the author of this post when it was first posted a great many redditors pointed out how poorly his math was put together instead of changing or editing his post he merely deleted the comments that is called suppression of the truth and it makes you a bad person amp x b no one is denying that rape is a serious issue the good news is that according to the boj rape along with other violent crimes has been dropping steadily since the s in the number pivoted because for the first time in usa history the fbi legally acknowledged that men can be raped unfortunately it has been worded such that female on male made to penetrate sexual assault is still not rape women can only rape men if they anally penetrate them we still have a long way to go for true gender equality amp x b so remember this tl dr when you think about false rape accusations gt tl dr gt gt for both genders you are way more likely to be raped then falsely accused of rape nobody actually knows how likely you are to be falsely accused of rape at a minimum percent of rape accusations made to the police are false probably the number is closer to in due to hard forensic evidence of backtested rapekits that excluded the primary suspect as fingered by the alleged victim of the time but we don t really know it s probably safe to say that you are more at risk of being false accused of rape in than at any other time in human history because of the public demonstrations of believewomen many still believe ford s accusations against kavanugh despite being thoroughly discredited by leland keyser i don t have any confidence in the story keyser told new york times reporters robin pogrebin and kate kelly those facts together i don t recollect and it just didn t make any sense keyser told the authors it would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get together with three guys have her leave and then not figure out how she s getting home keyser told pogrebin and kelly i just really didn t have confidence in the story a few days before the hearing keyser s attorney said simply put ms keyser does not know mr kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present with or without dr ford keyser later said she felt pressure by both ford classmate lucy gonella and ford s friend monica mclean to change her story pogrebin and kelly wrote i was told behind the scenes that certain things could spread about me if i didn t comply keyser told the authors amp x b metoo has already been politically weaponized this is ridiculous we are being gaslighted this is bullshit amp x b gt the estimated number of false rape accusations are around at the highest this is a lie on several levels it s and that is a minimum and that s if you only consider surveys conducted by feminists or women s advocates amp x b gt for false rape accusations only named suspects and only got charged that means that only of false rape accusations actually accuse someone and that only of false rape accusations ended up on court i m pretty sure this stat is referring to how many false rape accusers got charged so now you are just making up numbers you are either lying or grossly mistaken amp x b gt vast majority of false rape accusations are made by teenagers parents of children and the homeless there s no way to know this and there is also no citation amp x b gt of false rape accusations are in hopes of getting free medical treatment next major category is from teenagers justifying their absences to parents did i miss the source for this why are you ignoring de zutter amp x b tl dr metoo is a puritanical sexist witchhunt that strips men of due process while refusing to hold women to the same standards as per asia argento katy perry and amber heard it s is a moral panic much like mccarthyism we will look back on metoo with a deep sense of shame for vigilante mob justice conducted in the name of false rape accsusations
5359,i made a crosspost in mensrights to a post from r feminism which had the following text gt alot of the times when i see people talk about male rape or dv victims it s usually in the context of a woman talking about her experience with rape or dv and it s usually like this commentor men face this kind of abuse everyday but society only cares about women gt gt first of all that s not true despite the huge amounts of awareness domestic violence against women is still a problem bisexual women are the group most likely to face domestic violence and women are more likely to experience abuse then men women are also more likely to be sexually abused harassed and even raped then men so that is the primary reason female victims get more awareness and also some time ago people would even encourage men to beat their female partners to keep them in line it is not common to hear someone say that a woman should abuse her male partner to keep them in line so that is the primary reason women victims get more awareness then men still male victims do need help shelter and support and also awareness however i think the biggest problem plaguing them is toxic masculinity according to toxic masculinity men are stronger and smarter then women so they can never be victims but we know better men and women are equal so in a hetero relationship a man can certainly be a victim according to toxic masculinity sex is one of the most valuable thing to a man that a woman can give him so rape is impossible but rape is possible and atleast in men will be raped in their lifetime due to this male victims are often shamed especially by sexist men donald trump and sean hannity once did this to a year old who had been raped by his teacher so in short toxic masculinity harms male victims gt gt but what saddens me is that many people anti feminists and mras especially who dont give a shit about male victims will try to use them as a weapon against feminism or just women in general it s sickening we can help victims of both genders and non binary victims as well without competing to see who is more oppressed i provided a thorough rebuttal with links to sources in the comment of that post but my post was removed by the moderators i assume because it encouraged brigading i have since deleted it since no one else will see it anyway so i ll provide my responses in a post here and i ll neglect to provide the link to the post let s break this feminist s ideas down gt alot of the times when i see people talk about male rape or dv victims it s usually in the context of a woman talking about her experience with rape or dv and it s usually like this commentor men face this kind of abuse everyday but society only cares about women first of all that s not true gt gt despite the huge amounts of awareness domestic violence against women is still a problem bisexual women are the group most likely to face domestic violence and women are more likely to experience abuse then men before you go any further with this the research has shown gender symmetry in domestic violence approximately half of domestic violence is reciprocal violence where both partners abuse each other and women are more likely to initiate this kind of violence and in cases of non reciprocal violence where the violence is unilaterally perpetrated by one partner against the other female violence towards men is actually more common than male violence against women here is the largest set of meta analyses on domestic violence by the partner abuse state of knowledge project pask researchers were asked to conduct a formal search for published peer reviewed studies through standard widely used search programs and then catalogue and summarize all known research studies relevant to each major topic and its sub topics approximately studies were considered and more than were summarized and organized into tables the key findings were among large population samples of ipv reported was bi directional unidirectional of the unidirectional violence was male to female mfpv was female to male fmpv among school and college samples percentage of bidirectional violence was was mfpv and was fmpv and before you say that even though women initiate violence more than men do in relationships that women are still more often the victims of partner violence because their reasons for hitting are different than men s i direct you to these quotes from my source male and female ipv perpetrated from similar motives primarily to get back at a partner for emotionally hurting them because of stress or jealousy to express anger and other feelings that they could not put into words or communicate and to get their partner s attention eight studies directly compared men and women in the power control motive and subjected their findings to statistical analyses three reported no significant gender differences and one had mixed findings one paper found that women were more motivated to perpetrate violence as a result of power control than were men and three found that men were more motivated however gender differences were weak oh and before you say some shit like okay female on male violence may be just as common if not more common than male on female violence but women are still far more likely to be seriously injured by dv yeah no the gender gap regarding harm and injury isn t nearly as big as you seem to think it is iirc there was a study which showed that for every women seriously injured by dv injured seriously enough to require emergency medical attention men are that s not nearly as big a gap as most people assume there are also some studies which show that men are actually more often injured by dv a study called physical aggression in a community sample of at risk young couples gender comparisons for high frequency injury and fear indicated that of men and of women perpetrated frequent physical aggression toward their partners contrary to expectations of men and of women indicated that they were physically injured at least once the authors reported of the men and none of the women indicate that they had been hurt by their partners between five and nine times a study called partner violence and mental health outcomes in a new zealand birth cohort revealed that men and women reported similar rates of injury for women vs for men in the words of the authors the consequences of domestic violence in terms of injury and psychological effects were similar for both men and women furthermore meta analyses have shown that the primary predictor of serious domestic violence injury in women is their own initiation of violence basically you re more likely to be injured as a woman if the man is hitting you back as said earlier a huge amount approximately half of domestic violence is reciprocal and it is more likely to be initiated by women a large percentage of reciprocal violence involves the female partner assaulting and emotionally abusing the male partner until he snaps and reacts violently maybe if we want injury of women to come down we should teach women not to initiate in the first place just a thought gt women are also more likely to be sexually abused harassed and even raped then men so that is the primary reason female victims get more awareness again go look at the data look at the cdc s nisvs in the and reports just as many men reported having been subjected to nonconsensual sexual intercourse in the previous months in the report more men than women reported having been subjected to nonconsensual sexual intercourse in the previous months it may not look immediately obvious because they introduce their reports with findings such as these nisvs nearly in women and in men in the united states have been raped at some time in their lives including completed forced penetration attempted forced penetration or alcohol drug facilitated completed penetration nisvs in the united states an estimated of women and of men have been raped during their lifetimes an estimated of women reported that they were raped in the months preceding the survey the case count for men reporting rape in the preceding months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate however the rape numbers in these studies do not cover all victims of nonconsensual sex they only cover victims who were forcibly penetrated by a perpetrator if a man was forced to penetrate a perpetrator this would not be considered as rape and it would instead fall into a separate category made to penetrate rape is defined as any completed or attempted unwanted vaginal for women oral or anal penetration through the use of physical force such as being pinned or held down or by the use of violence or threats to physically harm and includes times when the victim was drunk high drugged or passed out and unable to consent rape is separated into three types completed forced penetration attempted forced penetration and completed alcohol or drug facilitated penetration among women rape includes vaginal oral or anal penetration by a male using his penis it also includes vaginal or anal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object among men rape includes oral or anal penetration by a male using his penis it also includes anal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object being made to penetrate someone else includes times when the victim was made to or there was an attempt to make them sexually penetrate someone without the victim s consent because the victim was physically forced such as being pinned or held down or by the use of violence or threatened with physical harm or when the victim was drunk high drugged or passed out and unable to consent among women this behavior reflects a female being made to orally penetrate another female s vagina or anus among men being made to penetrate someone else could have occurred in multiple ways being made to vaginally penetrate a female using one s own penis orally penetrating a female s vagina or anus anally penetrating a male or female or being made to receive oral sex from a male or female it also includes female perpetrators attempting to force male victims to penetrate them though it did not happen essentially under the nisvs methodologies a woman drugging and riding a man would not be counted as rape the numbers for men who have been raped only refer to men who were penetrated for example men who have been forced into anal sex or made to perform oral sex on another man and yes situations like these are comparatively rare men being forced to penetrate a perpetrator on the other hand is much more common but it is not included as rape and instead gets considered as made to penetrate made to penetrate falls into the category other sexual violence with other vastly less severe forms of sexual violence and harassment such as non contact unwanted sexual experiences however since the cdc gathered the data for made to penetrate that allows us to make comparisons one year prevalence is considered to be more accurate than lifetime rates because they do not depend on recall of events long past and therefore we will be using these numbers to analyse the and nisvs studies in each of these years when asked about experiences in the last months men reported being made to penetrate either by physical force or due to intoxication at virtually the same rates as women reported rape nisvs showed that in the past months of men or an estimated men were made to penetrate and of women or an estimated women were raped nisvs showed that in the past months of men or an estimated men were made to penetrate and of women or an estimated women were raped nisvs showed that in the past months of men or an estimated men were made to penetrate and of women or an estimated women were raped in each of the years the case count for male rape victims and female victims of made to penetrate were too small to provide a statistically reliable prevalence estimate you can see that the estimated numbers of male victims of made to penetrate each year look very similar to the estimated numbers of female victims of rape so if made to penetrate happens about as often as rape each year then by most people s assumed definition of rape nonconsensual sex then men are approximately half of rape victims each year in of victims of nonconsensual sex in were men in of victims of nonconsensual sex in were men in of victims of nonconsensual sex in were men so if you re a normal human being who defines rape as simply non consensual sex instead of solely forced penetration like the cdc does then men are half of rape victims hmmm gt and also some time ago people would even encourage men to beat their female partners to keep them in line it is not common to hear someone say that a woman should abuse her male partner to keep them in line so that is the primary reason women victims get more awareness then men you really have a skewed view of the past yes in the past men were allowed to use mild correction on their wives under the law as he was socially and legally responsible for the actions of his wife to the extent that he could even be held accountable for the crimes and offences she committed but he could not beat her black and blue men had restrictions on what corporal punishment they could use on their wives in colonial america when men went beyond what was legally acceptable they received punishment through the pillory the pillory was employed for treason sedition arson blasphemy witchcraft perjury wife beating cheating forgery coin clipping dice cogging slandering conjuring fortune telling and drunkenness among other offences on several occasions onlookers pelted the pilloried prisoner so enthusiastically with heavy missiles that death resulted the whipping post also was a favourite form of punishment for wife beating many examples of vigilante justice sometimes lethal enacted against wifebeaters can be found in newspaper clippings from the s and onward with the full endorsement of society we can assume that this was practiced in europe as well likewise americans practiced shivaree and europeans practiced charivari as a way to enable social censure of wife beaters charivari was a historical folk custom expressing public disapproval of personal behaviour where a mock parade was staged through a community accompanied by a discordant mock serenade sometimes the crowd would carry an effigy of the targeted man to a substitute punishment e g burning sometimes the man who physically abused his wife would be abused by the community they would chant old abram higback has been paying his good woman but he neither paid her for what or for why but he up with his fist and blacked her eye now all ye old women and old women kind get together and be in a mind collar him and take him to the shit house and shove him over head now if that does not mend his manners the skin of his arse must go to the tanners and if that does not mend his manners take him and hang him on a nail in hell and if the nail happens to crack down with your flaps and at him piss however if a husband was beaten by his wife the husband in contrast was also the subject of the charivari for essentially allowing it to happen samuel pepys recorded in his diary june in the afternoon took boat and down to greenwich where i find the stairs full of people there being a great riding there to day for a man the constable of the town whose wife beat him a frenchman who traveled in england reported in i have sometimes met in the streets of london a woman carrying a figure of straw representing a man crown d with very ample horns preceded by a drum and followed by a mob making a most grating noise with tongs grid irons frying pans and sauce pans i asked what was the meaning of all this they told me that a woman had given her husband a sound beating for accusing her of making him a cuckold and that upon such occasions some kind neighbour of the poor innocent injur d creature generally performed this ceremony hmmm so while a man could give his wife mild correction under the law if he went too far with wife beating the community would frown down upon him and punish him with the pillory whippings and charivari there was no such extreme social or legal censure for a wife who beat her husband if she beat him he was the one who was punished that doesn t sound at all like what you were saying that wife beating was considered okay and encouraged by the community whereas husband beating was condemned gt still male victims do need help shelter and support and also awareness however i think the biggest problem plaguing them is toxic masculinity according to toxic masculinity men are stronger and smarter then women so they can never be victims but we know better men and women are equal so in a hetero relationship a man can certainly be a victim ahahaha you re kidding right the biggest problem plaguing them is toxic feminism wouldn t you know it it is not toxic men but feminists who have been very happy to paint domestic violence as an offence in which men are the perpetrators and women are the victims the duluth model feminists created the duluth model of domestic violence this model characterises dv as a primarily male perpetrated crime caused by patriarchal terrorism and characterises any dv committed by women as violent resistance towards an abuser it theorises that the reason for this gender disparity is that men are socialised in a patriarchal society that makes them feel entitled to have power dominance and control over women supposedly men who batter are using violence to to maintain their individual and societal patriarchal dominance over women under this faulty model women cannot as a conceptual matter perpetrate partner abuse if they hit their male partners it was in self defence if they hit first or are the only partner who hits they are doing it within the context of violent resistance against presumed emotional or psychological abuse on his part this model by the way is incredibly widely accepted it is the most commonly used model in the world and is the sole model in the majority of us states and across the english speaking west despite the statistical evidence contradicting this feminist narrative in a big way however researchers activists and reformers who produce those results or support the idea of gender symmetry are ostracised and shamed for going against the prevailing narrative such as erin pizzey suzanne steinmetz and murray straus these types of harassment have caused there to be widespread self censorship by people who fear that contradicting the feminist narrative will negatively affect their prospects violence against women act so radical feminists have fought against acknowledgement of male victims and female perpetrators they have pushed a faulty model which characterises domestic violence as a primarily or even uniquely male on female crime and have described it as patriarchal violence even worse they have used this faulty model to justify gender discriminatory legislation the national organisation for women lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal family violence prevention and services act of with the obscenely gendered violence against women act of the passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than passages just because they were male furthermore the department of justice s office on violence against women the principal federal agency that administers vawa funds has issued many directives and established funding mechanisms that are openly discriminatory in nature predominant aggressor policies in the s there was a call for a vigorous law enforcement response to address the issue of dv with mandatory arrest laws being instituted in several states when however it was apparent that these same laws led to a large number of dual arrests and a proportionately greater increase in arrests of women compared to men feminists started calling for primary aggressor or dominant aggressor laws that told police that instead of arresting both parties they should just arrest the primary aggressor in the relationship in determining who the primary aggressor was they prioritised relative height weight strength and patriarchal feminist models of domestic violence duluth again over inconvenient matters such as who is the abusive party they essentially adjusted policy to make outcomes conform to their theory rather than adjusting their theory to conform to reality and the gender ratio in arrests returned to normal male at least of which would ve been victims how nice the resulting injustice against male victims of abuse these feminist reforms have created a lot of social injustice for male victims of domestic violence there are many qualitative studies of male helpseekers who reveal that they are turned away doubted ridiculed by the formal systems in place that are supposed to prevent dv across multiple studies a huge amount of male victims reported being referred to batterers programs when they called domestic violence hotlines or arrested by the police who made the false presumption that the man was the primary aggressor within the judicial system some men who sustained dv reported experiencing gender stereotyped treatment even with apparent corroborating evidence that their female partners were violent and that the helpseekers were not they reportedly lost custody of their children were blocked from seeing their children and were falsely accused by their partners of dv and abusing their children so no it s not toxic men or toxic masculinity that poses the biggest obstacle to male victims of domestic violence it s feminists that have repeatedly consistently minimised female on male abuse said that it s super rare and doesn t happen nearly enough for people to care about it shamed and silenced researchers who dared to demonstrate gender symmetry in domestic violence and used their fucked up worldview to push for law and policy that discriminates against male victims gt but what saddens me is that many people anti feminists and mras especially who dont give a shit about male victims will try to use them as a weapon against feminism or just women in general it s sickening we can help victims of both genders and non binary victims as well without competing to see who is more oppressed you just uh did that in your post you just competed to see who was more oppressed you justified the greater awareness and concern for female victims and relative lack of it for male victims by saying women are more likely to be victims of rape and domestic violence than men when the statistical evidence actually says otherwise anti feminists and mras that say uh actually men are very likely to be abused or raped as well aren t competing to see who is more oppressed and they aren t playing oppression olympics we re objecting to you feminists playing oppression olympics and spreading lies about how women have it so much worse and have always had it so much worse than men to justify unequal treatment when they really don t even if you want to help men you and feminists like you are still lying to us about the nature of the problem about the nature of society both pre and post feminism and about the nature of men and as girlwriteswhat says in this blog post while many would insist that any help even wrongheaded help is better than none that if a feminist believes men are the minority of victims of severe dv still deserve support then we should bring that feminist on board it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth because that is not alliance it s conditional assistance and it is conditional upon them being allowed to go on believing the same lies as before and spreading them and feeding the problem even as they re supposedly trying to solve it and someone who cannot or will not see truth who is lying even when he believes he s telling the truth isn t someone you can trust as far as you can throw him thanks for playing though
5411,myth women weren t allowed to work most documentation from the past heavily implies that people attempted to avoid working as much as possible even so many women did work mostly because they had no choice but to and there has never been a law restricting women from working though creative research has produced evidence of women working at male dominated occupations in the eighteenth century and before there is undoubtedly more documentation out there in newspapers diaries legal proceedings and prints what is more compelling is the lack of documentation that women were not allowed to work most women in poor and middle class families had to work because that was the only way to make enough money to live women have been blacksmiths shoemakers butchers etc apprentice forms for guildwork had spaces left blank to insert he or she though girls who chose this route were usually orphaned and had low prospects for marriage thus they were going to need to work widows could receive the master tradesman status from their husbands and thereby continue the work even take on apprentices to train which suggests that the social assumption was that wives would learn enough about their husband s business and trade to be able to at least continue to oversee it after he died lots of widows continued to run their husbands businesses long after they had died the worshipful company of blacksmiths in london lists sixty five brethren and two sistren in its charter a publication called the tradesman s true guide or a universal directory for the towns of birmingham wolverhampton walsal dudley and the manufacturing village in the neighborhood of birmingham carried exhaustive lists of tradesmen and tradeswomen alphabetically by name and by trade and there are women listed in every trade from butcher to wire drawer in america between the seventeenth and early nineteenth centuries there are records of at least twenty one widows running their late husbands printing businesses mrs jose glover set up shop at harvard massachusetts in after her husband died on a ship from england sarah goddard ran the providence gazette in rhode island learning the business from her brother elizabeth bushell learned from her father and ran the halifax gazette in canada from until jane aitken s father left her his philadelphia printing business in favoring her over her brother who was apparently an idler tippler and little better than a vagrant cut off without a sixpence there were some more prestigious occupations that women historically did not participate in as much but looking at the histories of the first women to enter into medicine law etc show that they hardly faced any resistance in doing so in elizabeth blackwell became the first woman to attend medical school in the us she sent applications for admission to twelve of the most promising institutions in the northern states and her application was accepted by the medical department of geneva university feminist revisionist history explains that she was only admitted to the college by the evil men as a joke but as will be amply demonstrated this is the opposite of what actually happened in fact the student body sent her a letter to welcome her gt at a meeting of the entire medical class of geneva medical college held this day october the following resolutions were unanimously adopted gt gt resolved that one of the radical principles of a republican government is the universal education of both sexes that to every branch of scientific education the door should be open equally to all that the application of elizabeth blackwell to become a member of our class meets our entire approbation and in extending our unanimous invitation we pledge ourselves that no conduct of ours shall cause her to regret her attendance at this institution gt gt resolved that a copy of these proceedings be signed by the chairman and transmitted to elizabeth blackwell she describes this letter as one of her most valued possessions and in her autobiography she states that the men of the college supported her and beyond the behaviour of the medical class during the two years that i was with them was admirable it was that of true christian gentlemen i learned later that some of them had been inclined to think my application for admission a hoax perpetrated at their expense by a rival college but when the bona fide student actually appeared they gave her a manly welcome and fulfilled to the letter the promise contained in their invitation she also notes that the general public also had a favourable view of a woman entering into medicine the admission of a woman for the first time to a complete medical education and full equality in the privileges and the responsibilities of the profession produced a widespread effect in america the public press very generally recorded the event and expressed a favourable opinion of it even in europe some notice of it was taken and punch showed his cordial appreciation by his amusing but friendly verses there are also other examples of women entering into male professions and occupations and encountering little resistance such as the slightly more recent example of arabella mansfield the first female lawyer in the united states although by iowa law the bar exam was restricted to males over arabella mansfield took the exam in passing it with high scores mansfield challenged the state law excluding her and the court ruled that women may not be denied the right to practice law in iowa admitting mansfield to the bar or ada lovelace who was encouraged in her mathematical ability from a young age by her parents and received the best of tutors to increase her ability she was praised by contemporaries for her ability and her work with charles babbage on his analytical machine he too fell into historical obscurity and the analytical engine was unknown to builders of electro mechanical and electronic computing machines in the s and s when they began their work resulting in the need to re invent many of the architectural innovations babbage had proposed he wasn t recognized for what he did until recently and neither was she but that had nothing to do with sexism or murasaki shikibu from japan around the year who listened at the door while her brother received lessons in chinese writing and through that learned it herself she was far from reviled for being a woman who knew chinese and was commissioned by the empress to write the tale of genji a classic work of japanese literature often called the world s first novel oh the o p p r e s s i o n myth marriage was an institution created by men to oppress women men were disproportionately given privilege and power and women were treated like his property in marriage again this is a bastardisation of the past feminism has to stop treating men as the enemy and as the source of all women s and also men s problems they need to realise that things weren t always as they are now and realise that it was not patriarchy or men that restricted the choices of both genders and forced them into strictly defined roles but that these roles came about because it was the best way of arranging societies in the past a past that was much harsher and more unforgiving than it is now a past in which there was more work to do than there were hours in a day a past where men spent most of their short lives working like mules to support themselves and their families and women spent most of their short lives incapacitated by childbirth and child rearing a past in which we sent children into coal mines that ruined their lungs and into factories which lost them limbs things sucked and the reason it was bearable at all back then was because of the gender roles men were not the ones who relegated women to the domestic sphere or kept them dependent on men biology did a woman at that time could not simply strike out on her own and do whatever she wanted for most of history we had no reliable birth control no safe abortion no maternity leave or social security and most public sphere work back then involved hard labour and if you were a woman back then who wanted to be able to have sex then you would have had to plan your life around the idea that you would be getting pregnant giving birth and breastfeeding for most of your adult life and that would have meant you could not be a reliable enough worker to support even yourself let alone a child and it would inherently have made you dependent on other people to help you until the last years or so most women could not have lived a life of children and public sphere work independent of a man and not all can today realistically so in a time when single motherhood was a one way trip to the gutter marriage was a practical arrangement the function of marriage was not to oppress women but to positively assign paternity inasmuch as possible and then obligate the men so assigned to their children and the mothers of their children for life and the reason why we kept it for so long is because it increased the resources which would have been available to offspring providing a healthier environment for children to grow up in when a man married a woman he was legally obligated to feed clothe and shelter her and any children produced in the marriage to the best of his ability unlike what feminists seem to think he could not sell her he could not return her for his money back he could not drop her at the local midden heap he could not destroy her the way he could his actual chattels he could not trade her for a better one he could not legally neglect her just to make things crystal clear here is a summary list of privileges that women enjoyed in marriage and after marriage during the old patriarchal system of the past when a woman married she had to hand over her property to her husband s care again not because she herself was property but because he was administrator of the family but he owed her not just a living but the best living he was financially capable of providing for her a wife was entitled to be maintained by her husband though women did not have the right to enter into contracts in their own name in marriage women had the privilege of the law of agency giving them the legal right to purchase goods on their husbands credit as their agent if the wife racked up debts that the husband couldn t pay she was immune from liability for the debts she racked up that liability fell to the husband instead women had the entitlement of being protected from prosecution for any number of crimes if they could prove their husbands were aware of said crimes in which case he would be prosecuted in her stead not just held as responsible as she was but held solely responsible for her actions this allowed married women to displace accountability for a large number of offences onto their husbands she s out of control and does what she wants regardless of my wishes was not a valid legal defence for those men women were exempt from paying taxes and there was an entire female underground economy of barter and trade that was not subject to taxation or government interference even when married women gained the right to hold property within marriage it was their husbands who were responsible for the taxes owing on it and it was their husbands who were held financially liable for providing all necessaries to the family including the wife even if she made more money than he did after divorce men were held fully financially responsible under the law for the ex wife and kids divorced women were entitled to be supported by their ex husbands to a level commensurate with the husband s for potentially the rest of their lives unless she remarried yeah that doesn t sound at all like women were treated like property to me i m sorry but if i have property i have no legal duty of care toward the actual property i own nor any obligation to commit to own it until death i can sell my property whenever i want i can smash my property on the ground and treat it however i want and it would be my right to do so men could not do any of that to the women they were married to they had obligations towards them to provide for them even after divorce and to protect them even from the consequences of their own actions wives had no such obligation towards their husbands they were entitled to be the ones who were supported because the purpose of marriage in the past was not to oppress women and make them the property of men but to ensure that women and their children could be provided for and protected and to place the responsibility for that provision and protection on the man even at cost to his own wellbeing health and even life this has been the case since time immemorial husbands love your wives just as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her ephesians in fact many of the supposed privileges men had in marriage in the past were to help them carry out their obligations and to prevent them from becoming wholly onerous if a man had an obligation to be accountable for provision for his wife and children it stood to reason that he also should have the entitlement of having control over any assets of his marriage including those his wife brought into the marriage because he was the one who had a responsibility to keep the entire family afloat and to increase their holdings if a man was responsible for the protection of his wife and children to the point where he could be held solely accountable for the actions of his wife whether she contracted debts he couldn t pay or committed a crime he would have to answer for it makes sense why he would be considered head of household and why his family would need to obey him as well as abide by the restrictions he placed on them if upon divorce a man would be held solely responsible for the maintenance of his wife and child it makes sense why he would get custody of the child that he was supporting as well as ownership of assets so he could satisfy that obligation we gave men these rights and privileges because they were the tools that he needed to satisfy his responsibilities and in that way there was a balance women got less because their obligations and accountability were less their responsibility was less men got more because the buck stopped with them whether that buck consisted of a sack of coins or his blood myth men were allowed to beat their wives with impunity this is in an earlier post but it fits here well in the past men were allowed to use mild correction on their wives under the law as he was socially and legally responsible for the actions of his wife to the extent that he could even be held accountable for the crimes and offences she committed but he could not beat her black and blue men had restrictions on what corporal punishment they could use on their wives in colonial america when men went beyond what was legally acceptable they received punishment through the pillory the pillory was employed for treason sedition arson blasphemy witchcraft perjury wife beating cheating forgery coin clipping dice cogging slandering conjuring fortune telling and drunkenness among other offences on several occasions onlookers pelted the pilloried prisoner so enthusiastically with heavy missiles that death resulted the whipping post also was a favourite form of punishment for wife beating many examples of vigilante justice sometimes lethal enacted against wifebeaters can be found in newspaper clippings from the s and onward with the full endorsement of society we can assume that this was practiced in europe as well likewise americans practiced shivaree and europeans practiced charivari as a way to enable social censure of wife beaters charivari was a historical folk custom expressing public disapproval of personal behaviour where a mock parade was staged through a community accompanied by a discordant mock serenade sometimes the crowd would carry an effigy of the targeted man to a substitute punishment e g burning sometimes the man who physically abused his wife would be abused by the community they would chant old abram higback has been paying his good woman but he neither paid her for what or for why but he up with his fist and blacked her eye now all ye old women and old women kind get together and be in a mind collar him and take him to the shit house and shove him over head now if that does not mend his manners the skin of his arse must go to the tanners and if that does not mend his manners take him and hang him on a nail in hell and if the nail happens to crack down with your flaps and at him piss however if a husband was beaten by his wife the husband in contrast was also the subject of the charivari for essentially allowing it to happen in france about husbands beaten by their wives were paraded on an ass face to tail in england a mural in montacute house constructed about shows a wife beating her husband with a shoe and then a crowd parading the husband on a cowlstaff samuel pepys recorded in his diary june in the afternoon took boat and down to greenwich where i find the stairs full of people there being a great riding there to day for a man the constable of the town whose wife beat him a frenchman who traveled in england reported in i have sometimes met in the streets of london a woman carrying a figure of straw representing a man crown d with very ample horns preceded by a drum and followed by a mob making a most grating noise with tongs grid irons frying pans and sauce pans i asked what was the meaning of all this they told me that a woman had given her husband a sound beating for accusing her of making him a cuckold and that upon such occasions some kind neighbour of the poor innocent injur d creature generally performed this ceremony hmmm so while a man could give his wife mild correction under the law if he went too far with wife beating the community would frown down upon him and punish him with the pillory whippings and charivari there was no such extreme social or legal censure for a wife who beat her husband if she beat him he was the one who was punished myth husbands were owed sex with their wives marital rape was not illegal and marriage as an institution was based around rape of women the idea at the time was that there could not be such a thing as marital rape because as a married person you are owed sex from your spouse i e conjugal rights this applied to both men and women people who believe that conjugal rights allowed husbands to rape wives and not the other way around haven t actually done any research it was based on the idea that both parties had a right to sex in the relationship and this was exercisable in law by each partner in a marriage the bible essentially said it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless because of sexual immorality let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband let the husband render to his wife the affection due her and likewise also the wife to her husband the wife does not have authority over her own body but the husband does and likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does do not deprive one another except with consent for a time that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again so that satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self control do note the specific passage where it says the wife does not have authority over her own body but the husband does and likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does and here s a quote from an article detailing the history of sex and marriage a hundred years ago or so if you took the statute books literally the only people entitled to have sex with each other were people who were legally married all other sex was against the law fornication sex with unmarried people was illegal so was adultery sex with a married person but not the person you yourself were married to cohabitation living with someone in a sexual relationship was against the law except for people who were legally married enforcement was shall we say something less than perfect at times it was almost nonexistent and the rules were riddled with exceptions sodomy on the other hand was quite a serious crime and the full weight of the law sometimes came down heavily on people who had gay or lesbian sex married people were not only entitled to have sex they were in a way required to have sex of course nobody checked on whether john and mary were having sex every night or once a week or once a month or never but if either john or mary did not perform at all for whatever reason the frustrated partner had grounds for divorce or even perhaps an annulment so what does this show it shows that both parties had an obligation to provide the other partner with sex during the marriage and could not deprive their spouse of it if it was an issue it was not an issue that solely affected women myth men had the vote and women did not women s suffrage was a matter of women as a united group fighting for their rights against a rotten male establishment that kept it from them really i m very tired of hearing this one in britain the right to vote was not only restricted by gender but also by class property owners had the vote the vast majority of men did not in just of the population had the right to vote during this time there were a few groups who were fighting for the vote to be extended to them and one of these groups were the chartists who were active from to they were fighting for broad electoral reforms including a vote for all men over the secret ballot no property qualification to become an mp payment for mps electoral districts of equal size annual elections for parliament they presented three huge demonstrations to parliament and their requests were denied every time the restrictions were relaxed but not abolished benjamin disraeli said when introducing the second reform act of we do not live and i trust it will never be the fate of this country to live under a democracy the propositions which i am going to make tonight certainly have no tendency in that direction there were also the suffragists and the suffragettes who were fighting for the vote to be extended to women suffragists emerged in the mid th century and believed in peaceful constitutional campaign methods in the early th century after the suffragists failed to make significant progress a new generation of activists emerged these women became known as the suffragettes and they were willing to take direct militant action for the cause unfortunately for these groups a huge amount of women disagreed with their cause so many women objected to the franchise being imposed on them that in the mere months leading up to a parliamentary debate on women s suffrage anti suffragettes had managed to collect signatures from women who objected to the franchise being imposed on them meanwhile in the years leading up to that debate suffragettes only managed to collect signatures of women who wanted the vote a segment from the transcript of the debate still for what it is worth one finds that from only women signed petitions to this house in favour of female suffrage and that during the last eighteen months a period in which a strong anti suffrage association has been in existence women some of them eminent women have signed petitions against it and to the effect that these proposals shall not be forced upon them and a rather interesting illustration was furnished by an inquiry which was instituted by the sheffield independent a newspaper which i think itself is sympathetic with these proposals this inquiry was addressed to the women householders of sheffield twenty three thousand papers were sent out and of the replies were in favour of woman suffrage and were against it the representatives of this paper reported that in many cases their emissaries were chased with violence from the houses by the female inhabitants under the impression that they were collecting statistical matter as the emissaries of the suffragist party it might be difficult for you today to understand why so many women would reject the vote so vehemently but this was an era where full citizenship rights like the right to vote were granted only to those with citizenship responsibilities and sometimes not even then in that historical context the vote was actually viewed not just as a right but also an obligation regardless of the lack of support for women s suffrage among women suffragettes became extremely militant in their activism in emmeline pankhurst founded the women s social and political union wspu with her daughters christabel and sylvia and the wspu carried out a nationwide bombing and arson campaign between and hundreds of bombs were left on trains in theatres post offices churches even outside the bank of england while arson attacks on timber yards railway stations and private houses inflicted an untold amount of damage instead of being beneficial in supporting the vote for women it was disastrous lloyd george said the action of the militants is ruinous the feeling amongst the sympathisers of the cause in the house is one of panic i am frankly not very hopeful of success if these tactics are persisted in terrorism aside emmeline pankhurst was also resistant to acquiring the vote for working class men realising that this would be much tougher than winning the vote for respectable aka upper class women and underlying the resistance appears to have been her contempt for working class men according to sean lang in his book on parliamentary reform the pankhursts became stridently anti male ruthlessly dropping even the most loyal of their male supporters from the wspu and claiming as christabel did in her book the great scourge that men were little more than carriers of venereal disease when ww came around in suffragettes also threw their support behind the white feather campaign with the aim of shaming men into enlisting those young women went in for the kill striking men at the very heart of their masculine identities the bestowing of a feather telling them if you don t go off to be maimed or die you are no longer a man in the eyes of some brassy chit you ve never even met before and will probably never see again and many men went because a woman s censure any woman s censure had the power to drive them straight into the teeth of death by mid though it was clear that not enough men were signing up to replace the fatalities on the front line and the military service act was introduced in january by march compulsory conscription for all single men aged was in place in may the act was extended to include conscription for married men it was only at that point that the british government considered extending the vote to all men as most of the propertyless working class men that were conscripted into war during ww did not have the right to vote and this was finally starting to be seen as the injustice that it was in the trenches class divisions were eroded to the extent that class no longer had any real meaning and every man was the equal of each other in terms of sacrifice and service to one s country men got universal suffrage at the same time as women finally got the vote in with the representation of the people act which is most famous for having brought more than eight million women over into the electorate but which also enfranchised more than five million men over the age of without regard to property or class the age restriction on women was considered a temporary necessity because so many men had died in wwi that including all women over would have turned women into a supermajority voting bloc and just ten years later the act the act which gave women electoral equality gave the vote to women at age regardless of any property qualification which added another five million women to the electorate introducing the bill the home secretary george cave said war by all classes of our countrymen has brought us nearer together has opened men s eyes and removed misunderstandings on all sides it has made it i think impossible that ever again at all events in the lifetime of the present generation there should be a revival of the old class feeling which was responsible for so much and among other things for the exclusion for a period of so many of our population from the class of electors i think i need say no more to justify this extension of the franchise the act was achieved not by the suffragettes terrorist tactics but by fighting of men in ww when thousands of men from their many different backgrounds came together to fight the common enemy this finally achieved what the chartists the levellers and the peasants before them had struggled for in terms of eroding barriers of class without the sacrifice of men who endured the horror of trench warfare in ww class barriers would have persisted and the vote would have been extended only to elite wealthy propertied women in a later study of attitudes to conscription in one woman responded in the last war ww i never told one man that he ought to go i tried to put myself in their place if i d been them i wouldn t have gone when i saw them going through the streets all the young men i used to think that they were being driven like cattle to the slaughter house and they were weren t they fodder for the guns the common idea that all men had the vote and that women did not and that women s suffrage was a fight of women who were united against men working as an oppressive force to keep them down is an affront to these men who died in a literal war that secured universal suffrage for everyone it also ignores and erases the will and sentiment of many many many anti suffragette women who actively rejected the vote and protested vehemently against it being imposed on them furthermore the view that suffragettes were a valiant fair minded equality oriented group who got women the vote and whose activism merely amounted to firecrackers in barrels is an affront to any right thinking person the real violence and extremism of the suffragettes are barely if at all recognised by the general public and this is partly due to attempts by suffragettes to sanitise their history laura e nym mayhall in her work on the militant suffrage movement identified the importance of a small group of former suffragettes in the s and s who created a highly stylised story of the wspu and the history of suffrage in england which emphasised women s martyrdom and passivity the group set about compiling the documents memoirs and memorabilia that now form the basis of the suffragette fellowship collection held by the museum of london and here we are now in crazy world where the suffragettes are praised for their brave activism when their actions were actually violent destructive hateful and egregiously detrimental to the cause of women s suffrage and men of the past are roundly condemned as being an oppressive force who never had to fight for their rights when in reality it was men s sacrifice in ww that caused class divisions to be eroded enough in order for universal suffrage to be afforded to both men and women
5485,so ummm hi
6077,so this is going to be a long one which i hope you all enjoy i have no idea if people will be interested i ve also linked a couple of studies here in the past that will be included as part of this essay a few points before we begin i by no means claim a monopoly on truth i am just going from my understanding and personal perspectives i am not and will ever be a proponent of stereotyping any individual these are a reflection of the potential differences based off of biological influences they are not absolute but statistical averages and may in fact be due to socialisation but i am of the opinion that this is too narrow to apply on an epistemological level i will explore this later in the post i think discrimination definitely exists and we should be mindful to call it out when it happens but discrepencies in outcomes may have other factors that are more significant than mere discrimination and i am not convinced you can use these to measure discrimination at face value in fact i believe it is potentially dangerous socialisation definitely has an impact but this doesn t mean that biology doesn t and that s why i am focusing on this today i think nurture can interrupt or counteract biology but i don t think this is an absolute and i think every individual is different as to what nurture cues they will react to positively or negatively let s begin the great nature vs nurture debate so many people who have followed this topic may be aware of this study by gijsbert stoet and david c geary which seemingly measured how women in stem decreased in countries with more gender equality this is despite the fact that gt using an international database on adolescent achievement in science mathematics and reading n we showed that girls performed similarly to or better than boys in science in two of every three countries and in nearly all countries more girls appeared capable of college level stem study than had enrolled the conclusions were as follows gt one of the main findings of this study is that paradoxically countries with lower levels of gender equality had relatively more women among stem graduates than did more gender equal countries this is a paradox because gender equal countries are those that give girls and women more educational and empowerment opportunities and that generally promote girls and women s engagement in stem fields this has recently been come under notable critique and subsequent defense of the study by the original authors gt critique gt gt the case of algeria highlights a central point of contention in algeria percent of stem graduates are women still only percent of women college graduates choose a degree in stem compared with percent of men stoet and geary had claimed that they were reporting the percent number but they were actually focusing on the statistic that men were receiving degrees in stem at a higher rate gt gt in their revised paper stoet and geary maintain that there is a gender paradox in stem but clarify that it relates to their more obscure measure which they termed the propensity of women and men to attain a higher degree in stem gt gt response gt gt we agree that there are different ways to express the proportion of women who choose stem degrees in our view it is important to control for differences in the overall number of women and men who attend college which varies from nation to nation accordingly in our original article stoet amp geary we chose a calculation method that adjusts for this potential confound gt gt algeria provides a good example of such a confound where of all stem graduates are women at face value algeria has established gender parity in stem graduates however the absolute percentage does not tell us about the sex difference in the propensity to pursue stem when we consider that of all algerian college students are women richardson et al of all algerian women graduating from college pursued a degree in a stem field compared with of men thus absolute parity is achieved only because there are many more women than men in college we are interested in the propensity of women and men to choose stem and therefore use a calculation that provides the percentage of women among stem graduates when the total numbers of women and men in college would be equal gt gt that said our specific approach has no bearing on the conclusions even taking the absolute percentage of women stem graduates among all stem graduates e g in algeria we still find the same negative correlation between women in stem and the global gender gap index gggi rs p compared with rs p lt in stoet amp geary p the next critique is based off of the fact that stoet and geary have recently created a new metric for potentially measuring gender inequality bigi introducing areas where men might fall behind women but aren t included as part of other scales global gender gap index gggi using new metrics that they consider relevant to all men and women in any society healthy life expectancy years expected to live in good health basic education literacy and years of primary and secondary education life satisfaction so the critique is as follows gt critique gt gt in any case all nation level gender equality measures are highly imperfect for understanding the drivers of gender equality stoet and geary naively adopt the gggi as a social science measure of gender equality but it was not designed for that purpose and it should not be used as a measure of gender empowerment or attitudes about gender for example rwanda ranked sixth in the world on the gggi due to high representation of women in economic and political life this outstanding representation stemmed from rwanda s post genocide sex ratio imbalance not a campaign to increase women s empowerment similarly a negative correlation between stem degrees and gggi rank in a particular country say luxembourg tells us nothing about whether gender equality is causally related to stem achievement or a product of other factors such as coeducational opportunities on offer for higher education in stem in that locality gt gt response gt gt further we agree with richardson and colleagues that our recently published basic index of gender inequality bigi stoet amp geary does not correlate with the stem graduation gap unlike the gggi the bigi provides a simplified measure of sex differences in well being but does not focus on women s empowerment e g participation in politics or the labor force we believe that there is no theoretical reason to expect a relation between bigi scores and the propensity of women to pursue stem degrees gt gt with respect to the issue of how much an international indicator such as the gggi can tell us about sex differences we note that the gggi is frequently used in the psychological and social sciences and that it is the only annually reported independent gender gap index this is all very much a back and forth and by itself doesn t tell us anything there is one more critique not included in the document i sourced but i found it too interesting to exclude as part of a debate on reddit gt in developing countries entering a stem field is far more lucrative for a woman than for a woman in the developed world perhaps as gender equality increases non stem fields become more of a viable option for women so it is not necessarily based on preferences but rather on economic incentive to which i replied gt but the removal of economic incentive could give women more freedom to decide their futures based on their preferences so when other fields become more viable they choose to go into the fields most suited to their preferences i just don t think your point inherently contradicts the points others have made and will also raise the final point by stoet and geary in their defense gt moreover the gender equality paradox is consistent with a much broader literature in which sex differences for many traits are larger in more egalitarian countries so why is this argument happening and what does the broader literature say what is the limit of this broader literature i ll attempt to explore all of this stay tuned the broader literature and the limits so what is this literature there s certainly some referenced in the response but i would be more inclined to include my own at this point i haven t checked if there s any overlap with the literature in the document and this is going to be more of a source dump so consider yourself warned i m trying to stay within the character limit afterall braaaiiins so let s start with the biological studies do men and women have different brains on average and what could this mean well there s a few studies that say no for instance joel et al came to this conclusion gt these findings are corroborated by a similar analysis of personality traits attitudes interests and behaviors of more than individuals which reveals that internal consistency is extremely rare our study demonstrates that although there are sex gender differences in the brain human brains do not belong to one of two distinct categories male brain female brain but there is a magnitude of studies that suggest otherwise and i don t think this is an exhaustive list lotze et al gt the current study compared sex differences in the brain examining gray matter volume in two independent cohorts we found a high reproducibility of effects between cohorts and therefore pooled the data for a unified analysis anderson et al gt as expected our results demonstrate that sexual dimorphism in brain structure is highly apparent among incarcerated samples and the multivariate methods used to quantify gray matter allowed greater than accuracy in classifying individuals as male or female and sexual differences in brain sturcture highly correlate with transexualism as referenced by krujver et al gt differences among the groups were statistically significant by the nonparametric kruskal wallis multiple comparison test and as linked the other day this extensive study by wierenega et al gt the present study included a large lifespan sample and robustly confirmed previous findings of greater male variance in brain structure in humans even if we took the intial data by joel et al other experts have come to wildly different conclusions like chekroud et al for instance gt despite the absence of dimorphic differences and lack of internal consistency observed by joel et al multivariate analyses of whole brain patterns in brain morphometry can reliably discriminate sex these two results are not mutually inconsistent we wholly agree that a strict dichotomy between male female brains does not exist but this does not diminish or negate the importance of considering statistical differences between the sexes e g including sex as a covariate in morphometric analyses differences across cultures it is hard to measure the impact of these differences however just as we know that testosterone influences behaviour but not necessarily in ways we expect and it is not the only thing that determines behaviour so it is with average brain differences and their impact on men and women who s to say if we go by hydes hypothesis she concluded gt it is time to consider the costs of overinflated claims of gender differences arguably they cause harm in numerous realms including women s opportunities in the workplace couple conflict and communication and analyses of selfesteem problems among adolescents most important these claims are not consistent with the scientific data there are some indications to the contrary though for instance this study by osmo kontula conducted across european countries found gt differences in sexual desire and values came out in many ways also in the sexual experiences that men and women had had even though differences in the number of sexual partners had declined men continued to report a greater number of sex partners in their lifetime as well as more partners within the last several years compared with women men were also more likely to enter into parallel relationships alongside their current relationship and had had more such relationships than women or this study by giudice et al in direct contradiction to hyde s conclusion gt the idea that there are only minor differences between the personality profiles of males and females should be rejected as based on inadequate methodology found gt the results were striking the effect size for global sex differences in personality was d an extremely large effect by any psychological standard corresponding to a overlap between the male and female distributions assuming normality even removing the variable with the largest univariate effect size sensitivity the multivariate effect was d overlap assuming normality these effect sizes firmly place personality in the same category of other psychological constructs showing large robust sex differences such as aggression and vocational gt gt interests giola et al gt sex differences in personality are larger in more gender equal countries this surprising finding has consistently been found in research examining cross country differences in personality schmitt et al gt even so important gender differences in personality exist that likely stem at least in part from evolved psychological adaptations some of these adaptations generate culturally universal gender differences and many are further designed to be sensitive to local socioecological contexts in ways that facultatively generate varying sizes of gender differences across cultures costa et al gt the present results extend to a wider range of cultures and a broader selection of personality traits conclusions reached by feingold in his review of gender differences in personality in brief gender differences are modest in magnitude consistent with gender stereotypes and replicable across cultures weisberg et al suggesting sex differences although as previously mentioned these can not be assessd on an individual level in terms of societal trends who knows gt replicating previous findings women reported higher big five extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism scores than men however more extensive gender differences were found at the level of the aspects my favourite study along these line by lee ellis is one that takes hydes findings and comes to a new hypothesis known as the evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory gt while hyde s concept can be applied to most sex differences it should not obscure the fact that several effect sizes have been shown to far exceed these include for mental rotation for throwing accuracy for toleration of casual sex oliver amp hyde for desired number of sex partners for mechanical reasoning and for interest in objects versus people the extreme specificity of ena theory makes it highly vulnerable to disproof sex hormones especially testosterone must be affecting brain functioning in at least two ways one involving suboptimal arousal in and around the reticular formation and the other having to do with the functional balance between the two hemispheres one or both of these two brain functioning patterns should be responsible for most of the average universal sex difference in cognition and behavior that are documented all the remaining universal sex differences should be attributable to evolutionary genetic factors or some combination of neurohormonal and evolutionary genetic factors culturally based learning should never be powerful enough to completely suppress these biological forces gt gt this article was written with two goals in mind the first was to document that there are many sex differences in cognition and behavior that now appear to be universal second the article identifies three theoretical explanations that have been offered so far for universal sex differences the founder effect theory of faustosterling the social structuralist theory of eagly and wood and the evolutionary theory of buss and schmitt geary and okami and shackelford none of these theories seem to explain most of the ausds herein identified ena theory offers a new explanation for universal sex differences primarily by adding specific proximate elements to a few evolutionary genetic assumptions in the broadest terms ena theory has two evolutionary genetic components and two neurological endocrinological components my final thought on this would be that we probably don t have enough information to reliably discern nurture from nature although there are consistent indications across the world while similarities are greater than the differences that doesn t mean our differences don t have an impact on the general shaping of gendered trends across society the way i would frame it is this men and women are mainly the same we all have skin we have two eyes and olfactory sensors our bodies have more similarites than differences but the differences make a difference men and women have different skin which could influence why women are more interested in skin care products or how women have better senses of smell which could influence why boys tend to be more smelly or how men have vision better suited for motion tracking and women for distinguishing colours or the elephant in the room woman s ability to get pregnant again these aren t applicable to any one individual sex apart the pregnancy but the general trends are still there i see brain differences in much the same way and think it s only logical that they would be different foetal development differences in foetal development which makes culture even less likely wheelock et al gt we discovered both within and between network fc ga associations that varied with sex specifically associations between ga and posterior cingulate temporal pole and fronto cerebellar fc were observed in females only whereas the association between ga and increased intracerebellar fc was stronger in males these observations confirm that sexual dimorphism in functional brain systems emerges during human gestation and by baron cohen et al two studies gt in conclusion we report the first direct evidence that steroidogenic activity is elevated in fetal development of those who later receive diagnoses on the autism spectrum these results raise new questions for understanding a wide array of other observations about the early development of autism through their interactions with early fetal steroidogenic abnormalities and provide initial support for the importance of fetal steroid hormones as important epigenetic fetal programming mechanisms for autism and by melissa hines gt convergent data from studies of individuals with genetic disorders such as cah or cais offspring of pregnancies where women were treated with medications that influence testosterone and studies relating normal variability in prenatal testosterone to postnatal behaviour all suggest that levels of prenatal testosterone predict levels of sex typed postnatal childhood play behaviour and cohen bendahan et al while this study didn t replicate findings of other studies it does demonstrate differences in aggression linked to prenatal testosterone and was done on twins so prenatal testosterone is not the only influence of gendered behaviour though i think with the other studies we have some pretty robust findings gt testosterone was higher in boys than girls but similar in os and ss twin girls testosterone was not in any way systematically related to the different personality traits however a sex difference in aggression proneness was observed and os girls showed a more masculine pattern of aggression proneness than the ss girls it is argued that it is unlikely that this difference is due to social factors such as a gender specific upbringing in tribal communities it s hard to find relevant studies on this as this is more exploring the tribal societies weren t like this argument but there is evidence to suggest that women wanting a provider has historical context before the currently theorised patriarchal society developed gt nature is a harsh taskmaster but so it seems is human culture although the popular notion is that farming and settlement cushioned people against survival of the fittest this study shows that s not true something cultural happened years ago that s marked us even today while hunter gatherer tribes are more egaltarian tasks are still seperated between gendered lines so suggest research by coren et al gt while we find no sex difference in willingness to compete in the female centric task we find that men are more likely to compete in the male centric task while further work is needed this study lends some support to the idea of a sex difference in willingness to compete among hunter gatherers but it also highlights the importance of the task type the observation that a sizable proportion of male hadza choose to compete in each of the tasks is discussed in light of the fact that hunter gatherers are largely egalitarian and non hierarchical upper body strength predicts reproductive success coren et al gt these findings suggest that selection for hunting ability may have acted on men s upper bodies nevertheless the importance of effort on strength and hunting success cannot be dismissed this is also discussed gurven et al found that the most prestigious hunters gave the best food to their families gt many studies report biased distributions preferential shares to acquirers and their families or more frequent sharing to close kin outside the nuclear family there are multiple books which support this as well full disclosue i have only read excerpts and second hand critiques schmitt d p the evolution of culturally variable sex differences men and

psychological science conclusion and the great debate this would usually be the moment where someone would ascribe some sort of percentage or state whether nature or nurture influences behaviour more my tentative answer is bugger off with these lines of reasoning our knowledge is limited and as a layperson on the internet who may well be an expert i am not my opinion is both the combination of nature and nurture that makes up our personalities are so interlinked that they can not with our current knowledge be adequately distinguished i think that whether nature or nurture has more of an impact would depend fully on the individual and maybe even individual traits will be influenced to different degress by both some people may well be more biologically predisposed to react to sociological factors with some individual traits possibly being more likely to do with nature but that doesn t mean these same traits can t develop through nurture as well nature and nurture can both have an influence on how the brain develops we are floundering about in the dark looking for answers that don t really exist staing both is not only fair but the least controversial stance to take robust evidence exists for both conclusions however this does likely mean that a one size fits all to socialisation will not succeed and throws a wrench into the flawed concept of social construction theory we can not ignore the potential impacts of biology just as we can not ignore the potential impacts of socialisation if only for the reason that we are all likely wrong in our assertions in some ways a top down control seems like a bad idea i come to a point where i ask the question with an already predermined answer why is this such a controversial subject my tentative answer comes to a couple of factors for one biological arguments have been used to restrict people in the past it s difficult to broach this subject without some accusation of biological determinism i don t believe this is the same thing but i can see why other s might my argument is not to arbitarily block people and not to be used to prescribe attributes to any one individual my argument is descriptive it is to say that even if we removed all barriers to success along gendered lines we would still likely see disparate outcomes i don t know if this can be changed which would make efforts at parity useless at best and dangeours at worst this may be hyperbolic but i don t think so i m not sure arguing social determinism is any better than arguing biological determinism but there s the rub we have a theory dominant in certain fields of academia that is hard to get away from i will conclude with the words of a social scientist working in the field heather metcalf gt the context of much stem workforce research is its reliance on a flawed linear model that views students and workers as passive flows through leaky pipes and its focus on numeric diversity at best overall the stem workforce studies reviewed highlight the complicated and often problematic ways in which discourse and survey research meet they speak to the limitations of survey definitions particularly those used to measure identity characteristics family stem fields and degrees and educational and career pathways and success these studies also illustrate the importance of appropriately balancing disaggregating data by gender race class nationality citizenship status field and sector while considering interactions among these measures this review indicates the need to critically consider claims both in the popular and scientific press about workforce shortages and desired demographics and the pervasive influences these claims have on workforce studies and policies so that s one idiot s opinion what do y all think wasn t sure what flair to use so i went with feminism as it flies in the face of popular academy feminist theory

8536,was the decision to force men into attritional warfare in the first world war a deliberate mass cull by the ruling classes of able bodied men at the time when they threatened most to revolt against their governments if not what explains the extraordinary and continuous orders for men to die on the western and eastern fronts if so what does it say that after a century these mass genocidalists have had to answer to no one and today s ruling classes know that they are free from any retribution if and when they attempt the same the means there is an extremely crucial distinction between volunteers and conscripts and that is certainly the case in the first and the second world wars it is still the case today if a man dies or suffers in a lethal situation that he has volunteered to be in you can say he took a risk and he took the consequences it resembles suicide once in though they can be forced to do basically anything by their commanding officers once you are in you cannot get out so of course there are grey areas if however a man dies or suffers in a lethal situation that he has been forced into then that casualty or death is not the same as for a volunteer if it is a death it is murder and the murderer is the government who knowingly forced that man into a life threatening situation this is the case of conscription when we multiply that murder or grevious bodily harm by the number of these men conscripts who were forced against their will into the killing fields of the first and the second world wars we have the greatest murder crime in history it is the mass murder of millions of men and further when we see who were forced exclusively men it is now a mass genocide on top of that those of the lower classes were most at risk and most numerous among conscripts essentially the oppressed younger men that were threatening to destroy the ruling classes in russia britain france and germany were destroyed by the ruling classes in russia britain france and germany the motive at the time of the first world war there was growing dissent in the major countries involved by the male lower classes a new class of urban factory workers who laboured under hazardous conditions emerged from the industrial revolution angry at those who kept them impoverished and often seeking work they started for the first time to conglomerate in the major cities where they met other men who found common ground in their deprivation and anger at the ruling class in clemenceau s french government ordered troops to open fire on anarcho syndicalist general confederation of labour strikers his later president would be poincar who was seen especially in the english speaking world as an aggressive figure who had helped to cause the war in one of the two main issues in the spring of was maintaining the year conscription of french males the period from to was marked by labour unrest including strikes in britain and ireland the british socialist party was founded in the bolsheviks in russia formed their own party in and the concept of class struggle was brought to a new level at that time and was reported in the international press two years later amid growing class tensions jean jaures a prominent socialist and anti war leader in france who opposed the war mad emile driant and his conscription law was assassinated in july the first world war started and the lower class males who could threaten to revolt were sent to their deaths by the governments who were scared of that possibility sure enough the same men who were targeted those who survived and still had the use of their bodies went on to revolt against their rulers in both russia and germany and to resist conscription in all other countries the french revolted in the french army mutinees of the wwi killing machine was the main cause of the russian revolution and the german revolution in britain there was none and that shows greatly in the fascism of that country s governments and laws and state propaganda virtually ever since when considered in this light the killing fields fulfill all the criteria for mass genocide a targeted demographic section of the population millions of murders a resultant population shortage the man shortage forcing the target demographic into the killing zone a political interestcan we identify more specific patterns that might point to particular perpetrators as it happens yes those who pushed for the legislation that forced conscription on the male populace for one and of course those giving the orders of battle today i address the top authorities on the field and the most complicit of their leaders the opportunity the following are the worst battles by casualties of the first world war except for three of them and cambrai with casualties all of the following battles inflicted casualties of over men each in some cases the count was three to four hundred thousand in some over half a million and in a few cases a million or more casualties were suffered serbian campaign the frontiers tannenberg galicia the marne the aisne ypres i lodz champagne i sarikamish masurian lakes ii ypres ii gallipoli artois ii champagne ii and artois iii gorlice tarnow the great retreat serbian campaign erzurum verdun asiago brusilov offensive the somme monastir romanian campaign nivelle offensive the aisne ii arras messines the isonzo x ypres iii the isonzo xi caporetto cambrai spring ludendorff offensive michael ypres iv the aisne iii gneisenau the piave ii the marne ii the hundred days offensive i wondered what we can learn from lessons given at such a price my interest then was who exactly was most responsible for these mass murders we know that figures in the german french british and russian governments were then it occured to me that if the gigantic amount of casualties was simply because that s war for you then there doesn t seem to be much reason for any pattern to emerge in these disasters except that when i analysed them just on two measures alone that s not what i found the two measures were casualty count over men battle commander s of course any battle with casualties especially such a high count as or is a tragedy worth looking into but i used a limit of roughly casualties i focused on four ruling regimes the british the russian the german and the french heirarchies as it happens all of the highest casualty battles of the first world war involved at least one of these regimes as far as i can discern the next step and admittedly the choice of this number was somewhat arbitrary was to find those battles in which one of these four nationalities lost a hundred thousand or more men just from that single country alone and just to clarify yes these are mindblowing numbers such was the lack of concern for the men on the front lines one would think that repeatedly losing so many of ones own valuable heroes would be strongly avoided if a commander inflicted casualties on his own men surely he would be disciplined and would hopefully never lead a major battle again i then looked into who specifically has been attributed leadership of these atrocities was there a particular officer of one of these four rulerships that commanded more than one battle where he was responsible for the deaths and injuries of of the men taking his orders i hope today on the th day of the th month on the nd anniversary of the cesassion of the violence to start with one of the four core nations and whether there were any patterns in who caused the most casualties and if so who they were and what they were about france continuing with this method we will see if the french heirarchy had any odd reccurances of leaders responsible for repeated mass killings if any are identified we will look closer at their behaviour and see if there is any correlation with their attitudes or behaviour towards their soldiers the proletariat the underclass the bolsheviks or other revolutionaries trying to fight the system note the length of this report will be determined by my findings at the general rank level for most cases there may be many more suspects at the equivalent levels of brigadier colonel major captain and indeed lieutenant battles with approx casualties under the french command and the battle commanders first battle of the marne joseph joffre joseph gallieni michael joseph maunoury louis franchet d esperey ferdinand foch fernand de langle de cary phillipe petain maurice sarrail second battle of the marne casualties ferdinand foch paul andre maistre antoine de mitry marie emile fayolle charles mangin henri gouraud the nivelle offensive robert nivelle the battle of the somme joffre foch fayolle joseph alfred micheler battles with approx casualties under the french command and the battle commanders the battle of verdun joffre noel de castelnau de cary frederic georges herr petain nivelle adolphe guillaumat auguste hirschauer mangin passchendaele the third battle of ypres francois anthoine the spring offensive foch petain the hundred days offensive foch petain these are some figures that hold the key to whether conscription was used to instigate a class and gender mass genocide in this case in france and as it has not been recognised as such yet to see if todays governments can get away with the same thing with just as little consequence amp x b the suspects amp x b clemenceau the only name not on the above list due to his civilian status as political ruler it was clemenceau s lobbying that pushed the issue of increasing conscription from two to three years in france clemenceau hated the cause of the lower classes he reorganised the french police forces and ordered repressive policies towards the workers movement after a mine disaster that killed over a thousand miners clemenceau ordered the military against the strikers and repressed the wine growers strike too he declared as the enemy of the french section of the workers international led by jean jaures jaures was a threat to clemenceau and his allies for his popularity with and ability to mobilise the lower classes and his strong opposition to conscription of french males jaures position on the beseiged wine growers was telling them in the vat of the republic prepare the wine of the social revolution the government shot these striking protesters clemenceau s position on lethal violence against the male lower classes in his country was clear to see for example when he ordered troops to open fire on anarcho syndicalist general confederation of labour strikers jaures however took a mostly reconcilliatory approach positioning himself as the mediator and rational uniter of different areas of ideology and also of different major countries he was due to go to another international conference to diffuse the buildup to war when on july st he was assassinated more or less as soon as he was out of the way the next day the french government announced their mobilisation and three days later the first world war commenced for militants like clemenceau although now out of government the peacemaker was out of the way as soon as the war started clemenceau advised the interior minister malvy to arrest a list of known and suspected subversives when he took control of the country again in he instigated a crackdown on those who opposed him citing that they were a threat to national security his close and long term sidekick and confidant was ferdinand foch see later in text whom he appointed to generalissimo in together they hated the proletariat and the socialists whom both would try to oppress even in russia after the war ended a year and four months into clemenceau s second rule of france the alleged assassin of jaures was freed below are the french officers who lead the most men largely lower class and young to their deaths joffre before the war broke out joffre had already pushed to extend conscription from to years he collaborated with the british mass murdering generals such as kitchener and haig with another robertson he resisted the allied plans to send more men to salonika and to send most of their conscripts to the western front he repeatedly broke protocol by going directly to the british generals rather than his own war ministry joffre hated rotation systems that relieved men from the front lines keeping them longer in hells such as verdun it was joffre that appointed most of the other french mass murderers on this list while dismissing many unsuccessful divisional corps and army commanders it was he that put foch d esperey petain and nivelle in charge of the battles when he didn t lead himself despite the latter two being more junior at the time it was also he who ordered the executions of french conscripts who resisted his orders mangin like earl haig charles mangin got the nickname the butcher one of the few high ranking officials who actually supported nivelle s massacres more under nivelle unlike the other tyrants though he was more interested in the cannonfodder being noire when possible his book la force noire he was persistent in pushing for using men from places that france had colonised this with many opponents to it did lead to the mass recruitment of males from countries in africa so war minded was he though that his book on using foreigners as troops was published already in gave the orders with joffre de cary petain nivelle and others at the catastrophic battle of verdun so many men were killed and wounded under him that after the battle of the aisne was abandoned mangin was sacked so was nivelle who had lead the overall assault but the clemenceau foch conspiracy had a use for such a killer of his men so once foch was promoted to allied supreme commander the two recalled mangin he ended up commanding the tenth army on the western front enabling him to get another frenchmen killed or wounded at the second battle of the marne with foch fayolle and others mangin s catchphrase illustrates his attitude towards the poor men he commanded quoi qu on fasse on perd beaucoup de monde whatever you do you lose a lot of men nivelle robert nivelle knew how to kill men en mass as an artillery general before the war it is helpful to identify any of these mass murderers experiences with lower class men to see how this influenced their eagerness to kill the same demographic under their command sure enough nivelle was involved with class struggle before the war when he went to china to repress their boxer rebellion despite that france was not leading the offence may succeeded philippe petain as commander of the french second army in the battle of verdun nivelle ordered men to their deaths under the guise of counter attacks which were completely pointless to the extent that by the th of june only one fresh reserve brigade was left in the second army the way that nivelle sent men to their deaths even raised the eyebrow of crown prince wilhelm a mass murderer himself see germany section he described the overwhelming view of one battleground where france s best regiments were being destroyed in continually renewed hopeless attacks things got worse as nivelle was appointed commander in chief of the french armies in december this paved the way for the nivelle offensive that christmas day as nivelle was sworn in great britain brought in conscription on the same day all german boys and men from the age of to were called up in the book world war the word given to the execution of nivelle s mass slaughter was murderous on april th nivelle ordered more than one million men to leave their trenches and go over the top into no man s land with that if not before the men were starting to realise what was going on more than french soldiers had been killed on wounded in the first week incredibly nivelle insisted on continuing the bloodshed claiming that he expected a breakthrough at any moment even at the highest levels many had told nivelle to change his plans for the offensive but he completely ignored every one of them at every turn when it became obvious that the plan had fallen into german hands he forced the men on the front lines to continue the men had finally had enough of being sent to their executions they were reading and passing on french socialist and bolshevist publications telling men on the lines about the february revolution russian conscripts in france were spreading the word about the growing class uprising in their country encouraging french and russian conscripts to join in april to mid may the second battle of the aisne under nivelle incurred between and french casualties in early may the nd division refused to follow orders and this spread into a movement that involved more than half of the divisions in the french army tragically while most of these were in the infantry much fewer of their fellow conscripts in field artillery regiments at a safer distance joined them nonetheless nivelle was finally dismissed from that command unfortunately the replacement was called philippe petain petain what do bernard kerik an american at the core of and phillipe petain have in common they are the only mass murderers in their respective campaigns who were actually imprisoned and neither were jailed for their worst standalone crimes you may have heard of petain as he was the prime minister of france in the second world war installed by hitler as the ruler of france under the nazis when the war ended he was convicted of treason and given the death penalty however because he was the oldest french head of state and because of his service in the first world war it was commuted to life imprisonment lets take a look at that service along with foch nivelle mangin de cary and joffre petain was the worst mass murderer of french conscripts he played a part in leading over french men to their deaths or harm in the first battle of the marne along with foch he is the only french general to have forced over frenchmen to their deaths or to assault in his case on three separate occasions for this he was called a national hero and still has his apologists today instead of admitting responsibility for his mass murders he said this is what happens when you re led by socialists it may not be his colour but he is caught red handed when you consider the connection between his mass murders of lower class men and his hatred for that demographic so a connection between the casualties he inflicted on his conscripts and his class politics is not hard to find vehemently anti bolshevik petain hated the left leaning third republic government and upon gaining national power under hitler shut down the trade union confederations firstly the c g t he hated communists and those who allowed them intellectual responsibility previously as minister for war he repeatedly called for a lengthening of the term for compulsory military slavery conscription from two to three years so much did he despise the lower classes that he was offended when his fascist movement was called a revolution his new france would be he said a social heirarchy rejecting the false idea of the natural equality of men which begs the question how accidental can his killing and wounding of over a million lower class frenchmen be petain was also the one in charge of the executions of french conscripts who didnt follow orders so fascist was he in fact that he actually changed the republican motto libert galit fraternit freedom equality brotherhood to travail famille patrie work family fatherland it should come as no surprise then that the british rulership the american president general franco and others campaigned with repeated french governments for his release like the other fascist mass killers on this list to this day he has sympathisers and admirers who take care of his wikipedia page and protest the removal of street names in his honour in the us canada and china a mountain and geological features in canada and his canyon of heroes ribbon on broadway in new york if poor male conscripts were jews eh ps on the subject of new york jews and no justice for evil crimes you ll find the truth of very interesting foch foch was clemenceau s closest conspirator through which french politics was most directly enacted on the battlefield foch and putain were the only french leaders to repeatedly force over frenchmen at a time to their deaths or assault on a single occasion the only top french commander of a battle to do that in one go was francois antoine here is foch on the marshes at st gond proudly declaring his strategy my centre is yielding my right is retreating situation excellent i am attacking this strategy was actually the doctrine taught in his books to french commanders his reputation worsened when these books were cited in the development of the disastrous offensive that brought france close to ruin in august heavy casualties and on the surface a complete lack of tactical awareness that caused allied armies to suffer brought him strong criticism it took joffre removing him probably to save himself which failed as he was sacked days later for his atrocities on the western front to cease unfortunately by then december it was far too late one of the most effective conscript killers of the war he certainly does seem to hate the class demography of his slaves perhaps even more than petain foch led the massive loss of life at the first battle of the marne with joffre d esperey de cary petain and a couple of others with joffre again he led the french into the first battle of ypres he also lead the average frenchman to his unnecessary death in the battle of the somme again with joffre and fayolle as well as joseph alfred micheler and he led the second battle of the marne with other failures including marie emile fayolle and charles mangin the total casualties of the french from these is estimated at between to over men it seems though that foch wanted to get his million it wouldn t be a stretch of the mind to think there was a very dark sadistic competition between these officers not only the spring offensive but also the hundred days offensive were lead by the same two commanders foch and petain the spring offensive caused around casualties for france alone you would think that the same pair of leaders wouldn t be put in charge together again but the french government seemed to approve of the suffering and murder of so many lower class men and boys so in the hundred days offensive the french government let foch and petain get more french males killed or injured while foch is responsible for many more french deaths under his command his total from those mentioned here seems to be between and casualties of his own men its hard to imagine that anyone could kill more of their men if they were trying to that point becomes more than sinister when you learn that foch like petain and other commanders both in france and in britain russia and germany would have had a motive to try we saw that petain had no problem surrendering to the germans because that s exactly what he did in the second world war for his own powergrab defending france s autonomy was clearly not his motive what motives did his partner in mass murder have to kill almost as many lower class men as he did not content with killing french civilians after the first world war ended ferdinand foch jumped at the chance when his expertise in killing the proletariat was requested by the poles the enemy the lower class male bolsheviks of revolutionary russia clemenceau sent foch to work with a polish counter revolutionary josef pilsudski to crush the proletariat revolution in russia foch s plan involved a coordinated offensive against the bolsheviks with a multi national army the intervention forces would be supplied by the allies and of course under the overall command of marshal foch himself foch s commander then clemenceau hated the bolsheviks to the point where he refused them access to the peace talks threatening to resign if the bolsheviks would have sent their delegates to paris he said the extremists would have been encouraged and then the middle classes would have panicked this class consciousness is surely something clemenceau and foch had in common marshal foch tried to devise all sorts of plans to attack in russia against the bolsheviks by using armies made up of poles finns czechs slovaks romanians and even russian prisoners of war still in germany but nothing materialized this wasn t that surprising as by this stage he was exposing himself as the obsessive maniac that he was even the french weren t behind him the soldiers he was assembling thought it too dangerous even the british and the americans refused to get involved in the scheme foch said he feared a germany russia alliance one of the only other delegates to think that was remotely possible was winston churchill so now foch had a go at leading the killing of british men too he said it was urgent to conscript british men after wwi and send them to russia to stop the advance of bolshevism before it penetrated austria and germany churchill supported foch s appeal but fortunately others in britain didn t it was immensely unpopular according to sir henry wilson and this immense unpopularity should have suffocated foch everywhere he went it seems that foch s ideals were clear motive we need to crush the proletariat means set up conscription so i can drag all the proletariat threat in under my command opportunity kill the proletariat by using my authority to send them into a death zone it turns out that the three year conscription law of pushed in parlaiment by clemenceau had been co authored by tardieu and none other than ferdinand foch himself it had originally been proposed by premier briand before any outbreak of the world war not in reaction to it briand is also a figure of interest as he attended a meeting on poncaire s train about the upcoming anglo french offensive on the somme which we know resulted in one of the greatest losses of men in british french and german history the others present were foch then commander of army group north and the worst of the british man killers earl haig in this train carriage were perhaps the worst battle commanding killers of their own citizens in history it would have been interesting to overhear their conversation on that train carriage on may st according to international abolition of conscription the most vociferous about maintaining an excuse to have a french conscript army after the first world war was also ferdinand foch in fact something that concerns many of us outside france it was largely foch who prevented the adoption of agreements for the international abolition of conscription read that again that by consequence might elevate ferdinand foch to the status of the worst mass murderer in recorded history not least considering what would follow two decades later in his mangled brain it was the belief that the treaty of versailles was actually too lenient on the germans that prompted him to say of it as supreme allied commander this is not peace it is an armistice for twenty years foch had proven his level of evil to the other powers britain consequently made him a field marshal the rank that commands the entire british army in amp x b and what of great britain s rulers were they just in it to win a war or did they have a proletariat killing heirarchy of their own i hope to continue this series by questioning next the willful british german and russian annihilation of their male lower classes by addressing such mass genocidalists as earl haig and lord kitchener of britain ludendorff of germany and brusilov of russia conclusion with the means the motive and the opportunity there are definite suspects that stand out on the basis of the otherwise inexplicable number of potential revolutionaries with bolshevic like motivations that they forced to death and disability at the time when the underclass and working class young men of russia britain germany and france were threatening to rise up against their establishment oppressors the willingness to force these very same men into the killing fields to suffer such unbelievable casualties is an issue where assuming good intentions just isn t good enough if it happened then and still even today they have not been held to account then it can happen today with the same result conscription is never acceptable it can easily be used as a weapon for class and gender genocide and it is our job to fight it for all men and boys of the present and the future thank you for reading we will remember them
8966,i was scrolling through instagram and i stumbled across a male privilege checklist most of you are probably aware of however me and a friend of mine u finallyreborn still wanted to cover its points here i will segregate the post into two sections part i which will be addressed by me and part ii which is addressed by him also the points are not in order but i don t think that matters what matters are the points themselves part i gt my odds of being hired for a job when competing against female applicants are probably skewed in my favor the more prestigious the job the larger the odds are skewed how do i begin to unpack this stem favours women in a ratio of blind hiring that is the gender of the applicant is not known favours men whereas non blind recruitment favours women by a couple percentage points men on average are more likely to be discriminated against when job hunting which includes both male and female dominated jobs this study also found discrimination against men in hiring this and this article on discrimination against women in science which examine more than hiring find either no bias against women or more anti male than anti female bias in science the idea men won t face discrimination in hiring and the odds are skewed in their favour especially in prestigious fields like stem is false the narrative stems from gender stereotypes such as female vulnerability that expects women to always be the recipients of discriminaton or injustice which itself is a type of bias against men gt if i am never promoted it s not because of my sex that s supported by most of the claims which are made in this checklist are either baseless or outright false and one sided see above gt i am far less likely to face sexual harassment at work than are my female co workers perhaps it is true men are less likely to face sexual harassment in the workplace though i am skeptical of the word far men represent in complaints of sexual harassment in the workplace in the us and the number could be heavily under counted as men often under report their abuse here and here attitudes like this exist if a woman pats a man s butt admiringly asks whether he s been working out and suggestively compliments him on how good he looks people chuckle if the roles were reversed those same people would be outraged and rightfully so it could also be that men are less likely to be taken seriously and women are less likely to be viewed as perpetrators in the horizon oil sands work camp in alberta men who are caught in women s dorms are fired on the spot while women are allowed in the men s dorm rooms harassment in general is reported to be proportionally equal for both sexes this study looked at bullying at work and found that men and women did not differ in prevalence another study looked at workplace bullying and found no significant differences in the bullying experiences of men and women a study in sweden looked at the prevalence of mobbing in the workplace which is defined as harassing ganging up on someone or psychologically terrorising others at work and found men and women are subjected to workplace mobbing in roughly equal proportions the difference not being significant a report by statscan found that of women and of men experienced workplace harassment in the past year gt if i m a teen or adult and if i stay out of prison my odds of being raped are so low as to be negligible false the odds of men being raped outside of prison which is obviously excluded to prove a point are not low or negligible once you start to look at rape in a more nuanced manner and expand the definition of rape to be inclusive of victims who weren t penetrated and were instead forced to penetrate their perpetrators the narrative crumbles apart i also love how they say if i stay out of prison as if men simply choose to be in prison and there is no bias in sentencing and men s criminal behaviour is not a product of environmental causes like fatherlessness which is not true to get back to the the rape of men outside of prison which we will conveniently exclude because reasons is low to the point of being negligible claim the national intimate partner and sexual violence survey would like to disagree the nisvs showed that during the proceeding months of the survey of men were made to penetrate and of women were raped table and pages the nisvs showed that in the past months of the survey of men were made to penetrate and of women were raped table page the nisvs showed that in the past months of men were made to penetrate and of women were raped table a and a on pages and the nisvs showed that in the past months of men were made to penetrate and of women were raped just as a side note we say made to penetrate instead of rape as the cdc does not consider made to penetrate to be rape and instead puts it in the category of sexual assault which leads to media under reporting of the problem of the rape of men the idea that the rape of men outside of prison is low or negligible is another myth that is rooted in gender norms which are again more advantageous to women as their victimisation is universally recognised whereas men s victimisation is swept under the rug in case anybody brings up the fact that i am only quoting annual data and not lifetime data which found a high prevalence of male victimisation once made to penetrate is lumped in the same category as rape i am doing that because lifetime data has less accuracy as it runs into more problems such as memory loss confusion of events how well one interpreted their victimisation which might have taken place long ago etc this source notes research tells us that of critical details are irretrievable after one year of their occurance and are irretrievable after years this could heavily skew the data in favour of women as they are less likely to internalise their victimisation and more likely to report gt if i choose not to have children my masculinity will not be called into question incorrect here and here gt if i have children and provide primary care for them i ll be praised for extraordinary parenting even if i m marginally competent assuming that s true for the sake of argument it is only half of the story that is while there are fathers single or married who are praised for doing mommy s work often for a valid reason there are also fathers who encounter day to day stereotypes and hardships for not living up to their traditional role of a provider for instance this survey found mothers are seen as better caregivers and fathers are more likely to be pressured to work more and be financially liable for their families we can reason that if that s the case then a man who breaks out of his gender role and takes on a mother s job will be seen as a deviant and often encounter negative stereotypes about his gender and his abilities will be put to question this video interview skip to as the actual video has been made private describes motherhood which it synonymously links to parenthood as the hardest job additionally anybody who has spent some time on social media platforms such as twitter can notice a pattern of people including verified accounts turning father s day into a day about single mothers or mothers in general therefore it is quite absurd to say that a father who is marginally competent as a caregiver will receive extraordinary praise as opposed to a mother who does the same job better gt if i seek political office my relationship with my children or who i hire to care for them will probably not be scrutinised by the press unless of course you re donald trump in which case everything you do will be examined by the media and used against you this article analyses donald trump s realationship with his son barron trump and this article goes on to examine how trump s children grew up relatively normal as well as who took care of them etc etc gt i can be somewhat sure that if i ask to see the person in charge i will face a person of my own sex the higher up in the organization the person the surer i can be that benefits me how as a woman if you go outside the odds are the overwhelming majority of people at the bottom you will see such as construction workers or the unsheltered homeless will be men gt as a child i could choose from an almost infinite variety of children s media featuring positive active non stereotyped heroes of my own sex i never had to look for it male protagonists were are the default as a child i saw myself represented as an antagonist in almost every cartoon or tv show the servants of each villain who were killed one after another like a disposable pile of garbage were also universally male such servants continue to be almost universally male as people prefer men dying in movies to women dying or being tortured the default protagonist is not male either black widow captain marvel supergirl the existence of male protagonists in most movies especially romantic ones encouraged boys to turn into risk taking or self sacrificing men who leave their well being behind to protect people especially women and children gt if my day week or year is going badly i need not ask of each negative episode or situation whether it has sexist overtons privilege is not defined or measured by one s inability to recognise whether somebody was sexist to them or not because of how normalised society s inability to spot misandry is privilege is having society pander to you and your issues to the point where you become paranoid and question everything or everybody for potentially being misogynistic to you and always blaming others for your misery because of how little accountability you are expected to take for your own problems it is not women caused their own issues it is almost always society or he caused these issues meanwhile for men it is almost always he caused his own issues or other men caused his issues gt if i am careless with my financial affairs it won t be attributed to my sex as a woman if i am incapable of earning enough money or a high income that won t be blamed on my sex s inability to provide gt i can speak to a large group of people without putting my sex on trial so can women in fact women can freely talk about raping men on a stage that is supposed to be empowering to women and treat it like a joke gt there are value neutral clothing choices available to me it is possible for me to choose clothing that doesn t send any particular message to the world so it is for women women can also wear their boyfriends casual clothing and still be seen as cute a man wearing a dress or his girlfriend s clothing is enough for him to be called a beta male emasculated cuck by prominent political figures such as candace owens or even beaten up in more traditional countries whereas women can wear traditionally masculine clothing such as suits and nobody bats an eye men are also expected to wear clothing and accessories which signify status to the world expensive watches ties suits gt if i am not conventionally attractive the disadvantages are small and easy to ignore not if you are short and skinny employment opportunities decline so do dating opportunities i wouldn t consider that to be easy to ignore gt i can ask for legal protection from violence that happens mostly to men without being seen as a selfish special interest since that kind of violence is called crime and is a general social concern violence that happens mostly to women is usually called domestic violence or acquaintance rape and is seen as a special interest issue this one is so detached from any observable reality that you can lose brain cells just reading it crime that happens to men is not seen as a special social concern domestic violence and rape are both called crimes if not some of the worst crimes one can do to another rape is so vile that only murder is worse if they are listed out as separate issues that is because they are viewed as separate more concerning crimes which we should pay more attention to or at least not because it happens to men the crime which is gendered against men is homicide male so it might sometimes make sense to prioritise it say over intimate partner violence which is also male check out the nisvs however violence against men is not seen as a special concern violence against women by men is seen as a special concern you will rarely see campaigns saying end violence against men teach women not to be violent but almost all of such gendered campaigns are gendered to favour women domestic violence and the rape of women are put at the front of political discourse to the point where universities deny male students their due process rights when they are accused of rape women are systemically favoured in both police intervention and services for victims of domestic abuse the overwhelming majority of services are for women and the overwhelming majority of batterer programs are for men that is in spite of the consensus in family violence research being that women commit intimate partner violence equally if not more once you account for unilateral violence which is mostly done by women and lesbian on lesbian violence which tops heterosexual violence and gay male violence in some other countries like india or spain male victims have even fewer legal protections from partner abuse which in spain is labelled gendered violence the blog is in spanish so use a translator to understand it if you are not spanish the idea male victimisation is a special concern and that s a privilege is laughable and not in touch with reality in reality violence against men is and has been minimised dismissed or excused especially when it takes the form of genital mutilation where boys are mutilated in the states their foreskins are sold for profit and they have no explicit protections from the practice meanwhile fgm is seen as a separate special kind of violence in states men wanting more services when they have less even though they should have more are called misogynists who are stealing resources from women and researchers or activists who discover or say that dv is symmetrical are blacklisted e g straus pizzey silverman who ended up killing himself after he opened up the first male only shelter in canada and was bullied to death by the government which denied him assistance as male victimisation is not sufficient enough to warrant the amount of protection and funding he needed see this as well the overwhelming majority of moral and psychological experiments also show violence against women is viewed as a more despicable and morally reprehensible phenomenon than violence against men see here so yes men are called selfish even though they are less protected from violence both legally and culturally who isn t those who demand more and more protection for women even at the expense of men and then call that male privilege when male victims are treated like second class citizens not worthy of equal protection to assist them in times of need gt my ability to make important decisions and my capability in general will never be questioned depending on what time of the month it is my inability to take risks be competent make life or death decisions and be emotionally stable will be challenged more than a woman s regardless of what time of the month it is gt the decision to hire me will never be based on assumptions about whether or not i might choose to have a family sometime soon the capacity of a man to provide for his wife and children or his future family can be taken into account in some hiring practices gt most major religions argue that i should be the head of my household while my wife and children should be subservient to me feminists and their cherry picking abilities husbands love your wives the way christ loved the church and gave himself up for her king james bible husbands should love their wives the way christ loved the church and gave his life for it contemporary english version source yes the bible and other religions alike did tell women to be submissive to their husbands but they also expected mutual and similar obligations of husbands the bible being one example also the term the head of the household is another word for a wage slave as being the head of the household entails having to be fully financially liable for the support of your family in some countries like japan women and men often take on traditional gender roles but the wife usually controls most of the budget while her husband is left with pocket money in spite of working more gt if i have children with a wife or girlfriend chances are she ll do most of the childrearing and in particular the most dirty repetitive and unrewarding parts of childrearing historically and presently men were and are pushed away from childrearing in marriage and post marriage due to custody problems women on the other hand are given a flexible option and the source shows the overwhelming majority of women choose and prefer flexibility to work life so they end up doing more childcare and housework in many countries men struggle to get access to paternity leave and can t take on the caregiver role which is traditionally associated with women because they are expected to work feminists as per usual only give us half of the story which in fact shows women have more flexibility than men gt magazines billboards television movies pornography and virtually all of media is filled with imagines of scantily clad women intended to appeal to me sexually such imagines of men exist but are much rarer of course that also ignores how often men are depicted as deadbeats irresponsible clumsy easily controlled macho incapable of being a decent parent etc by many tv shows and commercials alike or how often the media plays the sexual assault of men especially in prison and the sexual assault of men by women for laughs this is a follow up video but oh well we will only show you how attractive women are displayed on billboards to get men s dicks hard so companies can profit gt if i am heterosexual it s incredibly unlikely that i ll ever be beaten up by a spouse or lover wrong wrong just so wrong this study found women inflict severe violence on their partners more than men and men are more likely to sustain severe abuse this study found women are more likely to inflict severe violence on their partners than men are and men are more likely to sustain violent abuse however women reported being beaten up more of women compared to of men than their male counterparts men were much more likely to be kicked bitten hit with fists or an object and threatened with a knife gun they were also just as likely to experience the use of a knife gun the national intimate partner and sexual violence survey found that over of victims of severe psychological and physical violence which includes being punched kicked etc are men these studies and reviews here and here find no evidence that women abuse in retaliation or self defense or that women are less likely to strike the first blow more likely to exercise violence in self defense than men are in fact this survey found of one sided abuse is committed by women and the majority of intimate partner violence is bilateral committed by both partners with women hitting first more often this blog post responds to feminist claims on domestic abuse and criticism of the cts scale the claim that men are rarely abused by their partners and women are innocent victims who rarely commit intimate partner violence just like the claim that men outside of prison are rarely raped and men are not discriminated against in hiring comes from gender stereotypes which put women in a vulnerable position to men and such gender stereotypes are inherently advantageous to women as they lead to female victims of violence being believed and or taken seriously more often than male victims gt on average i am not interrupted by women as often as women are interrupted by men that darling oppression being interrupted or letting others interrupt you due to your agreeableness and incapability of displaying dominance or assertiveness poor women here s an actual undeserved privilege as a woman your opinions will be rarely dismissed and called womansplaining purely because you are a woman as a woman you won t be accused of womanterrupting when you interrupt another woman or man while men will be accused of both sometimes on tv or in official settings gt as a child chances are i got more teacher attention than girls who raised their hand just as often this male privilege is addressed in the book the war against boys even if what was said is true it s not necessarily evidence of actual discriminaton against girls as it could be caused by a multitude of factors including the fact that girls outperform boys are the majority of a students get better grades on average are more likely to attend higher education and are less likely to be subjected to punishment for their behavior so naturally when a boy raises his hand teachers might be inclined to pick him instead because he rarely gets the chance to talk or show his skills the idea of male privilege in the classroom is laughable almost as laughable as saying violence against women is taken less seriously than violence against men which is what you did not so long ago once one looks at the stats on who is getting the upper hand and overacheiving before somebody stops me and says but that outcome is a consequence of girls working harder than boys well no it isn t boys and girls actually get identical grades if not boys outperform girls on subjects traditionally associated with masculinity such as mathematics and science but are systemically downgraded on teacher assessments which causes them to underperform and be discouraged from competing alongside girls teacher bias is a strong predictor for the disparities in achievement between the sexes here here here here here here here and here of sex selective scholarships are reserved for women too and the system sides with female complaints of discrimination more than it does with male complaints in almost every sector from grading discrimination to the denial of due process rights to accused men some schools admit to gender bias such as this one additionally this study which analysed economic spending on children s education by parents from to found that parents spend more on girls education than boys education and this article explores the relationship between gender stereotypes and the suppression of boy behavior which is deemed to be aggressive in schools could disruptive behavior explain part of the disparity in achievement yes but it doesn t dispute the existence of bias either it is rather simplistic to look at disruptive behavior as boys doing it to themselves when such behavior can be caused by factors which are outside of boys control such as family breakdowns as well as single parenthood and the lack of a father figure at home which might impact boys differently than girls this report from hrw also found that in places where corporal punishment is still practiced or was practiced boys were subject to punishment disproportionately to girls and while it would be irrational to attribute all of the disparity to bias it would be no surprise if bias played a role in it the article notes one high school teacher suggested one possible reason for the gender disparity in paddling noting that at her school it was common practice to stay away from hitting the girls i guess they re more fragile and a lot of them could be pregnant and we wouldn t know it a father of two boys and a girl felt that it was more acceptable for boys to be paddled than girls he explained my little girl don t you put your hands on her as far as my boys i am super hard on them for one they are young black men and they are faced with different obstacles in life i get on them every day and i know they say man my dad is tough many interviewees reported that boys were beaten more harshly than girls a middle school boy in mississippi observed that one of his teachers paddle the boys real hard and when he paddled the girls he don t really hit them one student reported that there are smaller paddles for girls they use a short one for girls and a long one for the boys gt i have the privilege of not being aware of my male privilege women have the privilege of lying giving society one sided narratives half truths and still being believed men do not have such a privilege
10540,while it s established men can at the very least be victims of domestic violence the exact statistics tend to be misleading as institutions with a feminist agenda try to find loop holes to the statistics it s cultural knowledge that men are stronger than women therefor they must commit serious domestic violence more right men are victims of dv just as much if not more than women are here is a bibliography examining scholarly investigations empirical studies and reviews and or analyses which demonstrate that women are as physically aggressive or more aggressive than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners the aggregate sample size in the reviewed studies exceeds here s the worlds largest set of meta analyses on domestic violence by pask with researchers taking place in dozens of different regions around the world researchers were asked to conduct a formal search for published peer reviewed studies through standard widely used search programs and then catalogue and summarize all known research studies relevant to each major topic and its sub topics approximately studies were considered and more than were summarized and organized into tables here are some of the key findings among large population samples of intimate partner violence ipv reported was bi directional uni directional of the uni directional violence was male to female mfpv was female to male fmpv among school and college samples percentage of bi directional violence was was mfpv and was fmpv male and female ipv perpetrated from similar motives primarily to get back at a partner for emotionally hurting them because of stress or jealousy to express anger and other feelings that they could not put into words or communicate and to get their partner s attention eight studies directly compared men and women in the power control motive and subjected their findings to statistical analyses three reported no significant gender differences and one had mixed findings one paper found that women were more motivated to perpetrate violence as a result of power control than were men and three found that men were more motivated however gender differences were weak more than studies have shown that domestic abuse in relationships is gender symmetrical with men and women perpetrating dv at approximately equal rates the most common form of dv is reciprocal violence and when it is not mutual female only and male only partner violence occur with similar frequency among married couples the following study found that of relationships which had violence were reciprocally violent and that in non reciprocally violent relationships women were the perpetrators in more than of cases this study took place in the netherlands approximately of domestic violence is perpetrated by women while of those ending up in prison for domestic violence are men the study discovered that men and women commit domestic violence for very similar reasons but the differences concluded women slapped bit or hit men significantly more than men did women were significantly less likely to be under the influence of alcohol while committing the domestic violence and women indicated more often that they were insulted before they committed domestic violence they also found that men are less likely to report their victimization and that men probably cause more serious damage that is noticed more easily by the police due to males being stronger than females in australia this study found that men were being physically assaulted by their partners as much as women furthermore women and men were about equally likely to admit being violent themselves men and women also reported experiencing about the same levels of pain and need for medical attention resulting from domestic violence in another study done in australia by murray straus he found that of physical violence between dating partners during the previous months was perpetrated by males only by females only and was mutual violence where both partners used violence against each other sexual assault by intimate partner in this study with a sample size of university students from cites around the world participants reported their sexual victimization by an intimate partner within the last year of the survey being taken place of men and of women reported being victim in their former or current relationship more men reported being victim of forced sex whereas slightly more women reported being victim of verbal coercion in this iranian study data from the international dating violence study the lifetime prevalence of sexual intimate partner violence victimization was for men and for women the lifetime prevalence of sexual ipv perpetration was for men and for women domestic violence related murders a common rhetoric here in australia my home country is that one woman per week is killed by an intimate partner of course they never bring up the draw of comparison to men because if they did their narrative would fall apart as the difference is so minuscule according to the australian bureau of statistics they found that in men compromised of just under half victims of all victims of family domestic violence related murders and according to the australian institute of criminology one man dies by the hands of his partner per ten days here is a researcher on an australian radio show that summarizes the stat and in the us roughly of domestic violence related deaths are towards women which is a slight majority but when you include assisted and staged suicides just as many men are killed because of domestic violence as women and including killings where the women use a payed killer getting a male lover friend and so on to commit violence on their behalf which subsequently gets recorded either as being both perpetrated and instigated by the third party male or and even if the wife is found to be implicated as a multiple offender killing without reference to the wife meaning the rates that women kill their male partners would be understated and most possibly could be killing their partners at higher rates then men wives also tend to murder by subterfuge classically through poisoning and i d wager that these types of homicide go undetected far more than the overt actions of their male counterparts do an interesting fact relating to domestic homicides is however that the rate of men who are murdered by intimate partners has decreased over the years in comparison to women roughly years ago women murdered their male partners at roughly the same rate as the reverse research suggests that this change in prevalence is because domestic violence shelters for women were opened during the same time period as many domestic violence related killings are in retaliation to being abused themselves but there is conflating evidence to the motivation behind domestic homicides for modern women for instance this study found that financial gain is one of the most common motivators for women who kill and disproves the idea that women who kill their partners are only ever acting defensively against abusers so this could suggest throughout history men and women who kill their partners were acting in self defence but as domestic violence shelters exclusively for women opened up women had an escape route whereas there are next to no shelters for men which could be a reason why men are slightly overrepresented in domestic violence killings it also suggests that women are more likely to kill out of malice for the reason of financial gain whereas men are more likely to kill out of self defence and this following study found that of suicides men commit are in response to intimate partner violence victimization when domestic violence related suicides are combined with domestic violence homicides the total numbers of domestic violence related deaths are higher for males than females why has this news been hidden for so long first is that men are roughly times less likely to report their victimization to the authorities by the age of men were more likely than women to have never told anybody about experiencing partner violence around more likely than women to have never sought advice or support about experiencing partner violence almost more likely than women to have not contacted police about experiencing partner violence and less than half as likely as women to have had a restraining order issued against the perpetrator of previous partner violence and this study found that males appear to report their own victimization less than females do and to not view female violence against them as a crime hence they differentially under report being victimized by partners on crime victim surveys a case is made for a paradigm having developed amongst family violence activists and researchers that precludes the notion of female violence trivializes injuries to males and maintains a monolithic view of a complex social problem this pattern is so pronounced that when laws were passed requiring the police to automatically press charges when called for domestic disturbances the number of women arrested on domestic violence charges increased dramatically this has been referred to as an unintended consequence by the proponents of these bills who thought that they would see an increase in the number of arrests for men instead feminists also tend to deny and distort the evidence relating to gender symmetry in dv the following study found the following method suppress evidence researchers with a commitment to the idea that men are almost always the sole perpetrator or whose commitment to increase services to women victims of pv is so strong that it overrides their commitment to science as shown previously often leads to concealing evidence that contradicts this belief in addition many researchers not committed to that ideology have withheld results showing gender symmetry to avoid becoming victims of vitriolic denunciations and ostracism see method below a typical pattern is to publish only the data on male perpetrators or female victims deliberately omitting data on female perpetrators and male victims this practice started with one of the first general population surveys on family violence the survey done for the kentucky commission on the status of women obtained data on both men and women but only the data on male perpetration was published schulman among the many other examples of respected researchers publishing data on assaults by men and the data on assaults by women are kennedy and dutton lackey and williams johnson and leone and kaufman kantor and straus method avoid obtaining or analysing data on female perpetration due to prevailing ideology that women are almost never perpetrators of pv and men are almost never victims researchers designing surveys have typically asked female participants only about attacks by their male partners and male respondents only about perpetration to achieve this the canadian national violence against women survey johnson amp sacco modified the conflict tactics scales by omitting the questions on perpetration by the female participants in the study the american national violence against women survey tjaden amp thoennes sponsored by the department of justice originally planned the same strategy fortunately the us centres for disease control added a sample of men to the project but when johnson and leone johnson amp leone investigated the prevalence of intimate terrorists among the participants in that study they guaranteed there would be no female intimate terrorists by using only the data on male perpetration many other studies of pv have also omitted questions about female perpetration and male victimization many agencies do not permit collection of data on pv unless questions on female perpetration are omitted this may have been the reason that a comprehensive four site study of batterer treatment programs asked the women only about violence by the partner gondolf this was a tremendous lost opportunity because it may be the only comprehensive study of male offenders which had access to their female partners method cite only studies that show male perpetration another method used to conceal evidence of gender symmetry is to selectively cite studies of male perpetration and avoid citing studies of female perpetration us government world health organization and united nations documents show that this method of concealment and distortion is institutionalized in official publications for example us dept of justice publications almost always cite only the national crime victimization study which shows male predominance durose et al they fail to mention the department of justice published critiques which led to a revision of the survey but which that only partly corrected that bias straus not only do department of justice publications on pv rely on data that they previously acknowledged is inaccurate for measuring pv but they also ignore a major and more accurate study that they themselves sponsored the national violence against women survey this study found that women perpetrate about of pv incidents which is close to gender symmetry in perpetration the widely acclaimed and influential world health organization report on domestic violence krug et al reports that where violence by women occurs it is more likely to be in the form of self defence this is selective citation because almost all studies that have compared men and women find about equal rates of self defence perhaps even worse none of the three studies cited provide evidence supporting the quoted sentence for example study saunders amp hanusa shows that about two thirds of female perpetrated pv was not in self defence study dekeseredy saunders schwartz amp shahid found that only of women said their violence was in self defence study johnson amp ferraro is a review paper that has no original data it cites and neither of which supports the claim a closely related method is to present the results on female perpetration male victimization and say nothing about those results the us department of justice report on pv gives a chart showing trends for both men and women from to catalano b the only thing said about trends in male victimization i e female perpetration is that the rate of nonfatal intimate partner victimization for males increased between and returning to levels last seen in and for white males victimization increased between and from to it is almost certain that that there would be a commentary and an extensive analysis if nonfatal pv victimization of white females had increased between and from to victimizations per i e if the female victimization rate had doubled but the doubling in the male victimization rate was ignored method conclude that results refute symmetry when they do not the studies cited above in addition to be illustrating selective citation are also examples of the ability of ideological commitment to lead researchers to misinterpret the results of their own research a study by kernsmith for example states that males and females were found to differ in their motivations for using violence in relationships p and that female violence may be more related to maintaining personal liberty in a relationship than gaining power p although kernsmith s table shows that women had higher scores on the striking back factor only one question in this factor is about self defence and this item is endorsed infrequently other more frequently endorsed items are about being angry e g to show anger and getting back at a partner e g to get back at your partner for hurting you emotionally in contrast to the idea that women use violence to maintain liberty these finding suggest that women are more likely than men to use violence in retaliatory anger in addition kernsmith s conclusion ignores the fact that the scores for men and women were approximately equal in respect to two of the three factors exerting power and disciplining partner thus kernsmith s study generally found the opposite of what was stated as the finding method create evidence by citation the kernsmith s study the world health organization report and the pattern of selective citation show how ideology can be converted into evidence by citation or what gelles calls the woozle effect a woozle effect occurs when the frequent citation of assertion in previous publications that lack evidence mislead us into thinking there is evidence for example subsequent to the world health organization study and the kernsmith study papers discussing gender differences in motivation will cite them to show that female violence is predominantly in self defence which is the opposite of what the research actually shows but because these are citations of an article in a scientific journal and a respected international organization readers of the subsequent article will accept it as a fact thus fiction is converted into scientific evidence that will be cited over and over and further strengthen the woozle effect another well documented example is the claim that the conflict tactics scales straus hamby boney mccoy amp sugarman does not provide an adequate measure of pv because it measures only conflict related violence although the theoretical basis of the cts is conflict theory the introductory explanation to participants specifically asks participants to report expressive and malicious violence it asks respondents about the times when they and their partner disagree get annoyed with the other person want different things from each other or just have spats or fights because they are in a bad mood are tired or for some other reason despite repeating this criticism for years in perhaps a hundred publications we have not located any empirical study which has provided evidence showing that only conflict related violence is reported in fact where there is both cts data and qualitative data as in giles sims it shows that the cts elicits malicious violence as well as conflict related violence nevertheless because there are at least a hundred articles with this statement in peer reviewed journals it is treated as an established scientific fact method obstruct funding of research that might contradict the idea that male dominance is the cause of pv an example of denying funding to research that might contradict the idea that pv is a male only crime is the call for proposals to investigate pv issued in december by the national institute of justice the announcement stated that proposals to investigate male victimization would not be eligible another example is the objection by a reviewer to a proposal one of us submitted because of naming violence in a relationships as a human problem of aggression not a gender based problem when priority scores by the reviewers are averaged it takes only one extremely low score to place the proposal below the fundable level others have encountered similar blocks for example holtzworth munroe eugen lupri a pioneer canadian family violence researcher has also documented examples of the resistance to funding and publishing research on female perpetrated violence lupri method harass threaten and penalize researchers who produce evidence that contradicts feminist beliefs suzanne steinmetz made the mistake of publishing a book and articles steinmetz steinmetz which clearly showed about equal rates of perpetration by males and females anger over this resulted in a bomb threat at her daughters wedding and she was the object of a letter writing campaign to deny her promotion and tenure at the university of delaware twenty years later the same processes resulted in a lecturer at the university of manitoba whose dissertation found gender symmetry in pv being denied promotion and tenure a phd student working with straus was warned at a conference that she will never get a job if she does her phd research with him at the university of massachusetts straus was prevented from speaking by shouts and stomping at two hearings held by the canadian commission on violence against women the chairperson stated that nothing murray straus publishes can be believed because he is a wife beater and sexually exploits students toronto magazine article when straus was elected president of the society for the study of social problems a group of members occupied the first few rows of the auditorium and at the start of the presidential address stood up and walked out as a result of these types of harassment there is widespread self censorship by authors who fear that publishing politically incorrect data will undermine their reputation or in the case of graduate students their ability to obtain a job discrimination against male victims of domestic violence and in favour of female perpetrators in this study male and female undergraduates read one of four domestic abuse cases varying by victim and perpetrator sex and sexual orientation the results found that sexual orientation mattered very little compared to the victims sex male on female violence was considered to be the most serious and deserving of active intervention domestic violence perpetrated by men or against women was judged more serious than domestic violence perpetrated by women or against men perceptions that male perpetrators were more capable of injuring victims and female victims were more likely to suffer serious injury were consistent with gender role stereotypes in this next study they gave mock trial jurors identical descriptions of domestic violence incidents changing only the gender jurors were far more likely to find the man guilty of the crime than the woman the following paper examined domestic violence from a dimension that is not common in the literature wherein the females are the perpetrators a subject area that has received very little academic attention in nigeria as a whole and even far less in ibadan north local government area it identified the factors that have been implicated in domestic violence against men in the home specifically focusing on abuses perpetrated against men by women it has confirmed that perpetrators of domestic violence against men are varied it refutes notions that give the impression that men are only abusive to women while women are passive recipients of abuse the under reporting of domestic violence against men due to embarrassment or fear of ridicule is a major challenge in nigeria as a result of the sensitive nature of the subject the victims are often in self denial male victims are often disbelieved due to the patriarchal nature of the nigerian society wherein it is believed that men are usually spouse abusers this study is the first that utilizes a large u s national based sample to assess the experiences of men who sustained multiple types of ipv from their female partners and sought help it is also the first that assesses the relationship between male experiences in seeking help for victimization and their mental health status the findings emphasize the need for more education about male ipv victims who might need services and of the potential consequences to the mental health of victims when they cannot obtain help the resources providing the least support to men seeking help for ipv victimization are those that are the core of the dv service system dv agencies dv hotlines and the police on the one hand about of men who sought help from dv hotlines were connected with resources that were helpful this is in comparison to for women on the other hand nearly of men reported that these dv agencies and hotline were not at all helpful many reported being turned away the qualitative accounts in our research tell a story of male help seekers who are often doubted ridiculed and given false information thus their hypotheses that men who would have largely negative experiences with formal resources were supported which is consistent with prior qualitative research the male victims who looked for help also were often redirected to batterers programs out of the men who called the police many reported being ridiculed by the police or incorrectly arrested as the primary aggressor or the police failed to respond within the judicial system some men who sustained dv reported experiencing gender stereotyped treatment even with apparent corroborating evidence that their female partners were violent and that the help seekers were not they reportedly lost custody of their children were blocked from seeing their children and were falsely accused by their partners of dv and abusing their children here s a paper that was published by the home office research and statistics department it contains very detailed information on how men and women are treated in cases of domestic homicide it asserts that differences do exist in the way men and women are treated in the criminal justice system but these differences largely favour women it finds that despite recent claims to the contrary women are at less risk of imprisonment than men even in cases of domestic homicide an analysis of cases dealt with between and shows that shows that of females compared with only of males indicted for homicide were acquitted on all charges of those found guilty of the women compared with of the men were found guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter and more than two thirds of the men convicted of manslaughter received a prison sentence compared with less than half the women so to sum up women indicted for domestic homicide were more likely than men to be acquitted if found guilty women were more likely than men to be convicted of manslaughter instead of murder women convicted of manslaughter were less likely than men to receive a prison sentence it does not provide information about the average length of the sentences which men and women received but i think this is useful information anyway in this following study that analysed domestic violence agencies found that only actually acknowledged men as victims of domestic violence and indicated they provided some type of services to them however their acknowledgement and services they stated for male victims were limited and clearly demonstrated that male victims continue to be an underserved and under recognized population as victims of domestic violence as the literature above indicates male victims of domestic violence continue to encounter barriers when seeking help from formal services to obtain equal services that women receive from these agencies duluth model and vawa the duluth model is entirely based on feminist theory ellen pence the woman credited with creating the model has stated this in her thesis in gt i am indebted to the domestic abuse intervention project daip where i have worked for years as a group we have been an important part of a historic social movement we were the first grassroots group to break through the barrier of institutional resistance to establishing community monitored interagency policies including policies mandating arrest promoting aggressive prosecution imposing increasingly harsh penalties on repeat offenders and requiring a feminist based educational model for abusers this speaks to the excellence of our group as well as to that of the leaders in our police and court system to my co workers and the many practitioners who have lent to my experience and to this specific endeavour i am eternally grateful the duluth model currently reigns as the most commonly state mandated model of intervention while many approaches to intervention include a mix of the duluth model s feminist analysis of dv and cognitive behavioural therapy which is a more holistically oriented approach to dv that maintains that dv is associated with cognitive distortions and faulty attitudes and beliefs most existing intervention programs as well as state laws and guidelines that regulate ipv intervention still espouse key aspects of feminist perspectives on ipv etiology and intervention the duluth model characterises domestic violence as being a primarily male perpetrated crime caused by patriarchal terrorism theorising that men are socialised in a patriarchal society that makes them feel entitled to have power dominance and control over women supposedly men who batter are using violence to to maintain their individual and societal patriarchal dominance over women gt we still live in a sexist society where women are devalued where many men believe they are entitled to be in control in an intimate relationship and where men who batter believe they have the right to use violence while it is a goal to change the attitudes of men who batter the ultimate goal of the duluth model has always been to ensure that victims are safer by having the state intervene to stop the violence and address the power imbalance inherent in relationships where one person has been systematically dominated and subjugated by another vawa now the largest feminist foundation and it s associated legal foundations who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal family violence prevention and services act of with the obscenely gendered violence against women act vawa of the passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than passages just because they were male get more information about duluth model and vawa in this amazing post by u problem redditor conclusion it s important to recognize men as victims of domestic violence therefor i m leaving a list of dv sexual assault resources for men many run by mra s themselves feminism isn t the only cause behind this cultural epidemic this is a societal problem that goes back centuries but they have played a factor in recent decades on hindering dv rates and making it appear women are primary victims they do this by reporting on hospital and police records instead of self reported victims and perpetrators which is the most accurate way of determining accurate statistics even then it would probably be underestimating male victims in fear of ridicule men aren t as likely to recognize themselves as victims so if a survey question is something like have you ever been victim to domestic violence in your lifetime they likely won t report a positive response even though they have under the definition it s also a fact that women tend to lie about their victimization more than men therefor hindering the rates
10580,here is the link to the full commentary made by howe in response to the aap s american academy of pediatrics policy on male circumcision i came across this when researching claims made by an opponent in the unpopular opinion subreddit yesterday where the discussion was focussed on the merits or lack thereof of circumcision specifically male circumcision you can follow my discussion there which starts here and then ends with two different commenters here and here although as of now the thread has been locked if the other commenter replies to me directly in messages i will post his responses here later below is the body of what howe comments all citations in the linked article above gt in the last eleven months pediatrics has published three commentaries highly critical of the position held by the american academy of pediatrics aap in regard to infant male circumcision the content of the commentaries is redundant and the opinions expressed are based on a selective bibliography and other like minded opinion pieces while opinions can fuel productive debate the policies and recommendations that result from debate should be evidence based that should mean based on all the evidence gt gt the task force report gt gt i agree with the commentators that the aap task force on circumcision report had deficiencies the report ignored some evidence included methodologically weak references and took positions inconsistent with other policy statements of the aap and other national organizations gt gt neonatal anesthesia in the aap recommended that when administering anesthetic agents to newborns the decision to withhold such medication should be based on the same medical criteria used for older patients older children or adults are circumcised under general anesthetic supplemented with a caudal or penile block for post operative pain relief based on this aap policy newborns should be circumcised using general anesthesia however the risks of general anesthesia are greater for a newborn and not warranted for an elective procedure the australasian association of paediatric surgeons recommends delaying circumcision until general anesthesia is a safer option gt gt some have argued that the newborn period is the optimal time to circumcise while topical and local anesthetics reduce the pain of the procedure the rise in cortisol from baseline levels with these agents indicates that the procedure is still quite stressful and painful two studies have attempted to perform circumcisions in adults using emla alone both were abandoned early because of the clear lack of efficacy the financial savings of performing a circumcision on a newborn is offset ethically by providing an inadequate anesthetic gt gt restraints most infant circumcisions are performed using a restraining mechanism the most common method uses four point restraints this procedure violates the joint commission on hospital accreditation and federal guidelines on restraints while the guidelines have an exception to protect pediatric surgical sites this would apply to the post operative period waiting until the child was old enough to tolerate general anesthetic would avoid this conflict circumcision is not performed in older infants because they cannot easily be strapped down and are very vocal parents and ancillary staff would also strongly object gt gt there is little evidence that the benefits of circumcision would be diminished if the operation was delayed until puberty doing so would greatly reduce the incidence of complications since penis would be mature size the foreskin would be not be torn away from the glans and the procedure would be less painful given that full anesthesia and postoperative analgesia would be available female circumcision the aap opposes all forms of female genital mutilation this includes forms that are less invasive and less harmful than male circumcision the parallels between male and female circumcision on a cultural level are multiple and not coincidental evidence is accumulating that female genital alterations may result in medical benefits such as the significant shortening of the second stage of labor and a reduction in the risk for hiv infection consequently the aap may need to readdress their position on female cutting or bring their position on male cutting into line this is not to suggest that i advocate female circumcision but rather to highlight the gender discrepancies gt gt breastfeeding the aap acknowledges that breastfeeding reduces the risk of urinary tract infections in infants yet the task force failed to acknowledge the evidence that circumcision interferes with early breastfeeding this may explain why male infants are more likely to have higher bilirubin levels than female infants informed consent the aap committee on bioethics issued a statement regarding informed consent parental permission and assent in pediatric practice in because newborns do not have the capacity to give informed consent proxy consent is sought from parents or guardians in the statement the committee stated that proxy consent can only be given in situations of medical necessity such as disease trauma or deformity the healthy newborn male has a foreskin that is without disease trauma or deformity the task force concluded that circumcision was not medically necessary therefore as a matter of simple logic proxy consent is not valid the statement goes on to say that for non essential treatments that can be deferred without loss of efficacy they should wait until the child s consent can be obtained around years of age clearly male circumcision fits this description instead the task force left the choice up to the parents thus abandoning the obligation of the physicians to protect their patients from unnecessary procedures this recommendation runs contrary to well established bioethical and legal principles and certainly out of step with an evolved human rights culture for example the international covenant on civil and political rights ratified by the us senate on june provides every american even minors with a right to security of person and the freedom from cruel inhumane or degrading treatment gt gt to be consistent with other aap policies either the policy on circumcision needs to be altered in a manner reflecting their other policies or the other policies need to be revised and explicitly mention newborn circumcision as an exception gt gt complication rate finally the task force report stated that the complication rate was between and the first figure was from a typographical error in the abstract of a study that had a complication rate of the second figure was from a letter to the editor that was never subjected to peer review in studies based on actual chart reviews not merely databases the immediate complication rate is to by underreporting the complication rate by fold the task force did those physicians providing care of newborns a disservice gt gt going to source materials each of the recent commentaries cites the marked decrease of a variety of conditions provided by infant circumcision without providing any evidence other than each other s opinion pieces this is not acceptable gt gt penile inflammation only three populations of children have been studied regarding the risk of penile inflammation related to circumcision status none found a marked decrease in circumcised boys two found that circumcised boys under three years of age were at greater risk this topic has not been well studied in adults gt gt phimosis the incidence of pathologic phimosis in noncircumcised boys is by a boy s fifteenth birthday and rarely occurs in the first five years of life the most common cause is balanitis xerotica obliterans bxo the incidence of preputial stenosis in which the glans of the penis cannot be extruded as the result of a narrow circumcision scar is about to there are only four populations in which the risk of phimosis was compared by circumcision status none found a statistically significant difference gt gt paraphimosis the incidence of paraphimosis is unknown and rare of males referred for non retractile foreskins in children it is nearly always iatrogenic and simple reduction is sufficient to prevent recurrence the incidence of pseudoparaphimosis from a retained plastibell is between and in circumcisions using a plastibell the risk of paraphimosis appears to be lower than this but there are no comparison data gt gt dermatosis there is only one study that compared the rate of penile dermatosis in adult males based on circumcision status these were british men referred to a dermatologist the study suffers from an obvious referral bias and a control group with a circumcision rate in a country with a circumcision rate gt gt new information since the task force report urinary tract infections utis recent studies on utis should change the way we think about them the advent of prenatal ultrasound has revealed that males have a propensity for prenatal urinary tract anomalies primarily vesicouretaral reflux vur most vur resolves spontaneously however some males with more severe prenatal vur have associated kidney damage in the era prior to routine prenatal ultrasounds vur would be diagnosed accompanying a uti and the renal damage would be wrongly attributed to the uti the whole paradigm of vur as a factor in renal scarring has been called into question and boys with vur are more likely to see spontaneous resolution than girls with vur there is no evidence of an association between circumcision status and vur gt gt with the advent of nuclear renal imaging the clinical signs of pyelonephritis are not as directly associated with renal damage as previously thought there is no link between renal damage and circumcision status evidence has also accumulated that infection is rarely a cause of end stage renal disease in follow up studies children with utis renal scarring and primary uncomplicated vur did not develop hypertension finally one study found that these infections can be successfully treated with oral antibiotics the connection between urinary tract infections in noncircumcised boys and subsequent serious renal sequelae if it indeed exists at all has never been proven a meta analysis of the association of circumcision and uti found that the risk of having a foreskin is lower than previously advertised placing it in a range that could be explained all or in part by confounding factors female infants have a higher rate of utis which are treated with appropriate antibiotics instead of surgery gt gt community acquired staphylococcus aureus ca mrsa it was first documented in that circumcised infants were more prone to staphylococcal infections this was confirmed by two additional studies recently this has taken an interesting twist with several reports of outbreaks of ca mrsa in newborn nurseries these infections are almost exclusively in boys with the lesions primarily in the pubic area circumcised infants are at times the risk for ca mrsa gt gt sexual function until the last few years the impact of circumcision on sexual function had not been studied while it was known that the ridged band of the prepuce contained nearly all of the fine touch neuroreceptors in the penis and this structure was completely removed by circumcision the impact on physiology was unknown there have been several small studies that have surveyed men who were circumcised as adults for medical indications to determine the difference in sexual issues following the surgery while surgery was intended to correct their medical problem a substantial number of these men failed to improve or worsened sexually there were reports of increases in erectile dysfunction loss of sensitivity and problems with intromission following the procedure these studies suffered from small sample sizes poor response rates using subjective measures and short follow up periods gt gt three studies have used objective measures of the penis one study was underpowered and found no differences one study of men referred to urology both with and without erectile dysfunction measuring fine pressure thresholds on three locations found noncircumcised men were more sensitive but the differences were no longer statistically significant when adjusted for age diabetes mellitus and hypertension in a study of men taken from the general population without diabetes or erectile dysfunction fine pressure thresholds were measured on to locations on the penis the circumcision scar was the most sensitive portion of the circumcised penis whereas the most sensitive portion of the intact penis was the portion removed by circumcision and the glans of the intact penis was more sensitive than the glans of the circumcised penis gt gt penile cancer there have been two new case controlled studies of the risk factors associated with penile cancer both found that having phimosis rather than just having a foreskin was the principal risk factor this is consistent with growing evidence of a link between bxo and penile cancer slightly more than half of the penile cancers are attributed to human papillomavirus hpv so bxo may account for the rest of course removing tissue decreases the ability to develop cancer in that tissue thereby giving the appearance of a decreased incidence of cancer or disease for example if every boy had his left testicle removed at birth the rate of testicular cancer would be expected to decrease by more than half cervical cancer a new study found a trend toward a greater risk of cervical cancer in women with noncircumcised male partners but the results were not statistically significant placed within the context of the previously published studies the aap would be justified in dismissing this topic again hopefully the hpv vaccine will make discussions of penile and cervical cancer as irrelevant as blood letting for fevers gt gt hpv there are several new studies on the correlation of circumcision status and hpv infections several have problems with sampling bias small numbers and misclassification bias when incorporated into a meta analysis there is no statistically significant association the only new study in the united states found no difference in risk gt gt sexually transmitted diseases stds a meta analysis found syphilis and chancroid to be more common in noncircumcised men primarily in africa they found no statistically significant difference in seropositivity for herpes simplex virus type hsv two subsequent studies of hsv have confirmed this another meta analysis suggests that circumcised men are at greater risk for sexually transmitted urethritis the commentaries published recently in pediatrics make much of the recent new zealand study suggesting that noncircumcised men are at greater overall risk for stds the commentators failed to review the literature if they had they would have found the eleven studies that have failed to confirm this finding and actually indicate that circumcised men are at overall greater risk for acquiring an std more importantly recently completed randomized controlled trials rcts from africa are expected to report that other than clinical genital ulcerative disease circumcision had no significant impact on syphilis herpes simplex virus type serology gonorrhea or chlamydia the reality ignored by the previous commentaries is that these stds are avoidable by observing prudence in sexual contacts and behavior and easily curable with antibiotics permanently altering the genitals is out of all proportion to the danger posed by these infections gt gt hiv three rcts in africa were recently halted prior to their completion because they found african men with foreskins were at greater risk of contracting hiv infection although these were rcts they have serious problems it was impossible to blind the subjects so the study could have expectation bias the study began when subjects randomized to the circumcision arm were circumcised but the treatment arm was instructed to abstain from sexual contact while the circumcision healed whereas the men in the control arm continued to be sexually active thus introducing a lead time bias that would only be amplified by early termination of the trial early termination is more likely to result in an overestimate of the treatment effect the studies also suffered from attrition bias length bias no long term follow up is planned and selection bias only men interested in circumcision were included there were ethical concerns regarding the trials and the subjects may have been financially coerced by being offered a free circumcision money equivalent to two weeks worth of employment unlimited access to free condoms and free health care for to months gt gt instituting a circumcision program will not benefit africa let alone the united states a safe circumcision is not readily available in africa one african study found a complication rate with having had part of the glans amputated another study found that boys circumcised before they became sexually active had greater risk for hiv circumcisions performed outside the medical system in africa could result in more deaths than the procedure has been speculated to prevent being circumcised may give men the mistaken message that they no longer need to use condoms or practice safe sex this could lead to an increase in hiv infection more importantly the resources used to circumcise will not be available for other less expensive more effective prevention strategies for example for the cost of one circumcision in africa condoms can be purchased while some outside of africa consider the results of the rcts compelling public health officials in africa recognize that circumcision is less effective and more expensive than what is currently available and would take resources away from these effective measures applying the results to infants in united states is even more problematic these studies were done on adults to date there is no evidence that infant circumcision prevents hiv infection infants and children are at very low risk for sexually transmitted hiv and by the time today s newborns begin having sexual contact a vaccine or more effective anti retrovirals may be available the united states has a much lower rate of hiv than in countries in africa the strain of hiv infecting people in africa is different than the strain found in the u s most of the hiv infections in the united states are in men having sex with men msm while presumably the african epidemic is among men having sex with women msw in the united states it is claimed that the cases of hiv from msw accounts for only of the cases gt gt the sexual mixing patterns in the united states in general are different from africa and may be responsible for driving the epidemic in africa when the various factors that account for the spread of hiv infection behavior components are responsible for more than of the risk consequently the focus of preventions should be on the behavioral factors gt gt one of the major deficiencies in advocating circumcision as a preventive for hiv infection is the lack of biological plausibility circumcision proponents have repeatedly claimed that the inner lining of the foreskin is more susceptible to abrasion that the subpreputial space acts as a breeding ground for sexually transmitted viruses and that the inner foreskin is rich in langerhans cells which are responsible for transmission of hiv there is no scientific evidence that the inner lining of the foreskin is more susceptible to abrasion as the only study to address this issue found a trend toward circumcised men having more penile abrasions as mentioned above the incidence of the two sexually transmitted viruses hpv and hsv are not affected by circumcision status the role of langerhans cells in the transmission of hiv has been called into question by a recent study that found that langerin a c type lectin specifically expressed by langerhans cells interferes with hiv transmission and inhibited t cell infection it was only when the langerhans cells were overwhelmed by a high viral count that infection occurred if langerhans cells were not present infection rates would be higher aggressive treatment of stds in africa has been shown to be more effective and less expensive than circumcision gt gt the united states has an incidence of hiv that is several fold higher than the incidence in europe and japan but many times lower than that seen in sub saharan africa we also have the distinction of having the highest rates of circumcision among western nations among ethnic groups in the u s blacks have the highest rates of heterosexually transmitted hiv and have circumcision rates similar to white non hispanics hispanics have the lowest rate of circumcision and a rate of hiv infection between that of blacks and white non hispanics the us situation can be interpreted in one of two ways the first is that the circumcision experiment has already been performed in the u s and failed to impact the spread of hiv the second which is less likely is that without a highly circumcised population the hiv infection rate would be much greater regardless of the interpretation a couple of things remain clear our effort to contain the epidemic has been woefully ineffective and the positive impact of further increasing the rate of circumcision would be miniscule although there is no reason to believe that the results of the rcts would apply to the us population with our current rate of heterosexually transmitted hiv the number needed to treat would be to prevent one case of hiv if the cost per neonatal circumcision is then it would cost to prevent one case of hiv this could buy million condoms our resources would be far better spent adequately implementing the interventions we already have gt gt for the individual male if the is not spent on a neonatal circumcision and allowed to grow at per annum by years of age would be available by years this would be and by years this would amount to foregoing circumcision in the newborn period would allow the boy to keep his anatomy intact and make or condoms available to him respectively better still if we educate the boy properly and he follows a course of abstinence followed by fidelity he gets to keep his foreskin and the resources become available elsewhere gt gt when compared to other hiv preventives circumcision is much less effective and much more expensive than education condom use abstinence fidelity and aggressive surveillance and treatment of stds comparing the effectiveness of condoms to circumcision in preventing hiv is analogous to comparing the effectiveness of oral contraceptives to the rhythm method in preventing pregnancy at the very best circumcision may delay infection but it does not eliminate the risk instead of imposing circumcision on the infant without his consent give him a choice when he becomes sexually active take these condoms and use them every time you have sex or we will cut off the pleasure center of your genitals with this trade off not many teenagers will elect the surgical option gt gt there is a further danger that promoting circumcision will undercut the efforts to promote condom use this will happen in three ways first with the most sensitive portion of the penis removed condom use in a circumcised man reduces his pleasure even further this makes him less likely to use one consistently second condoms are more likely to slip off the circumcised penis third it will be nearly impossible to sell the idea that you still need to use a condom every time you have sex even if you are circumcised if consistent condom use is about effective what added value is there to being circumcised the only value in being circumcised is if you want to engage in high risk behavior without a condom this disinhibition will only increase the risk of disease transmission gt gt when all of the costs and health outcomes related to infant circumcision are combined in a cost utility analysis it was impossible even with assumptions most favorable to circumcision including a reduction in hiv risk to manipulate the numbers to make the practice preserve health or save money if the african numbers apply to the u s there is no evidence to support this assumption it would cost between million and million to avert one case of heterosexually transmitted hiv neonatal circumcision resulted in lifetime costs of per person and a reduction in health of quality adjusted life years per males gt gt summary gt gt the united states is addicted to circumcision much in the way the star bellied sneetches loved their stars over the past years circumcision has become so entrenched in our culture as a social norm that rational discussions of the topic are rare it is not clear whether the foreskin is amputated from blind adherence to tradition or a fear of nonconformity coupled with a complete discounting of the foreskin s contribution to the sexual pleasure of the male and his partner as a scientific organization i hope that the aap would consider newborn circumcision on its scientific merits and in the light of current standards of medical ethics and human rights thereby creating a policy that reflects these principles and that is consistent with its other policies we should not be in the business of being culture brokers as some circumcision proponents have suggested nor capitulate to political pressures rather we should stand for what is in the best interests of our patients welcoming a newborn into the world by cutting off part of his penis is not in his best interest
10986,the complicated case of women s oppression the feminist movement has been booming in kenya over the last few decades launching several campaigns and initiatives to bring about gender equality addressing a range of issues from female genital mutilation to domestic violence to sexual assault as a feminist and a woman myself i have heartily welcomed the various methods of undermining my oppression that feminism has afforded me and other kenyan women the first step to solving any problem is admitting that there is a problem and the second step is analyzing the problem why it exists what causes it and how to stop it if we apply this logic to the oppression of women then we must ask ourselves certain questions such as whether women are oppressed or not and how far reaching and severe is this oppression dear readers when you think of an oppressed class what comes to your mind a group of people that are denigrated and abused that are more impoverished than others that are subjected to violence with impunity are they punished more by the law and by society are they seen as less important than the oppressor class violence so with your vision of an oppressed class in mind do us women carry the characteristics of an oppressed class let s consider one characteristic which is that an oppressed class is subjected to more violence than the oppressor class or that the oppressor class themselves abuse or even persecute the oppressed class while it is an unfortunate truth that women do go through violence do they go through more violence than men according to childtrends org adolescent males were more likely to be the victims of assault than female adolescents according to the united nations office of drugs and crime of homicide victims in kenya are men globally of homicide victims are men in the uk men are almost twice as likely to be physically assaulted and murdered men are more likely to be victims of violent crime even when rape is included men are also more likely to be robbed according to gendercide org an independent organization monitoring gender based killings men and boys were specifically targeted in the rwandan genocide armenian genocide and the anfal campaign of in bosnia herzegovina in colombia east timor kashmir punjab the delhi massacre soviet prisoners of war pows among several others the male is born to be slaughtered kurdish proverb you most probably heard about the girls tragically kidnapped by boko haram but the vile terrorist organization has been massacring boys as far back as damaturu nigeria ap islamic militants set fire to a locked dormitory at a school in northern nigeria then shot and slit the throats of students who tried to escape through windows during a pre dawn attack tuesday at least students were killed including many who were burned alive they slaughtered them like sheep with machetes and gunned down those who ran away said one teacher adamu garba soldiers guarding a checkpoint near the coed government school were mysteriously withdrawn hours before it was targeted by the militants said the spokesman for the governor of northeastern yobe state female students were spared in the attack said the spokesman abdullahi bego though girls and women have been abducted in the past by militants of the boko haram movement whose name means western education is forbidden this time the insurgents went to the female dormitories and told the young women to go home get married and abandon the western education they said is anathema to islam bego said all of the dead were teenage boys or young men as of over boys have been abducted at the hands of boko haram mostly to be used as cannon fodder but i know what you are thinking that even though men are more likely to be killed and assaulted than women women still have domestic violence and rape to deal with while that unfortunately is true it should not be taken for granted that men are very much likely to go through these crimes as well according to kigaya of married men in kenya have been victims of domestic violence and of married men in kenya have been sexually abused by their wives according to lara stemple twenty one per cent of sri lankan males who were seen at a london torture treatment centre reported sexual abuse while in detention in el salvador of male political prisoners surveyed in the s described at least one incidence of sexual torture a study of concentration camp inmates in sarajevo found that of men reported having been raped according to stemple and meyer found that over of rape that occurs in prisons happens to male victims in the us men are as likely as women to be raped so even though women are an oppressed class we are less likely to be murdered or assaulted than men even as adolescents and we are less likely to be targeted by terrorist groups and foreign invaders but if men are the oppressor class violence against them would be taken more seriously and resources would be lavished upon them while female victims are ignored correct actually not really in nairobi there are several women s shelters but none for men fleeing domestic violence in the uk less than of domestic violence shelters are exclusively for male domestic victims in the us less than of domestic violence shelters are for men and none of them receive public funding out of all the organizations that recognize rape as a weapon of war less than offer services to male victims delzotto amp jones infact male victims of rape can be executed for homosexuality a crime in most african countries some may argue that the massive gap in resources afforded to female and male victims is simply because women are oppressed and are in greater need of resources and that crimes against us are socially acceptable while crimes against men are not however this is incorrect according to a study done by felson amp feld people were much more likely to call the police on a man hitting a woman especially if the woman was his wife than if the victim was a male the instance for which people were least likely to call the police was one in which a woman hit a man particularly if the man was her husband but if violence occurs more to men than women and women receive more resources than men and violence against women is taken more seriously than violence against men are women oppressed in this regard the law another feature of an oppressed class is that they are systematically oppressed and discriminated against by an oppressor class justice system so it stands to reason that women would be treated like second class citizens in courts and prisons but has this happened according to the world prison brief only of incarcerated persons in kenya are female but this alone does not indicate that the system is sexist since men commit more crime particularly violent crime than women however according to an extensive report by sonja starr men receive longer sentences for the same crime as women and women are more likely to be let off with a warning to avoid charges and convictions if arrested get released on bail and get acquitted than men women are also twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted women who killed their husbands got on average shorter sentences than men who killed their wives by ten years women are also more likely than men to have all charges against them dropped cassia amp spears furthermore criminals who committed violence against women receive harsher sentencing beaulieu amp messner out of fifteen of the world s longest prison sentences only one was handed to a woman who was released after eight years this says nothing of the disparities between male and female prisons since female prisons are significantly lower security and offer more freedom than male prisons it is no surprise that in the us women make up less than a miniscule of people on death row only women in the us have been executed in the last years in the us women are also times less likely to be killed by the police than men this trend of punishing males harsher than females doesn t start in adulthood according to lytton amp romney boys are physically punished more than girls by their parents and according to a report by human rights watch boys make up of those paddled in schools a father of two boys and a girl felt that it was more acceptable for boys to be paddled than girls he explained my little girl don t you put your hands on her as far as my boys i am super hard on them for one they are young black men and they are faced with different obstacles in life i get on them every day and i know they say man my dad is tough many interviewees reported that boys were beaten more harshly than girls a middle school boy in mississippi observed that one of his teachers paddle the boys real hard and when he paddle the girls he don t really hit them one student reported that there are smaller paddles for girls they use a short one for girls and a long one for the boys a violent education corporal punishment of children in us public schools human rights watch so in summary women are less likely to be victims of violent crime crime against women is taken more seriously than crimes against men more resources are afforded to female victims and men get harsher outcomes for their crimes than women particularly if their victim is a woman and even girls are less likely to be punished by their schools and parents than boys the economy another characteristic of oppressed classes is that they are often poorer and live in more despicable conditions than that of their oppressor so how do women and men stack up out of the homeless people in kenya are men which means men make up more than of the homeless population in the us of the homeless population are male according to a study by onyango suda and orwa nine out of ten street children are male but how are women doing when it comes to our money and wellbeing well here are the facts women control of all consumer spending of new homes of personal computers of vacations of food and of new cars infact women now control over trillion in annual consumer spending and that is set to increase to trillion in the next five years silverstein amp sayre if women are really so victimized and economically disadvantaged where are we getting this money from we shall see another characteristic of an oppressed class is that they are often forced to do dangerous overly laborious and unwanted jobs either through outright slavery or out of necessity applying this logic to women s oppression it should be the case that women do more difficult and dangerous jobs than men but men are times more likely to die at work than women are women also make up only of firefighters of construction workers and of police officers and less than of the world s military so in all the world s most dangerous and difficult jobs men make up the vast majority of workers including the majority of all protective and life saving jobs such as being of police officers over of the world s military and of firefighters but if women are systemically and economically discriminated against we would have to work longer hours than men just to survive however according to us census data men work hours more than women per week according to a study done by the resolution foundation men in the uk worked hours more than women per week this trend starts as early as years old where employed boys work more hours per week than girls according to data by the world bank in kenya of women are in part time employment but only of men are in part time employment women also retire earlier than men in several countries so in summary while men might earn more than women men are almost much more likely to die on the job than women are much more likely to be homeless more likely to live on the street from a young age work longer hours per week than women in more dangerous and undesirable jobs and retire later in several countries despite this women drive almost all consumer purchasing are women economically oppressed you decide health amp happiness another characteristic of an oppressed class is that they will usually have poorer health conditions and will most likely die earlier than the oppressor class either due to their lower quality of life increased victimization rate less accessible to hospitals or a combination of all three so it stands to reason that women will be generally unhealthier and live shorter lives than men according to the world bank kenyan men s life expectancy was years while women s life expectancy was years a five year gap in favor of women women outlive men in almost every country on earth it s no accident either women s health receives over four times as much funding as men s health men are more likely to die from heart attacks cancer and are more likely to have high blood pressure than women despite this women visit the doctor more than men males dying more than females begins at birth according to macdorman amp kirmeyer fetal death is higher in boys than in girls this trend continues throughout life because by their first birthday more boys than girls die mathews amp macdorman according to data provided by the world bank mortality rates for female infants was also lower than for male infants in kenya and mortality rate for adult women was much lower than mortality rate for men men also commit suicide far more than women out of suicides only were women in central kenya the situation is even more skewed with of suicide victims being male despite this women are more likely than men to go to therapy and take mental health medication infact men were more likely to die from a lot of different things not just suicide overally men die from injuries much more often than women of drowning victims are male males are twice as likely to die in a car crash than females men are more than twice as likely to die of a drug overdose and over times as likely to die from firearms in fact even though many people focus on the effect coronavirus has on women men are much more likely to die from coronavirus than women another characteristic of an oppressed class is that their lives are generally harder and more tragic than that of the oppressor and the oppressor s ill treatment of them might be the cause of their troubles but we have already seen that women enjoy a longer life and are less likely to commit suicide than men but are men the oppressor class happier than women according to data from the gallup world poll from women in kenya actually reported higher levels of life satisfaction than men by almost infact in the majority of countries in the world women rated higher rates of life satisfaction in summary women live longer healthier lives than men are more likely to visit a doctor and therapist are less likely to commit suicide or die accidentally and report higher levels of life satisfaction in addition women s health issues are funded much more than men s women are the only oppressed class in history to live longer live healthier and report higher levels of life satisfaction than their oppressor class women are the only oppressed class that are less likely to be victims of violent crimes and are systemically advantageous in all areas of the justice system women are the only oppressed class where violence against us is taken more seriously than violence against the oppressor class to the point that a member of the oppressor class will receive harsher prison sentences if their victims is a member of the oppressed class women are the only oppressed class to commit less suicide are less likely to be homeless and control a majority of the world s spending if men wanted to oppress us they are the most incompetent oppressors of all time and if there is one thing that men aren t it is incompetent but we must ask ourselves do men actually want to oppress women in almost all societies of the world men have gone to war leaving women and children in their homes specifically so they could protect women and children according to the birkenhead drill women and children are to be taken care of first in the case of a maritime disaster in almost all societies of the world men have especially taken up the most dangerous and difficult jobs for the benefit of women and children all the world s buildings and almost all the roads were built by men almost all firefighters and police officers protecting the general population are male men work more hours a week than women and often choose the most demanding but higher paying jobs such as being petroleum engineers or cardiologists while women choose more fulfilling and more flexible careers such as being teachers men then spend on and give their earnings to women and our children which is why women are now driving the world s economy even in foreign countries where conditions are very oppressive many men still work to provide for their families according to one of the workers they just become helpers and are badly paid many just end up accepting it as they cannot go back to their home countries because they are supporting their families i am sending money back to my family they are all looking to me but i can t tell them what it is like here or they would tell me to come home women are the only oppressed class to be protected by clothed fed taken care of loved and sacrificed for by their oppressors culture if men really hated women so much why would they dedicate their whole lives to providing for and protecting us a straight man will base his future on how much money he will make since he has the obligation to be a husband and father he will slowly leave behind his passion for art history or creative writing and choose a less fulfilling less comfortable job with better pay he will commute longer work more hours and take less vacations because he has or will have a family to provide for when he finds a girl he likes he will have to cajole her with dates and gifts and eventually he will have to purchase an engagement ring for her in many cultures he will have to provide a dowry brideservice or both let us consider one example the kikuyu tribe is the largest tribe in kenya according to kikuyu traditions after a man proposes to a woman usually with a diamond ring that he purchased himself in modern society him and his family visit his fiancee s home in a visit known as kumenya mucii where the groom and his family must provide gifts such as cash or animals and also bear all the expenses of the visit such as the food and drinks for both families after this the groom has to pay kuracia or a part of the dowry payment which can include animals cash or assorted items for the father and the mother of the bride on the eve of the wedding the groom and his friends or family must come to the gate of the bride s house and ask to be let in the bride s female friends and family will ask for gifts from the groom before they let him in such as food or even money this is called kuhura hoti than the bride and some other women will cover themselves and the groom has to pick which of the women are his bride if he chooses incorrectly he will have to pay a fine this is called gucagura muka wake then when the actual wedding happens the groom and his family must pay for a portion of it it is important to note that paying dowry in kikuyu culture lasts a lifetime so after paying for several dates gifts the engagement ring a portion of the dowry various other payments throughout the engagement process gifts for the mother and father of the bride and a part of the wedding what does the groom get for all his efforts he gets to provide for the woman and any children she has for the rest of his life now don t get me wrong i am not writing this to say that the grooms are disadvantaged rather that it is very much their choice to do so and they are very happy to do all this for their future wife but if men hated women why would they go through all this just to please the women and their families nowhere in history has there been a ruling class working to afford diamonds they could give to the oppressed in hopes the oppressed would love them more dr warren farrell in the myth of male power what does the research say according to the moral machine experiment both men and women were more inclined to save women over men in almost all countries and territories in an experiment done both men and women were less likely to administer electric shocks to women than men taylor amp epstein in a more recent study boys from the age of showed more empathy for girls than they did for boys and they continued to show more empathy for females throughout their lives stuijfzand et al participants were more likely to push a man rather than a woman in front of a moving trolley and they were also more likely to pay more money to administer less pain to a woman men were shocked on average about times compared to for women foot thomson studies a and b in a study done to test people s empathy of participants chose to push a man instead of a woman in front of an oncoming trolley and one participant said in a utilitarian situation i value women and children over men participants were also asked who they would save first on a sinking ship and over of the participants said they would save a woman first feldmanhall et al several other studies show that people of both genders are more reluctant to hurt a woman than a man many people believe that women are seen as inferior to men and that women will be evaluated and regarded much more harshly than men but research actually points to the opposite according to eagly mladinic amp otto when participants were asked to evaluate all male and all female groups women were always rated more positively than men according to aidman amp carroll participants showed a preference for female attributes and speech but none for male attributes if people still think men hate women the science points to the opposite religion but what does god think of women much has been said of christianity s so called misogyny does the holy bible oppress women in genesis the lord says it is not good for the man to be alone i will make a helper suitable for him many besmirch this verse by comparing the status of helper to slave and saying that this oppresses women however the same word is used to describe god several times and is never used in a negative way eve was created because adam had weaknesses not because adam was superior women in the bible were not created to be slaves or to serve men but rather to be their equal companion but after the fall both adam and eve were punished and eve s punishment in genesis was this i will make your pains in childbearing very severe with painful labor you will give birth to children your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you this is another reason some people say christianity is misogynistic but is it first let us consider the first line god did not originate painful childbirth it was always uncomfortable he just multiplied it as a result of sin it also goes without saying that childbirth will take up only a tiny percentage of a woman s life in the second line it says that women will now give birth to children and even though it is part of eve s punishment having children is something that several women take much joy in and this is also acknowledged in the bible in psalms children are a gift from the lord they are a reward from him so women are actually being rewarded in the form of children the next two lines are very controversial and some believe that god is justifying abuse or oppression of women through these two lines but this is simply not the case in peter it says likewise husbands live with your wives in an understanding way showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel since they are heirs with you of the grace of life so that your prayers may not be hindered here men are instructed not to hurt or oppress their wives especially since women are more delicate than men otherwise their prayers will be hindered furthermore in ephesians it says husbands love your wives just as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her here husbands are commanded not just to love their wives but to sacrifice for us as well in ephesians to it says in this same way husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies he who loves his wife loves himself after all no one ever hated their own body but they feed and care for their body just as christ does the church here men are called upon to afford the same niceties they give to themselves to their wives and also feed and care for their wives in ephesians it says for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh this refers to the intimate and loving relationship between a man and a woman but also sets boundaries on how the man must treat the woman a man cannot beat rape or oppress himself and so he cannot do the same to his wife but many point to the concept of a wife s submission to her husband as misogynistic but the word submit is used several times in the bible and jesus christ himself while being equal with god submitted himself to god in phillipians christ jesus who although he existed in the form of god did not regard equality with god a thing to be grasped but emptied himself taking the form of a bond servant and being made in the likeness of men being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death even death on a cross it should also be noted that men are not allowed to shirk their responsibilities toward their wives as we see in timothy but if anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for members of his household he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever however a wife s submission to her husband is voluntary so to summarize eve s punishment is childbirth which lasts only a small percentage of a woman s life children which is a gift from god and makes women very happy and to submit to their husbands their husbands who must love sacrifice protect respect provide for and care for them lest their prayers be hindered not to forget men must also provide for the woman s children lest he be called worse than an unbeliever even in women s punishment men are implicated but what of adam s own punishment in genesis god decrees adam s punishment cursed is the ground because of you through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life it will produce thorns and thistles for you and you will eat the plants of the field by the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground since from it you were taken for dust you are and to dust you will return two things may stick out to you firstly that adam s punishment is about twice as long as eve s secondly in the third line it says that adam s punishment will last all the days of your life as compared to eve s punishment which only lasts as long as it takes a woman to give birth another reason that people say christianity is misogynistic is because all twelve of christ s apostles and christ himself were male and while that is true let us look at how these men were treated i don t even need to tell you how christ himself died paul was beheaded peter was crucified upside down andrew was crucified thomas was killed when four soldiers pierced him with their spears phillip was arrested and put to death matthew was stabbed to death bartholomew was flayed alive and then beheaded james was stoned and then clubbed to death simon the zealot was crucified matthais was burned alive john was exiled to the island of patmos and was cast into boiling oil in rome but managed to escape unharmed he is commonly considered the only apostle to die a natural death what does god think of subjecting women to such brutality well jesus christ personally prevented the stoning of a woman it seems even the lord almighty believes in treating women gently do women really carry the heavier burden in christianity to conclude women are less likely to be victims of violence than men and if we are victims of violence women receive more resources than men and violence against women is taken more seriously than violence against men and men get harsher outcomes for their crimes than women particularly if their victim is a woman even in childhood boys are punished more harshly both by their parents and by schools while men might earn more than women men are almost much more likely to die on the job than women are much more likely to be homeless more likely to live on the street from a young age work longer hours per week than women in more dangerous and undesirable jobs and retire later in several countries despite this women drive almost all consumer purchasing women live longer healthier lives than men are less likely to commit suicide and report higher levels of life satisfaction in addition women s health issues are funded much more than men s both genders express more reluctance to hurt women than men and both genders feel more empathy for females than males women benefit from cultural constructs which ensure men must buy us and our family gifts and after marriage provide for us and our children for the rest of their lives in the world s largest religion husbands must love sacrifice for protect provide for respect and care for their wives while women have to submit to their husbands and are blessed with children when us feminists refer to a patriarchy we usually think of a society in which women are reduced to the status of slaves and men are treated like kings where men hold a disproportionate amount of power and use that power to make their own lives better than ours but is that really what has happened dear reader i hope you are now convinced that men s lives are certainly not better than women s lives what of women s power do we hold any power in today s society while a majority of the world s governments are male women represent a larger class of voters than men in several countries in kenya there are more women than men and as we have seen so far even in a country with a male dominated government women are still afforded a bevy of privileges as stated before women now drive the world economy the power lies in not who earns the money but who spends it she who has the gold makes the rules there are now several industries marketing wholly or majorly to women so why am i saying all of this because i want to prove feminism is not needed because i want to prove that women are bad and men are good none of the above infact this is my love letter to women that you are loved and that the world does not hate you for being a woman that you are needed and wanted and protected feminism is still very much needed but we must change the narrative that there is a systemic hatred and violence toward women and start seeing it for what it is that women are seen as equally important or more important than men and that women are even protected more than men and criminals who hurt women are just that criminals who are seen as worse than criminals that hurt men i would also like to challenge the assumption that men hate women and use their power and strength to hurt and oppress women if statistics prove anything men mostly use their power and strength to protect and provide for women over other men
11885,why fathers can t be mothers and vice versa gt there is a well known phenomenon of a revolving door in graduate degrees that lead to demanding positions quite a few women with an md or a phd retire after graduation or several years later feminism describes this constant stream of women who have reached their thirties and forties as resulting from micro aggression allegedly directed at them in their work environment and creating according to the feminist narrative a glass ceiling designed to suppress the female sex but what such women are reporting is completely different most women experience children as self fulfillment while most men receive parallel mental fulfillment from their place on the social matrix the status that is from their position there are exceptions to this but the rule and the exception do not disqualify each other and now after we acknowledged the exceptions the non exceptional must also be acknowledged a man whose main achievement in life is raising children and a woman whose main achievement in life is a position on the human matrix will both find it difficult to see in that alone self realization here there is an immediate danger that readers who identify with feminism will revert to the feminist ad consequentiam argument which says if someone utters the truth about male and female drives this alone would prevent women from occupying positions therefore the drives don t exist however we didn t say that women cannot or should not have such roles the idea that this is what was stated is merely part of an argumentum ad consequentiam of thinking if we acknowledge the existence of human drives it might be an impact that we don t like and this impact was the intention of whoever admitted this not at all the fact noted above that women experience children as self realization while men receive parallel mental realization from their place on the social matrix is not leading to any of the consequences feminism is afraid of and admitting the above isn t coming out of any intention to prevent women from achieving anything it could have but it doesn t this is important not everything that could be true is in fact true most of what could be true isn t true your friend could be traveling to rome to get away from you but they re not they want to see rome the fact that something could be true is not evidence that it is true your boss could be complementing you just to make you unsuspecting while they try to get you fired but they re not they are simply happy with your work millions of men and women could say that children cause women self fulfillment while positions cause men self fulfillment to keep women down but they re not they are only expressing what they feel and know as humans this difference between the two sexes regarding what causes self fulfillment stems from innate sexuality women have an innate desire for children and there are exceptions acceptance of the exceptional person mustn t turn into disqualifying the vast majority women should not feel guilty about their desire for children or their view of children as an existential purpose and self fulfillment because this is not a product of social conditioning nor of male expectations but of innate female sexuality society should also refrain from instilling in women a sense that expressing an aspiration to have children or a desire to dedicate themselves to children is harmful for the status of women or a betrayal in feminism the desire for children is the deepest sexual urge in women and therefore any judgmental attitude toward it is the oppression of women in fact the female urge for children is similar in its intensity to the male urge toward women most of the magnitudes found in men s urges toward women are rarely found in women toward men but rather such magnitudes are seen in women toward babies and toddlers just as many men feel an almost uncontrollable urge to touch women many women feel an almost uncontrollable urge to touch babies while men find it difficult to even distinguish between babies women often see almost every baby as an endearing being as men feel toward almost every woman gt most women do not achieve satisfaction from positions that do give them status but at the same time make it difficult for them to bond with their children or even demand of them to avoid motherhood women see having children an existential purpose as men see in sex with women in the following simple sense a man who feels that there s a possibility that he will never have sex with any woman will have a feeling that there is no point to his life and most women who feel they may never have children will feel similarly that there is no content and purpose to their lives the opposite is not true in most people a man who feels that there s high probability he ll never have children will not reach the emotional extremity that the thought of never sleeping with a woman will cause and a woman who feels she would never sleep with a man would not usually reach the same emotional extremity that the thought of never having a child would cause all of these are not roles these are the innate female and male sexualities in many if not most of men the male sexuality sees children as something that must be given to a woman so that she would want to share her life with the man we must be committed to saying the truth and this is a human truth even if it sounds to a feminist too simplistic or even too ridiculous to be true much of actual human existence is indeed quite ridiculous men are interested in women children are for most men a price to pay to get women s consent to live together prior to having children men generally have no special interest in becoming parents rather they want women generally speaking it is only after having children that men fall in love with their children and this could remain limited to the children they are raising they generally don t develop special regard toward children in general as many women have much before having children this should not be taken as an assertion about what should be the human condition but as an innocuous observation familiar nearly to every living person about what humankind is and what the innate qualities of human beings are this is not to say that men do not love their children they are in love with them however only a small proportion of men regard raising children a goal in and of itself rather than a consequence of sharing their lives with women and many of the few who do see children as an existential goal are traditional men who think of children as a kind of small personal tribe that grants them power and status in a traditional society one of the consequences is that most women do not achieve satisfaction from positions that do give them status but at the same time make it difficult for them to bond with their children or even demand of them to avoid motherhood yes the exceptional person was recognized above all the others also deserve acknowledgment once in a while and here we are discussing them not the exception there is a well known phenomenon of a revolving door in graduate degrees that lead to demanding positions quite a few women with an md or a phd retire after graduation or several years later feminism describes this constant stream of women who have reached their thirties and forties as resulting from micro aggression allegedly directed at them in their work environment and creating according to the feminist narrative a glass ceiling designed to suppress the female sex but what such women are reporting is completely different for example dr georgia free a medical doctor rejected this narrative on her popular youtube channel when she explained how feminists march young women like herself into restricting positions saying dear teenage girls of the past and present i m sorry we lied to you we lied to you because we were lied to as well a former corporate executive similarly said on her vibrant youtube channel feminism is lying to you gt the feminist vision that male spouses of such women will take care of babies and function as mothers is not for the most part aware of the basic drive for motherhood of the women themselves as someone who knew quite a few women who left a position shortly after graduating to fulfill other aspirations one became a dancing teacher another a therapist yet another a healer the feminist description of environmental microaggressions forming a glass ceiling that supposedly turns the revolving door is simply not true they retire reporting sympathy toward them in the positions they held even exceptional and eager support to keep them there none of this being helpful in dealing with a sense of existential non realization a feeling that the position in and of itself as a place on the social matrix of status simply does not grant them any kind of existential realization these positions are significant primarily for the feminist spreadsheets to reach women somewhere not to most women save for the well acknowledged minority the same feminists who compile the grand spreadsheet of feminism by the way usually do not devote years of their life to isolating cells in a tube or to counting light spots under a prism in order to be imprisoned at the end of this academic training for or hours a day alone in a dark chamber with a microscope while regarding this an existential realization on the contrary they dedicate most of their life to self realization while sending other women to live this life to balance the spreadsheets for them the conclusions from everything written so far are many first it is necessary to allow women in senior or demanding positions to make time for children the feminist vision that male spouses of such women will take care of babies and function as mothers is not for the most part aware of the basic drive for motherhood of the women themselves second we must acknowledge that even after any possible social change most women will prefer positions that allow the private life to have more weight than work because the position itself simply does not grant most women a sense of existential fulfillment therefore women should not be tracked forcefully by feminist influence in education and culture into roles that typically have much more weight than one s private life only cultivated equally as men equal opportunity and not equity which amounts to tracking forcing and on the end of the equation of men discrimination along with equal nurturing and opportunities which are currently not lacking women should also be sufficiently informed to make a free choice about their life feminist coercive tracking is morally wrong equal cultivation and equal opportunity do not involve leading people without their knowledge into a reality that will cause them suffering society should reject the reflexive feminist criticism over every numerical difference when all other conditions are kept equal men should not be blamed for inclinations created by female sexuality and should not be attacked because of women s preferences that men did not create cannot influence and are not responsible for in fact blaming men for women s free choices that are entirely out of men s control is a pattern of an abusive relationship that formed between feminism and men society must not force women and men to act against mental desires just in order to satisfy some psychological need of a reclusive small faction to feel satisfaction from looking at a table in a spreadsheet that shows an arbitrary and forceful people are not someone s numbers people before tables gt the idea that both boys and girls can be cultivated in the same way for motherhood is similar to the idea that both a pigeon and a hen can be taught to fly provided they receive identical nurturing the different and complementing drives of men and women have an additional consequence the ability of men and women to take care of babies and toddlers has a different psychological significance in both for a woman who wanted children the caring involves emotional pleasure and satisfaction and a sense of self fulfillment and realization at least for a significant portion of the time for the man caring involves almost continuous self coercion and a feeling of non realization we have acknowledged exceptions above here the non exceptional receives much needed and seldomly held discussion women as well may feel non realization during childcare however this comes alongside satisfaction and fulfillment which is not the case for most men therefore equal participation in taking care of children does not create an equal emotional burden but before we contemplate about this ramification of differences between male and female sexuality why for men childcare involves almost continuous self coercion and thus greater mental sacrifice the human reality is the complete opposite of the gender church belief that by raising boys and girls exactly the same way identical adults will emerge which underlies the latest trend in the gender church raising girls and boys without gender identity the belief is that same cultivation in all areas results in sameness and this faith is implemented in particular with the intention of making boys able to provide maternal care for example by encouraging boys to play with dolls which is perceived as learning to provide care this reveals some ignorance regarding why girls play with dolls dolls are not used by girls primarily for practicing motherhood but for simulating social situations most probably because of an innate inclination toward social interaction and analysis in which women are proficient this is not a stereotype but a simple fact about humans with all due exceptions of course one can teach both boys and girls to become mothers and expect both to be equally good at this in adulthood however only girls have the innate infrastructure for doing two things develop into mothers in response to nurturing of motherhood and form a new neural infrastructure compatible with motherhood during childbirth only women have a second hormonal adolescence during pregnancy and childbirth that shapes the brain into the motherly behavior just as the first adolescence shaped the brains of both sexes to develop their sexualities the idea that both boys and girls can be cultivated in the same way for motherhood is similar to the idea that both a pigeon and a hen can be taught to fly provided they receive identical nurturing certainly the same taming can be done with both but only the pigeon has innate genetics awaiting this learning as an external stimulus that would lead to the development of the ability to fly while the hen was not born with an aviation program like the pigeon s so the same training to both will not produce two creatures with similar aviation abilities but rather one that flies and one that barely skips because they are genetically different they have different plans and if we still insist on creating out of a pigeon and a hen two creatures with equal flight capabilities it will definitely not be achieved with equal upbringing we will have to invest in the hen much more hours of intensive training to reach the very lowest levels of pigeon flight at most we will reach a kind of non violent gliding falling off an elevated throwing zone in the same way women are born with abilities that will allow them to be mothers that men are not born with identical up bringing of both sexes is not the creation of similar abilities because only one of them has a plan awaiting cultivation to develop and in the same way giving girls the enrichment that will cultivate their maternal abilities is not tracking them but merely allowing a potential inherent in most women to develop the result of these differences is that the mental challenge for a man who participates equally in childcare is not equal to the mental challenge of a woman who does the same thing just as the efforts of our hen to fly like a pigeon are not similar to the efforts the pigeon puts in flying with no disrespect to the enormous mental challenge that a woman faces in motherhood gt changing up bringing from infancy will not change the deep feelings beneath the extroverted behavior the fact that women experience children as self realization while men receive parallel mental realization from their place on the social matrix is not a result of some cultural programming perhaps in order to appreciate the type of mental challenge we are discussing here one needs to be aware that babies are not passive beings they are active assertive and demanding the cultural image of a baby is that one of a doll nothing could be further from the truth a baby is more similar to a ruler and most of the time not of the democratic type the demands requirements and needs of a baby proceed moment by moment day and night on weekdays and holidays in a continuous relentless minute by minute sequence that lasts several years until the age the baby becomes a toddler and the dependence gradually subsides because of that the baby s parent is required to deal with an almost unendurable amount of mental strain which not comparable to any other area in life to illustrate i was a soldier even in wartime i was a doctoral student who stayed in the lab for so long that he wasn t sure if it s day or night outside i was an employee required to work for hours straight and none of that came close to the stress that caring for my son had put me under when he was a baby before during and after my paternity leave this strain is experienced differently by most men compared to most women because regardless of any upbringing a man does not have equal abilities when he is required to provide equal childcare ti babies this means that in order to achieve a result equal to that of the woman he will need to put in much more effort to add to the man s fortune while a woman facing the same challenge has a feeling of existential self realization when providing care for most women at least some of the time women must be honest about this point and this provides a remedy for the difficulties the man does not feel self realization from taking care of babies but an existential non realization like that felt by a typical woman who devotes her life only to a position and thus he undergoes even more mental sacrifice in generating his equal share emotionally equality in care does not produce an equal mental burden finally on top of this increased mental burden something more is added today women who expect equal participation from men are guided by feminism to express their expectation with the familiar feminist contempt meaning by requiring men to participate equally without expecting any appreciation for it to make it clear to men that this is not a favor it s your duty and you are not receiving a cookie for fulfilling your obligations the term cookie comes directly from feminist discussions so while women are exalted for taking care of children alongside working the identical effort by a man dividing the day exactly like a working mother between work and babies doing both in the same proportions as the working wife as demanded by feminism is typically done under contempt cynicism and criticism men are thus put into an unsustainable emotional position that no person would accept let alone a feminist woman you will sacrifice yourself and you will be despised for it the fathers develop emotional distress sometimes suicidal thoughts and warn other men of entering a parental relationship changing up bringing from infancy will not change the deep feelings beneath the extroverted behavior the fact that women experience children as self realization while men receive parallel mental realization from their place on the social matrix is not a result of some cultural programming these differences are not created by education but from the differences between masculinity and femininity as two complementary types of innate sexuality men as a general rule cannot be mothers as women can equal cultivation from birth will never make them so and demanding them to nonetheless be identical to mothers will create a much more severe mental burden for them then the same care would impose on women this is not equality anymore than demanding all women to lift on a daily basis bags of sand beyond their muscle capacity is women are likewise not a substitute for fathers every parent knows that children are authoritative posing demands and applying almost every available means to dictate their months or months old will and that no household can function nor the basic needs of the baby fulfilled and health kept without the ability of the parents to guide and direct their children to actions and compliance with basic needs going to the bathroom eating dinner dressing up going to bed thus children require some sort and level of authority and this applies to the most liberal of households as well anyone telling you otherwise is lying probably to oneself more than to you they apply authority they say go come take and stop as any parent because there is no way around it as noted children would often resist caring and guidance few people know this before becoming parents most are not aware that this is the burden of parenting and here the importance of fathers comes into play men have a deeper louder voice a more massive figure an assertive attitude and project authority this could have been merely a stereotype but the reality is that it s not it is a simple property of human existence this male authoritativeness which can be provided in the most gentle and caring manner but would still be a distinctive projection of authority for a child is imperative for taking care of children it is the father s innate authority that defies the baby s dictating power and guides the baby and toddler to acceptance of the mother s requirements and requests mothers are rarely capable of providing the same authority without the exclusive care fathers add to the equation an ongoing conflict can arise again exhausting the woman more than it would have burden a man if women were to function as fathers for lack in means of driving the children into basic healthy and necessary functioning through manly authority they might resort to an emotional plead you are hurting your mother thus installing guilt as a motivational impetus rather than a psychology driven by seeking love and growth which can be emotionally exhausting for both parent and child and may be hypothesized to affect the child in the long run therefore mothers too cannot function as fathers both are needed for their unique innate qualities they are not interchangeable society should not require men to function as mothers only as fathers and my personal recommendation would be to encourage men to be active fathers and to closely help their wives help as opposed to being an identical copy of their wives as demanded in feminism society should likewise not mislead women about the ability of most women to function as fathers it should also refrain from tracking women into a life that would cause most of them existential suffering and regret and instead provide only equal cultivation and opportunity to choose any life they wish to have including working in a position that would not interfere with raising children even if this would appear in some spreadsheet as women and men not showing identical numbers in some specific position type society must accept the choices women make and not blame or shame anyone for these choices not the women themselves and certainly not men who have little to no control over women s choices and carry no blame for them originally published here
11956,vmmc stands for voluntary medical male circumcision it is a totally legitimate and totally medical procedure that is obviously done under informed consent according to research by researchers and governments who legitimately refer to themselves as the vmmc community in papers more than million of such totally consensual procedures had been carried out by with more than millon planned by and more than of the ones completed by having been payed for by gt the united states president s emergency plan for aids relief pepfar gt the vmmc program is an ambitious public health intervention while it is estimated that close to million circumcisions had been completed by the end of against a goal of million by this progress should be viewed within the context of the recent and rapidly developing understanding of the importance of vmmc as an hiv prevention intervention figure as you can see the reason for what researches refer to as the vmmc program is the belief that circumcision could prevent of female on male hiv contractions without having to provide education on safer sex practices or female and male condoms of course such a program is claimed to be implemented to help the people but the justification for choosing a method that as i will show later on inevitably lead to gruesome human rights violations was to save money the estimated savings were more than billion in treatment costs with the vmmc program wheighing in at only billion without demand creation obviously the created demand will be totally voluntary organic and gras fed gt furthermore the choice to be circumcised involves deep seated values beliefs and motivational factors that vary with ethnic religious and cultural identities and must be addressed effectively to generate demand for circumcision of course the surgeries are not the only nor the most effective way to prevent hiv but with almost billion in total savings it is the way to make the most money as vmmc is a one time procedure that provides continuous benefits without having to continuously invest into further adherence gt modeling studies done in showed that in these priority countries achieving circumcision prevalence among males aged within five years catch up and maintaining this coverage rate in subsequent years sustainability could avert million new hiv infections within years and generate treatment and care savings of us billion vmmc is a highly cost effective hiv prevention strategy for both generalized and high prevalence hiv epidemics it differs from most other prevention methods e g pre exposure prophylaxis sexual behavior change or condom use in that it only requires a one time action in order to provide continuous benefits gt a major limitation of the cost studies in this collection is that they do not include the costs of demand creation nor analyze how increased spending on demand creation might affect the actual demand for services gt the program faces increasing competition for declining funding for hiv prevention and treatment the funding need for vmmc remains significant and continued evidence based advocacy is necessary to secure funds for accelerated scale up from a broad base of donors one way to do this is to evaluate the population level impact of those vmmc programs that have already been scaled up another is to continue to draw comparisons between vmmc and other hiv prevention programs highlighting specifically that if vmmc coverage reaches the jsaf goal of it will prove the most cost effective and cost saving hiv prevention intervention in eastern and southern africa in addition it does not require sustained adherence and there is evidence that referrals made from the vmmc program increase hiv positive males access to treatment totally unfortunately though they are struggling to reach their goals gt despite the rapid implementation and scale up of vmmc programs and the doubling of the cumulative total vmmc procedures in the past year from million by the end of to an estimated million by the end of progress at the country level has varied widely figure and the year on year rate of growth in the number of vmmcs performed is declining figures and and this is due to a combination of factors the jsaf goal of reaching of uncircumcised men by did not fully take into account country specific constraints that have tempered the pace of scale up lack of sufficient demand and insufficient funding from a broad base of international donors the united states president s emergency plan for aids relief pepfar has funded more than of circumcisions to date modeling suggests that even if the current growth rate is maintained and adequate funds are forthcoming the number of vmmcs completed by would fall about million short of the jsaf goal of million figure so what do you do what is this demand creation let s see gt demand creation messaging must be tailored to different age groups and to the cultural norms of different communities men aged and above are less motivated to undergo vmmc studies suggest that we need to go beyond simple hiv messaging and present vmmc in terms of hygiene appearance attractiveness to partners peer group norms and modernity in other terms stigmatize being uncurcumcized as ugly dirty and unattractive incite bullying make them self conscious and ultimately psychologically break them into totally voluntarily undergoing the assault surgery i mean they totally look at the human and their needs as victims of coercion users gt while a large portion of this collection focuses on surgical efficiency or quality the bigger challenge is overall programmatic efficiency the challenge of scale up can be approached as a management challenge that requires addressing each element of the delivery value chain the specific activities that deliver the end product to the user using time and resources appropriately and matching supply with demand for vmmc services while working to increase both gt the cost of circumcision devices and other supply chain costs must be brought down considerably if devices are to reduce overall program costs this will require advocacy as well as negotiation with manufacturers and suppliers in tandem with demand creation activities we recommend further study to ascertain whether devices make circumcision more attractive to men and to understand whether devices could assist with balancing supply and demand to help achieve needed programmatic efficiencies it is also important to tailor demand creation activities for devices in order to reach those who may already be aware of circumcision s benefits but who have avoided conventional surgical methods gt to date little research has looked at the male population as a market of consumers of an intervention with multiple benefits a market research approach along with insights from diverse fields such as behavioral economics and anthropology can provide new tools to inform the development of new approaches more funding should be allocated to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the many approaches to creating and mobilizing demand those that show positive results should be taken to scale by now by the way we are in the next stage and already target boys down to the age of and below as i will show later on gt it is important to begin strategizing for the sustainability phase that should follow the present catch up activities it will take time to determine the best approach to sustaining high mc prevalence in each country develop global and national frameworks secure resources and implement long term programs since the cohorts prioritized in the sustainability phase will likely be some combination of uncircumcised boys aged years and infants aged days it will also be important to explore how best to reach young adolescents and parents of infants taking into account impact cost the feasibility of scale up cultural acceptability and other factors so let s look at some actual approaches for coercing promoting mutilation demand gt voluntary medical male circumcision vmmc programs in africa have significantly altered social norms related to male circumcision among previously non circumcising groups and groups that have practiced traditional non medical circumcision one consequence of this change is the stigmatization of males who for whatever reason remain uncircumcised this paper discusses the ethics of stigma with regard to uncircumcised adolescent males in global vmmc programs particularly in certain recruitment demand creation and social norm interventions grounded in our own experiences gained while conducting hiv related ethics research with adolescents in kenya we argue that use of explicit or implicit stigma to increase the number of vmmc volunteers is unethical from a public health ethics perspective particularly in campaigns that leverage social norms of masculinity gt the objective of this study was to explore norms of masculinity and the decision making process among luo young men to provide a better understanding of how circumcision and masculinity relate to cultural norms within this community the methodology consisted of eight fgds with male peer groups and in depth interviews to elicit young men s perceptions of masculinity and voluntary medical male circumcision findings from thematic analysis reveal that young men described several key characteristics of masculinity including responsibility bravery and sexual attractiveness for some young men voluntary medical male circumcision has embedded itself into cultural norms of masculinity by being a step in the transition from boyhood to manhood and by being a marker of some of these masculine characteristics in the case of voluntary medical male circumcision there may be opportunities to integrate other programming that helps men transition into healthy adulthood gt there is a need to identify key barriers and facilitators to vmmc uptake in priority countries to improve uptake in this paper we report findings from a systematic review of the barriers and facilitators of vmmc uptake comparing them across countries in order to provide programmers critical information to design effective vmmc uptake interventions our review followed prisma protocol twenty three articles from of the priority countries were included the top three barriers cited were mc negatively perceived as being practiced by other or foreign cultures and religions fear of pain caused by the procedure and perceptions of vmmc as not helpful needed the top four facilitators cited in most countries were belief that vmmc reduces health risks and improves hygiene family and peer support of mc and enhanced sexual performance and satisfaction note that peer support and peer educators are very euphemistic terms given what they actually describe gt many circumcised respondents especially the younger men relayed stories of peer influence in their decision to get circumcised gt there was a friend of mine who had decided to go for circumcision and told me let s go and circumcise how can we continue like this and let other people ridicule us the fear of ridicule from age mates already circumcised influenced our decision circumcised man age gt similarly some uncircumcised men in the more peri urban areas said they would be more likely to go for the cut if their peers had been circumcised social network influences on vmmc uptake are relatively unexplored although the use of peer educators is widespread in vmmc programming studies with these populations have exposed numerous problems for example the fact that the victims clients have to be turned in by certain groups of mobilizers and peer educators for them to collect money that was put on their heads gt for mobilizers especially monthly remuneration and their future employment depends on referring enough clients to the clinic each week failing means earning less regardless of the amount of time and effort invested in mobilization from our interviews we learned that while most mobilization supervisors receive a base salary from their ips regardless of the targets other lower level subcontracted associate mobilizers or peer educators only receive payment by providing clients and meeting targets this and following quotes without links are from here one mobilization supervisor said gt and you know when there are zero clients cut all the pressure comes to the mobilization supervisor because the surgeons will be saying we are ready to cut where are the clients so the buck stops on me as the mobilizer so it is not a very easy task another gt likewise a year old female mobilization supervisor offered we bank on schools so much and now when they are taking their exams you can t pick a child from school when schools are so engaged then definitely i will not meet that target mobilizer the pressure to meet targets leads to numerous ways of coercing pushing or otherwise making people undergo the procedure gt data collected during interviews and observations suggest that the drive to meet targets may lead some vmmc mobilizers to use misleading or otherwise questionable mobilization practices to increase the number of adolescents they can refer for circumcision as mobilizer explained another thing is the peer mobilizers yeah someone wants to meet his or her targets and that is the time that they engage in what i called the uncouth methods whereby the end justifies the means whichever means that can make those clients come out so you end up having the clients coming but they are not coming for the vmmc the way we want it they have been pushed they have been coerced yeah this one is happening because of these targets so that is the downside of the targets these practices are sometimes blatant during one door to door village mobilization the mobilizer kept referring to himself as doctor although he had no medical training another mobilizer a year old male who referred to himself as a vmmc champion explained how he pays boys to help him mobilize their friends for us we are calling it broking brokering system so after the exercise you tell him to go and convince a friend and bring a friend for me i am using my own system being that we are not even allowed to give children money but for me because i have a target and if i get my target i am expecting kes usd so i do divide this kes maybe if he brings me two boys i can give him up to kes i can even give out kes usd the moment i give that money bob to that boy he is going to bring me more four boys so the more he bring boys for instance if they are four i give kes at the end of the day i will hit my target mobilizer they also perform skits in which they try to stigmatize foreskin gt other times these practices are subtle and easy to overlook during a promotional skit in which mobilizers played the roles of a husband wife and brother all discussing vmmc the message to the audience was one of strong female preference for circumcised men the wife told her husband go and cut your firimbi whistle go and remove that sleeve of a sweater that whistle is not going inside me don t blow the whistle inside me i have refused i am not giving you sex later when the husband s brother arrived he explained that his wife is refusing to have sex in response his brother said i was passing here to tell you to go for circumcision look at me i have gone and i am fine i am now a clean person explaining the benefits his brother offered that mc reduces hiv risk by and enhances cleanliness you avoid smelling and prevents cervical cancer that being said i want to explicitly distance myself from the author s statements claiming this to be subtle and even framing it as merely unbalanced humor later on gt while we recognize that the promotional skits used during vmmc roadshows use humor and dramatize promotional messages to accentuate the positive greater efforts should be made to ensure that this messaging is balanced so that benefits and risks are neither over or understated for similar reasons the practice of public health workers persuading boys to become circumcised by claiming that their future female partners will definitely prefer them that way and reject them if they are not should be questioned if not discouraged i strongly disagree as long as uncircumcised men are in any way stigmatized the resulting willingness to undergo such a prcedure may not actually be based on personal preferences rather than an attempt to avoid social sanctions in fact the abovementioned alterations of social norms may act as a coercive force even if these practices were completely abandoned let alone only balanced it doesn t surprise me though given that according to netflix telling men with small dicks to go kill themselves already is balanced humor outsourcing the coercion to peers does not change the inherent conflicts associated with not wanting to get circumcised whilst not wanting to get bullied or even attacked for being incorrectly held responsible for all hiv infections that will inevitably occur until education and supply of proper prevention methods is ensured you can stop claiming to be a doctor you can stop using material incentives to persuade those who are easy to manipulate but you can t just revert the social changes and misinformation as shown later only uncircumcised men contract hiv the only prevention method is circumcision which induce the creation of pressure by people whom you have no control over the damage is done and may be irreversible another way of coercion is paying them with food and clothing gt according to interviewees food money water sanitation clothing and other basic needs are issues of concern for many adolescents households during health talks some mobilizers emphasized the incentives that boys will receive e g sodas and or new underwear following circumcision items that may be significant inducements among impoverished children during a village mobilization effort one mother explained her reluctance to let her son be circumcised this one is small even his heart was there because those who have come from circumcision are seducing their friends to go also they are telling them go and it is not painful op remember boys are paid to seduce their friends they are also giving people sodas so that soda is what brings them nearer i told this boy not to sneak but to wait and i will take him there offering a similar analysis provider told us sometimes they also entice them for us in the facility we give them a bottle of soda fanta to be specific because one some of the boys come probably from poor families they haven t had a meal in the morning or breakfast and sometimes stay in the clinic for more than two hours three hours and thus to maintain their sugars but that one soda becomes a bait especially for the young ones we will give you a soda we pick you with a vehicle which is actually wrong because it is like enticing a client which you are not supposed to but that is how they mobilizers ply their trade however according to our interviewees and as we observed first hand clinics sometimes lack sodas and or underwear to give to clients a common theme here is the incitation of social stigma and peer pressure gt all six of the teachers we interviewed recognized social pressure as a primary motivator for mc among adolescents during observations of mobilization activities we saw firsthand how mobilizers sometimes make use of or encourage peer pressure to promote circumcision including through the use of abusive and or stigmatizing language during a health talk in front of a large group of boys at a primary school one male mobilizer referred to foreskins as the sleeve of a sweater and cold matumbo boiled goat intestines at the end of the talk he implored those who still had their whistles to have them removed he also told them those who are still having the foreskin you are the ones who are going to spread the diseases in the future you are the ones who are going to spread the hiv virus later that same day the mobilizer asked a large group of older students how many of you wish to get the hiv virus if you don t want to get the hiv virus the only option is to remove the foreskin revealing his awareness of this type of language and messaging within vmmc mobilization provider explained this is demeaning and they try to create some peer pressure like when you go to those mass cuts in high schools probably they registered like clients you would likely get another probably or so who because of the peer pressure just jump into it but if it was like walking from home to hospital and demanding for the service they are not likely to have gone but now that it is here and so and so has gone and is my friend i have to be in it unfortunately the quality of the provided surgery is lacking as well gt under pressure to meet targets some clinical officers and other vmmc medical staff find ways to speed up the clinical process for example as we were told during interviews and observed firsthand at multiple vmmc facilities providers may opt not to take patient medical histories or conduct preoperative examinations e g blood pressure weight preexisting conditions etc and or minute post operative check ins and yet fill in the requisite forms as if these activities had been completed other avenues for time saving include rushing circumcisions inadequate stitching splitting surgical utensil and bandage packs between patients not following recommended protocols or procedures e g the dorsal slit method for circumcision and stacking patients one after another with little pause in between which raises additional sanitary and privacy concerns according to an experienced vmmc surgeon we cut a lot of corners and i will give you an example so because of speed you find that while one client is dressing after circumcision the other one is already undressing ideally it is supposed to be that you finish with this client you give them instructions on how to take medication and all that but because of the high volume you find that some of us we are not the ones giving out the medication we assign somebody randomly you know who will be giving out the medication and the refreshment and so the information they provide to the client may not be correct sometimes even the vitals of post operation minutes after circumcision are not done it is skipped or somebody else does it probably a receptionist who is nonmedical just to fulfill the requirements of the form this is wrong because you are supposed to do the circumcision and the client rests for minutes in a bed or a couch then after that you do the vitals then you discharge oh even the wound care instructions that information may not sink in for the client because it is presented so fast and there may not be time for questions yeah there are so many corners we cut at a clinic last year i saw them hold that yellow form medical files and going through and just check check check adding blood pressure adding all these things just filling them in without actually measuring blood pressure etc provider one assistant surgeon a year old female nurse claimed her record time for completing a circumcision was six minutes she too associated vmmc targets with client overload and with rushing surgeries and an increase in adverse events she explained sometimes you compete cutting clients and the clients are too much the average time for a client s circumcision is between to minutes so when the clients are too much and you want to meet your targets you will perform the surgery a bit fast so upon that you will have an adverse event and maybe a child will come back with a bleeder an oozing artery or other blood vessel you did not close suture well provider and finally the guidelines to not accept boys under the age of are regularily ignored gt current vmmc for hiv prevention guidelines and national protocols approved for use in kenya require that adolescent clients must be at least ten years of age despite this directive interviews and observations confirmed that vmmc staff sometimes mobilize and circumcise boys who are under ten years of age in order to boost their numbers to meet targets when asked about potential links between targets mobilizer strategies and underage circumcision provider offered yes they bend the rules because you know sometimes our current age according to who is years and above but when they mobilizers go to the field and get a nine year old for example they coach this client and the parent because we insist on seeing the con sent we always insist they put the id and telephone number of the parent on the consent form when they come to the facility we call to confirm the age and whether the parent has consented for the child to be circumcised and you know they will tell you yes i am years old but when you look at the guy he is probably or we observed evidence for the mobilization of underage boys at ten of the vmmc facilities we visited for observation including boys and their mobilizers who readily admitted that they were underage these findings are in line with other research showing that consent is undervalued and that uncircumcised men report higher rates of depression and a lower quality of life which you are free to attribute to anything but the incitation of stigma if you like gt we identify gaps in the consent process and poor psychosocial outcomes among a key target group male adolescents we assessed compliance with consent and assent requirements for vmmc in western kenya among males aged n we also examined differences in quality of life depression and anticipated hiv stigma between uncircumcised and circumcised adolescents a substantial proportion reported receiving vmmc services as minors without parent guardian consent in addition uncircumcised males were significantly more likely than their circumcised peers to have poor quality of life and symptoms of depression others have questioned the way the figure is used as well as understood by patients by december about million boys and men had been victimized gt to date the u s president s emergency plan for aids relief pepfar has supported nearly million vmmcs to protect men and boys in east and southern africa with other sources claiming it to have been million in already guides have stressed the importance of encouraging peer to peer demand creation which is of course not bullying nor mobilizers hiring hitboys to bring them boys for cash as we know setting targets to boost performance well recruiting exclusively satisfied patients to dispell myths which unsatisfied patients can t apparently and to promote and integrate the program into highly misandristic traditions of mutilation as an initiation to becoming a man beliefs akin to those that have resulted in some of the most barbaric traditions around public displayals of forced sexual torture in the end it is undeniable that the voluntary in vmmc was a naive ideal at best and a lie at worst other ways to address the issue were present education on safer sex practices and rarely known devices that are accessible to couples in which the man has penile surgery scars lower erectile performance or other variations in shape and anatomy of their primary genitalia such as female condoms as well as the distribution of such devices are just one example after all if these misguided attempts wouldn t have changed societal norms and stigma to a state that makes it practically impossible to differentiate between choice and coercion nobody would stop anyone from providing accurate information on and a safe execution of voluntary circumcisions
13292,feminism seems more than anything as a sexual orientation february henry blair sexuality is not symmetrical human sexuality is constructed as a set of equivalences but very rarely as a symmetry in men and in women the very brain areas that are sensitive to sexual cues are sensitive to different things in men these brain circuits are sensitive to activated by women and in women the same areas are sensitive to activated by men this different attraction to different things in man to the feminine in women to the masculine is not cultural this difference is formed in the embryo in the sexuality brain circuit of structures called the deep brain nuclei see quote formatted comment below amp x b gt culture is created by the unique human cortex but sexuality lies elsewhere in our deep nuclei that we share with the animal kingdom just as cats or monkeys do not create a sexuality with a culture humans do not create their sexuality with culture either our human sexuality is imprinted in us just as it is imprinted in animals it is a simple and plain fact of nature that the deep nuclei where sexuality resides do not have the capacity to learn as the cortex has but only to express the drives encoded in them or suppress them suppress or express are the only options our human sexuality has rewriting is physically not possible in our sexuality regions which is why you will hear from every psychologist that the gay sexuality cannot be rewritten culture does not set sexuality alas some today might not comprehend that the same applies to every sexuality including the heterosexual one just as we have brain areas that are sensitive only to round shapes and brain areas sensitive only to moving lines and areas sensitive only to faces we have a sexual brain circuit that in men is sensitive only to females and in females only to males with the exception of gays and lesbians in whom this sensitivity is to their own sex while the two sexes of humanity are almost entirely the same they have the same human feelings emotions aspirations hopes and need for love they have the same mean iq and feel the same pain and suffering in one respect the two sexes do differ in all the things that directly result from their sex and from the sexuality that the sex determines innately see quote formatted comment below amp x b gt to realize that sex determines sexuality one must be aware that sexuality is wider than to whom one is attracted and includes the features that one s sexuality is focused on and in what style sexuality is expressed this difference is determined by the innate sex the brains of both straight and gay men respond to nudity of the sex they are attracted to times stronger than the response of same region in women s brains to nudity of the target of sexuality gay men are attracted to and focused on physical attractiveness just as straight men only to a male one gay culture is thus focused on external looks lesbians are attracted to status and success just as straight women only to a female one trans sexuality is typical to the sex at birth just as the brains of both straight and gay men respond to nudity of the sex of attraction times stronger than women s brains so do the brains of trans born male these are not random individual differences but differences between sexes created by innate sex and expressed in how the sexuality brain circuit functions differences that in most people form heterosexuality and without which there would be no reproductive sexuality in humans and humans would have never existed just like every other creature that reproduces sexually we too carry the same system that produces sexuality beneath our advanced cortex we have primitive deep brain nuclei that produce drives we share these brain areas with all mammals and even with reptiles hence they are dubbed the reptile brain and these ancient brain areas encode the fundamental impulses that create a two sexes sexuality an attraction in males to features that distinguish females from males and an attraction in females to features that distinguish males from females an attraction in each sex to different things an asymmetrical sexuality a sexuality which is established on innate asymmetry although sexuality can to some extent be influenced by culture the female and male asymmetrical attraction to sex distinguishing qualities is not cultural it is generated by drives imprinted in us see quote formatted comment below amp x b gt humans do have a sophisticated cortex enveloping their brains with which they have created civilizations and cultures and which generates self awareness that enables humans to shape themselves and humanity by choice or at least by no choice but our cortices are at the apex of a regular body that functions the same as the bodies of all living creatures humans are part of the living world as explained by the us national institute of health the genetic code of mice and humans is identical in those regions of the genome that encode proteins these are the genetic codes that create the living being with some of the genes being identical in fact of the approximately genes studied in mice and humans less than that s not a percent that s a number are found only in humans but not in mice or vice versa humans are living biological beings who were created by evolution and share with other biological beings most of their internal mechanisms and qualities including the mechanisms of sexuality thereby constituting part of nature generally speaking women have breasts vaginas and softness and men have wide shoulders penises and muscular physics and within heterosexuality men are attracted innately to the female sex distinguishing qualities and women are attracted innately to the male sex distinguishing qualities and the same goes for sex distinguishing qualities expressed as attitudes mental style and psychological differences we said nothing here about intelligence or mental abilities and capacities we are discussing the how and not the what here male style or female style yes some are attempting to convince themselves that every human how attributed to sex is a stereotype but it is not there are masculine and feminine innate hows which are part of the sex distinguishing qualities toward which the differing innate sexual attraction is set what is the nature of attraction men and women are usually not competing against each other in sexuality but are attracted to each other s qualities usually a man is not trying to be more beautiful than a woman he sees but instead he is attracted to her beauty and a woman in not trying to be stronger than a man she sees but instead she is attracted to his strength these are deep seated innate sexual drives that we all carry in our sexual brain areas when women see a sexy man who has qualities of male sexiness that they like they don t want to have the sexiness by being male sexy like him but to have the sexiness by having a relationship with the person carrying the qualities and when men see a sexy woman who has qualities of female sexiness that they like they likewise don t want to have the sexiness by being female sexy like her but to have the sexiness by having a relationship with the person who has those qualities both deeply want the sex distinguishing qualities that cause them to feel attraction but as a sexual and romantic love not as their own traits all humans within heterosexuality have an inclination and an inner drive to possess for themselves those qualities in the other sex that they are attracted to both men and women want to make it theirs but they want to posses it sexually through sexuality by attracting that person and engaging with the person sexually t his is the fundamental process of attraction it is an innate mechanism that creates life this has nothing to do with culture attraction to the sex distinguishing qualities through a drive to have the qualities by being sexual with that individual is what operates in all two sexes species who have no culture because it stems from innate hard wired drives and as noted the brain areas where these drives are imprinted are not learning areas as a side note if you are having trouble perceiving the notion that animals have drives to have and possess try to take a jar of honey out of the hands of a grizzly bear however although in most people the urge of having to myself the qualities of the member of the other sex to whom i am attracted is a drive to have as sexual fulfillment by engaging sexually and romantically with that person it seems that in a very small fraction of people the having is personal and is experienced as a drive to become the one with those qualities and attraction is inverted into jealousy humanism is the support of human equality as equal human rights equal human dignity equal cultivation and equal opportunity to all naturally including all women and this is the agenda with which this author and probably nearly all of the citizens of the democratic world adhere to while feminism is frequently presented as being simply part of such humanism there are extremely popular widely prevalent anti humanist sentiments in feminism expressed as slogans such as kill all men and the future is female a strong belief in female superiority and male inferiority and advocating for creating a difference in human rights and freedoms by sex that is that things that are defined as universally forbidden would be forbidden only for men while allowed for women all necessitating the examination of feminism separately from the universal framework of equality called humanism many women may call themselves feminists or express support for feminism while in fact there seems to be a very clear distinction between three types of such self identification women with a general humanist notion of equality who are not aware of the prevalent anti humanism of feminism and who would probably not agree with most of this preaching feminist women who are aware of the anti humanist sentiment and endorse it but are not the ones articulating the anti humanist preaching and finally the feminist core where anti humanism is articulated and preached this means that a distinction needs to be made between what might be defined as feminism sympathizers the two wider circles and feminists the core it is quite evident that the wider two circles feminism sympathizers are very different from feminists that is from this feminist core and were led into following this core without realizing this difference we are used to regarding this core according to how it presents itself as an ideological political theory oriented somewhat academic group however an accumulation of contradictions in anything that sprouts out of this core the harshest being a pretext of self affiliation with universal humanism along with an overt sentiment which is violently anti humanistic calls for concentration camps for men calls for extermination of of the male sex books titled i hate men becoming best sellers in addition to conflicts between declared decrees and expressed drives seem to point to a different nature origin and source of this core there is evidently a clear hostility in members of this core toward men and manhood which causes them to have difficulties in applying any universal perspective to men equally thereby creating their anti humanist position freud discussed what seems as expressions of a seemingly similiar conflict existing in a few women regarding manhood which he called penis envy i could never quite comprehend his concept are there really ordinary women who wish they had a penis why this concept of freud had always eluded me and i never quite believed that such a phenomenon really exists but recently and after observing the feminist core i started to suspect that he might have referred to a more specific concept which he attempted to describe with the terminology of penis envy figuratively not literally jealousy in the sex distinguishing qualities those qualities that create the sex and sexuality differences between men and women which normally generate within heterosexuality in each sex attraction to the other sex an extremely large assembly of yet unexplained phenomena seems to become trivially explained if we only consider that in a tiny minority of women there seems to be an inverted step in sexuality that causes a woman instead of being attracted to the male sex distinguishing qualities to become jealous of them and the more one looks into this possibility the more it seems that the origin of the feminist small core described above those who unlike humanism and its universal aspiration for equality are formulating feminism for at least years now as an anti humanist perspective might not be at all a political ideology but fundamentally one of the many inversions that human sexuality may undergo feminists present their aspirations as centered around equality but a closer look reveals that unlike humanism which has been advancing sexes equality since the mid th century feminism consistently had little to do with equality and if fact passionately generates wide spread discrimination and overtly advocates inequality in opportunity rights and liberties however this low interest in equality becomes less paradoxical if one only considers that in practice while it was humanism that was in the th and th centuries and is today the framework for every human including women for obtaining equality and was exerted by both sexes when enacting equality in law and culturally what motivated feminism was a drive to homogenize the two sexes this focus on homogenization is dramatically expressed in the fact that unlike humanists of both sexes feminists define equality as sameness when one tries to regard feminists from the feminist core as equality ideologists then this preoccupation with sameness becomes extremely baffling since sameness is not only not needed for equality and not possible physically between any two humans but is not any guarantee for equality making it completely irrelevant for equality and raising the question why then sameness of all things is the primary feminist aspiration this however becomes completely explained if we consider the possibility that feminists have articulated their perceptions through a wish to obtain the features that normally attract women for themselves thus arriving at their focus on sameness another phenomenon that stops seeming mysterious when one examines feminism as an emotional inversion from attraction to jealousy is how feminists rationalized that there are no two innate sexes only cultural molds that create an illusion of two sexes to the level of asserting that the different muscle mass and bone density is caused by stereotypes and deduced from this rationalization that the sex distinguishing qualities of men are also the qualities of women hence they could potentially posses them and have hope for gratification and that the envy would subside it is thus homogenization that concerns feminists to obtain sameness and not equality and so it seems not because of any moral considerations as found in humanism but out of a much simpler drive jealousy in women jealousy is almost synonymous with hatred toward the target of jealousy this might sound somewhat mysterious to men but for women and girls the immediate transformation of jealousy into hatred is so self evident that what they would find perplexing is only that i even bothered noting this while in men jealousy is generally associated internally and innately with competitiveness and motivates either effort or defeatism in women there is almost no emotional border between jealousy and hatred toward the person causing jealousy as the target of jealousy men would thus become in the emotional reversal of feminism the target of hatred thus a conundrum that literally no man truly understands today and neither many women what is the reason justification or source of the immense overt distilled hate of feminists toward men immediately becomes explained when regarding the feminist core as expressing an emotional inversion in sexuality yet many more seemingly paradoxical phenomena again become clear if feminism at its core is understood as an emotional inversion surprisingly for a group that claims to represent women women and girls are being forced by feminists to live under the de legitimization of their own sex distinguishing qualities through the shaming of other women for their femininity and in pressuring women to present male qualities to be better than men in manhood in statements that women are better fathers than fathers that women should be forced to be the initiator even against their drive to be the one approached to etc the overt hate speech against men also creates an intense feminist pressure on women to denounce the male sex distinguishing qualities in men qualities women are attracted to and love and with which within a female emotional inversion a competition would exist causing a drive to diminish male qualities in men for the gratification of being the one having them feminists attitude towards womanhood with shame and suppression their articulation of an aspiration for equality not as equal human rights but as physical equality sameness of two sexes their attitude toward manhood through jealousy that transforms into hate with yet the conflicting drive of showing that women are better than men in being men of having the male sex distinguishing qualities personally all become explained if one only regards feminism that is this core as opposed to feminism sympathizers as expressing an inversion within sexuality where the urge to possess the sex distinguishing qualities of the other sex by achieving a relationship with the subject of attraction to satisfy the innate quest for sexual and thus existential fulfillment an urge that underlies the process of sexual attraction and has created life itself as sexual species is experienced as a drive to have the sex distinguishing qualities personally as the qualities of oneself thereby inverting female attraction into female jealousy unlike the aspiration of both sexes as part of the the universal framework called humanism to provide human equality as equal human rights equal human dignity equal cultivation and equal opportunity for all feminism seems more than anything the politicization of what is essentially a psychological inversion in sexuality such inversions in sexual processing are commonly known as sexual orientations just as a small number of men and women present with an inversion of the sexual processing from attraction to the other sex to attraction to same sex women of the group commonly known as feminism seem to possess another type of inversion in sexual processing emotional reversal of attraction to jealousy which may be abbreviated eraj hence feminism in its essence simply and plainly can be regarded a sexual orientation like heterosexuality and homosexuality at some point in the mid th century some women have begun expressing and revealing a sentiment which may have existed in humanity throughout the ages as a rare variant of sexuality just like homosexuality instead of being attracted to the sex distinguishing qualities of men they expressed jealousy in those qualities in the s this took a political from now termed feminism when a small faction of women started to organize as a political movement allegedly to achieve equality in rights ignoring the action and results of over years of humanism but actually to steer society into their desired homogenization of sexes mostly forcefully out of a sexual drive which can be explained as generated strictly by a personal inverted sexuality since this is a minority orientation we can safely add it to the famous letters that become lgbtqf f for feminist should the sexual orientation called feminism be acknowledged and respected as any sexual orientation depends on the level to which their jealousy translates into hatred toward men as men do not have to be subjected to pan cultural hate and attempts to annihilate their maleness or themselves solely for the benefit of the sexual fulfillment of a sexual orientation generated by a reversal of female emotional response to men s sex distinguishing qualities from attraction to envy likewise women should not be put under shaming forced masculinization and pressure to denounce and alienate whom they love and are attracted to every sexual orientation should be celebrated so long as it is not harmful to others but it is very obvious that the feminist sexual orientation is currently extremely harmful to both men and women if the emotional reversal to jealousy reaches hate specifically any social expression of hate and certainly hateful acts including and primarily social incitement to hatred with hate speech meant to inflict pain it needs to be addressed with therapy this has no bearing on the vast majority of heterosexual femininity as this entire discussion applies to a tiny minority probably a fraction of a percent of womanhood included in that core described above nor on sexes equality which was and is the shared and collaborative aspiration of both sexes as part of the universal framework called humanism that protects all humans equally including both sexes permanent

13987,tired of seeing posts on here shitting all over tinder if you do it right there is no easier way to meet women in my opinion the ones shitting on it are the ones not having any success i ve been successful at tinder and bumble for the past couple of years and let me show you how i do it i know a lot of tinder guides have been posted here before but here is my take on how to have success step understand the ultimate maxim of tinder if you are not getting matches its because your pictures suck of the time this is the case it s not tinder screwing you its not tinder trying to get you to pay for its plus gold features its not shallow women its not women only on there for validation its not a glitch its not anything but the fact that your pictures are ass keep this in mind when you inevitably see someone shit on tinder in the comments of this post or elsewhere on trp step understand the tinder elo system and how it works basically tinder uses an elo rating system to rate each account to judge how attractive the account is based on their swiping and how they get swiped obviously if your profile gets swiped right a lot you ll have a higher rating and vice versa it s not just how people swipe you that determines your rating but also how picky you are if you are swiping right on everything your rating will go down because when you do that you are swiping right on low rated profiles if you are pickier and only swipe right on higher rated profiles you ll have a chance for a better score assuming you are getting swiped right a lot as well to learn more about how the elo rating system works mathematically check out tldr your tinder elo score is determined on the rating quality of profiles swiping right on you and the rating quality of profiles you are swiping right on step know your competition one thing i recommend doing if you have the time is creating a burner facebook account as a woman use it to make a tinder account and select that you are interested in men this way you can scroll through the profiles to see the men you will be competing with in your area a general theory of tinder is that for brand new accounts you get a noob boost which means they are going to show you the higher elo rated tinder accounts first and your profile will also be put toward the top of other user s stacks so they don t have to scroll through many profiles before seeing yours this doesn t mean every single tinder account in your stack that you scroll through will be high rated because remember there will also be new accounts in your initial stack who are also being boosted many of which will suck why am i mentioning this noob boost because you can use this to scout your competition the profiles you will be seeing when you do this are generally the profiles the attractive women will be seeing that way you know what you need to do to beat the competition for the sake of this post i went ahead and did this for my area medium sized city in the southern united states i scrolled through the first male profiles and gave each profile a rating on picture quality being shit being top tier and attractiveness being ugly being top tier and then i flagged an account if they were not lean settings age mile radius results of the profiles only of them had what i considered top tier pictures most were shitty selfies bad quality pictures that had grainy or fuzziness in them bad lighting or bad poses lots of crappy gym selfies and mirror selfies the average picture quality rating was out of that s bad and shows you don t really need to do much to have better pictures than the rest the average attractiveness rating was a not much higher than the picture quality number and this is supposedly contains the best profiles i think a lot of the profiles i saw were noob boost profiles no way they would be high rated either way i only handed out a to profiles that s and only handed out a to profiles that means out of only were what i considered attractive enough profiles a woman would swipe right on of the profiles were not lean were overweight and were obese once again shows how much impact being lean has average age was but the average age of the profiles i gave a or higher to was older guys seem to have a better grasp on this moral of this story you really don t have a high bar to clear when it comes to having a top tier tinder profile most guys tinder profiles suck ass all you need are good quality photos and to be lean to beat most tinder profiles out there unless tinder only shows the highest rated accounts to accounts who already have a proven high elo score and still hides them even from noob boost accounts step yes being attractive matters this is an app where people judge you on apperance you think looks don t matter they absolutely do i am not saying this app is worthless for you if you are below a in looks but you have to reel in your expectations women on these apps are pickier than they are in real life so if you are a don t go in expecting to match with s or higher before dismissing tinder and other apps all together try to max out your looks first lose weight get lean lift dress well wear the right accessories sport a good haircut hairstyle have a good facial care skin care routine and all of that doing all of this taking good pictures will go a long way and can add points to your attractiveness step pictures are of the battle i repeat the ultimate tinder maxim if you are not getting matches you have bad pictures period you are going to sink or swim by your pictures specifically the quality of your pictures period i consider myself an attractive man but i failed at tinder at first because my pictures sucked even if you are attractive if you have shitty pictures you are doomed when i finally put some good pictures on my profile it was night and day the number of matches and interest i was getting it became like shooting fish in a barrel i even got reported to tinder as a catfish because women thought i was ripping my pictures from models and wasn t who i was in the pictures now the term good pictures can mean so many different things from my experience here are the elements that make up good quality pictures picture quality there is a difference between a shitty cell phone front camera picture and a picture coming from a dslr or expensive camera this does matter front facing cell phone cameras generally have bad quality bad apertures bad lenses and distort your face the clearer and less grainy the picture the better lighting lighting matters pictures taken in the dark will suck because they will have high iso settings meaning more grainy pictures taken using indoor lighting often cast unnatural shadows with harsher lighting pictures taken with a camera flash add years to your face and create all kinds of bad shadows and unappealing flashback the best lighting is outdoors the problem with outdoor photos is that generally the sun will be too bright causing too many harsh shadows overexposure and your eyes to squint one solution is to take pictures when its cloudy or you can take pictures in the shade but beware of surrounding glare that causes you to squint the best time to take outdoor pictures is an hour after sunrise or before sunset known as the golden hour you can google golden hour calculator to determine what time exactly this is for your location during the golden hour you can take good pictures with soft golden lighting and yet its not bright enough to cast bad shadows or make you squint if you are wearing sunglasses it doesn t matter what time of day you take outdoor pics but generally you don t want to have more than or pics in your tinder picture album with sunglasses setting where you take your pictures matter a computer selfie at your desk in your room shit a picture of you outdoors somewhere interesting good the key here is variety when i was doing the burner account competition check earlier most guys are bad when it comes to variety of their settings find unique outdoor places to go to one of my favorite is the roof of a parking garage downtown on weekends there is no one up there i don t have to pay to get in and you get a badass view of the downtown skyline in the background parks hiking trails mountains lakes beaches rivers etc all work you can also be creative and get shots on the sidewalks streets etc pose and posture you want your poses to be natural based on the setting your picture is taken if you are taking a picture on a sidewalk you obviously don t want your pose to be as if you are posing for the camera you want your pose to be as if you were walking down the sidewalk go to youtube and look up modeling poses for inspiration and make sure to have good posture whatever pose you use facial expression the key here is variety you don t want all your photos to be of you smiling into the camera you don t want all of your photos to be of you looking away from the camera with your mouth closed and a serious expression i go with the rule of halves here you want half of your pictures to be smiling half not smiling then half of your pictures looking into the camera and half looking away composition where you are placed in the frame matters a lot you see a lot of guys fail at this when checking out the competition in my opinion there are only acceptable compositions half body shots and full body shots half body shots are generally shots from the waist or upper thigh up full body has your entire body in the frame but that is only half the battle you don t want much open space between the top and bottom of the frame use the entire frame this is a good example of what i mean in a full body shot the concept for a half body shot is the same notice how the whole frame is used not much gap above his head or below his shoes now here is an example of a bad full body shot notice how much empty space there is above his head and below his feet you want to avoid face only shots because they just aren t flattering and will hide your body which you want to show off if you are lean and also hides your fashion which leads me to fashion style your clothing choices matter and can greatly enhance your overall look if done right you want your pictures to show off a diverse variety of well fitting stylish clothes fit is the key more than style they both greatly matter but bad fit will ruin any style a good style can t overcome bad fit go shopping to stores like j crew and wear the smallest size you can that still fits in a slim style cut if you can find it some good ideas for clothes to wear dark wash slim jeans slim chino pants khaki is my favorite color flat front chino shorts at inch inseam or less slim fit casual button down shirts polos well fitting t shirts denim button downs denim jackets bomber jackets leather jackets slim dress shirts nice sweaters watches you need to wear one in every photo boots dress shoes loafers nice sneakers necklaces pendants and bracelets no cargo shorts cargo pants tennis shoes basketball shoes skater shoes flip flops sandals baggy clothes hats sweats hoodies logo or graphic shirts you need to be wearing a wristwatch in all your pictures hair make sure you put some effort into it whatever you do find a good haircut hairstyle for your face shape pets if you have a dog probably a good idea to have a dog pic motorcycle if you have one probably a good idea to have a pic of you on your bike step how to actually go about taking good pictures so i stated what makes a good picture but how do you actually do it there are ways i recommend all of which are viable and have their pros and cons the friend with a camera approach find a friend to go along with you with a camera and have him her take pictures of you in various places or settings ideally you ll want a friend with a good camera who knows a thing or two about how to take good pictures or you could go on craigslist or something and hire a professional photographer but that can be a bit pricey pros lots of possibilities someone else controlling the camera means you don t have to set and forget the photo settings or placement good for getting shots at busy places with lots of people without creating a distraction or scene think downtown locations cheapest approach cons less creative control over the pictures can only be done when friend is available and in that certain time frame not everyone has a friend who is available or willing to do this the tripod approach this is where you buy a tripod to go with whatever camera you are using set up the tripod and take pictures i do have a nice camera and a tripod and have used this approach but it can be difficult to get right even though i have a remote controller for it because with nicer cameras it s most ideal to have someone behind the camera to fine tune the controls for every shot pros don t need someone else can do everything on your own time allows for unique locations to be shot cons can be expensive not ideal for high traffic places tripod can be unstable and knocked over by things like wind some locations there isn t an ideal place to put the tripod even with a timer or remote controller it can be difficult to get the right photo settings in terms of shutter speed aperture and focus the drone approach this is personally the approach i have used over the past year to amazing results obviously drones aren t cheap but they are worth the investment not only can you get some good photos from some unique angles and take them anywhere but it also gives you a fun hobby as well on the side i ve used both the dji spark and dji mavic air drone for this both have good cameras and even better they have an interval setting meaning it will take a picture every seconds meaning pictures a minute dji spark battery lasts about minutes and dji mavic air lasts about minutes that means you can get pictures per battery tell me you can t find at least one good picture you can find a dji spark new for in stores or on ebay used for cheaper just make sure you get a quality drone dji is a good brand the cheap drones you can get at wal mart won t cut it pros don t need another person can get all kinds of unique angles settings locations you can t get with a tripod can be controlled remotely good picture quality once you get the settings right cons loud not ideal at all for use amongst places with a lot of traffic people so you have to find more isolated places some locations are restricted for drone use takes a while to learn how to dial in the photo settings like iso shutter speed and exposure value that flatter you the most expensive all of these approaches are viable but one of these approaches have to be used if you want to have top tier photos getting your cell phone camera leaning it up against something setting the timer and running into place isn t going to cut it outstretched arm selfies won t cut it cropped group pics won t cut it mirror pics won t cut it yes it takes time and effort and for some of the approaches investment but it pays off do you want to succeed or not step to shirtless ab pic or not to shirtless ab pic from my experience you can go either way if you have a shitty body are skinny or fat and have no defined abs and vascularity it won t work if you have a good body with defined muscles vein vascularity and a pack it won t hurt to have a shirtless picture in there it s not always ideal though there are girls who will swipe left when they see a shirtless picture no matter what i ve found that shirtless pics work better when you are looking for hookups not so much when you are looking for dating something longer term if you want to use a shirtless pic there is one rule it has to look candid shirtless mirror bathroom pic no shirtless gym selfie no if it looks like you are posing for the picture and therefore it was planned its not going to work it has to look like it was taken candidly unplanned as if you were doing something and someone happened to take a picture of you the shirtless picture i had the most success with was one of me at the park holding a football i made it look like i was playing football even though i was there by myself and used my drone to take the picture however i made it come across as extremely candid even though my pack and vein vascularity and muscles were showing off shirtless pics at the beach or pool also work step post processing editing you don t want to just use the pictures as they are you want to find your best ones and then edit them use editing software adobe lightroom is good the stock windows photo software is good i am sure iphoto is good to mess around with the pictures apply filters change the brightness contrast clarity saturation and all of that the key is to not go overboard with the filters and everything you still want it to look natural the editing will add to your photo not make your photo women will know if your picture is edited too much edit it in a way where it looks a lot better than the original but at the same time you can t tell it was actually edited step selecting which pictures to use the generally key as i have already stated is variety you want your pictures to give a well rounded perspective of who you are variety in terms of poses facial expressions outfits and locations obviously you want to pick your most flattering pictures the best approach to use is to pick locations and outfits and take a shit ton of pictures at all then pick the best from each group and there are your your lead picture needs to be your best one it needs to clearly show your face and your body uncovered eyes no sunglasses with clothes on no shirtless pics as your lead by yourself no group pics your last picture also needs to be a good one as if a girl is swiping through your pics will be her last impression before she decides to swipe right or left on you remember she will judge you by your worst pic i m not going to post my profile but here is a breakdown of my pictures of i am smiling of i am looking at the camera of i am wearing sunglasses of are full body shots head to toe all are taken outside no shirtless pics that i am currently using of i am wearing flat front chino shorts of i am wearing jeans of i am wearing khaki chinos of i am wearing dress pants of i am wearing a v neck t shirt of i am wearing a casual button down shirt with the sleeves rolled up of i am wearing a dress shirt with a tie of were taken in broad daylight both sunglasses pics of taken at sunset in the golden hour of taken in broad daylight but in the shade locations used beach sand downtown sidewalk work outside top level of downtown parking garage football field side of building poses used sitting on cooler leaning against pole leaning against wall walking with football in hand standing straight up smiling into the camera looking over shoulder no group pics or pics with others group pics are overrated yes it shows you having fun with friends but generally they are not flattering and the cropping you have to do ruins the quality i d rather have control over my pictures from start to finish if your pictures are good enough she won t give a shit if you are alone in all of them step your bio does it even matter in general your bio doesn t matter she really only looks at your pictures which are all that matter if your pictures are good enough then she might glance at your profile just to make sure you are a real person your bio will not help you at all it can only hurt you since you have all to lose and nothing to gain you need to keep your bio short and to the point if you are over feet tall list your height if you are say you are feet put where you are from what part of town you live in and about or things you like to do put the college you graduated from if you have graduated if you have a cool job put it in there otherwise be either really vague with it or don t put it in there at all example profile that works from new york living here in florida in west miami ohio state fishing traveling fitness and more there that s all you really need nothing in there that will scare anyone away or devalue you but makes you look like a real person don t try to put anything witty or funny or out there just keep it simple step deploying your profile and using tinder don t set up your profile until you are absolutely ready to start with your full profile because once you set up your profile you are put in others stacks if you already have an account delete it so you can start over upload your pictures write your bio and where you go from here is up to you swiping be picky only swipe right on girls that you are certain are who they are in their profile if she only has face shots chances are she is fat remember the rule if you got it flaunt it girls live by this if they have a good body they will show it off if they have good tits or ass it will be shown off if it looks like they are hiding something they are read her profile don t just look at her pics chances are you might like her pics but then you look at her profile and it will state she is a single mom generally if you have been swiping a while and have reached the point of the stack where all the girls are ugly and then you come across one that is hot chances are she is either a bot or single mom because legit hot girls who aren t single moms or don t have major red flags will never be that far down the stack being picky also helps your elo score which increases your chances of being shown at the top of the stacks of the more attractive women super likes there are two trains of thought on super likes one train is that its good it will make her think longer about you the other train is that its creepy and too much and shows her you are already too interested my take use them i ve had more good than bad from super likes not only that but using a super like automatically puts you at the top of her stack so you know you will be seen next time she logs on unless you have tinder gold you only get one per day so use wisely tinder gold i am a fan i only recommend however using this on a month by month basis i think its a good investment to use your first month the queue which shows who has liked you is helpful and will help you gauge how good your pictures are if its not filling up you have shitty pictures also the quality of girls liking you will also help you see what type of women is finding you attractive lastly it helps because it helps you ground yourself to reality a lot of girls don t log into tinder that much so by seeing who has already liked you you won t get your hopes up for girls in the stack who may or may not be active tinder hides profiles inactive more than weeks if you are successful at tinder i think its worth it to stay on gold after your first month i do the passport feature is useful for traveling as you can arrange meetups with girls before you even get there this is just my opinion though if you aren t successful paying for gold won t make you successful the best way i can describe tinder gold is that its a valet for an already successful tinder user it just makes it easier seeing who has already liked you might sound like something you don t really need or need to pay for and while i agree its actually been more beneficial than i realized boosts regardless of whether or not you subscribe to gold i think everyone needs to try a boost at least once a boost puts you at the top of the stack for everyone in your area for minutes this means you will be seen by everyone who logs on during that time i get matches regardless but each time i boost it seems like i get a lot more boosts help because after a while unless your elo score is good you fall farther and farther down the stacks of other girls tinder stacks and you won t be seen instead all she will see are high elo accounts and new accounts getting their noob boost women swipe a lot less profiles than men do since the attractive ones will match with almost everyone they swipe right on so its vital to make sure you are showing up at the top of stacks timing is important with boosts from my experience wednesday at pm is the best time to use it this is ideal because its before the weekend before plans are set if you use it on friday or saturday girls already have plans you get a free boost every month if you have gold otherwise its each bots obvious bot accounts are obvious their pictures are often cropped and low quality but of really attractive women in generic poses settings their bios are often empty or extremely generic and they often only have either or pictures exactly they are pretty easy to spot instagram snapchat follower farmers sugar daddy seekers and venmo scams you ll see girls on here who are clearly only doing it to rope in instagram snapchat followers or find a sugar daddy or get money sent to them via venmo here is my take on them yes that is what they are doing however for the right guy they will throw that away use the brad pitt test here if she saw brad pitt had matched with her on tinder you think she would just try to use him for venmo money or to get an instagram follow out of him no way if you think you are attractive enough go for it anyway generally these girls obviously fishing for instagram followers or venmo money should be massive red flags automatically disqualifying them from anything above plate material but its possible to bust through the massive shit test i ve done it multiple times step you ve matched now what so you have matched ideally with multiple women as successful as i am at this i would still say only about of women message me first and many women who message you first will be bots if you were unable to detect them prior to swiping you are going to have to do the initiation fuck that shit about message timing when to message her etc if i message her too soon after matching she will think i am desperate no just message her when you feel like it the key to an opener is to be different set the frame use her name and play on her emotions i ve watched girls use tinder before and pretty much every guy either opens them with a boring hey or hi or uses some really stupid cheesy pick up or sexual opener that is just awkward none of that is different none of it sets the frame in the guy s court and none of it plays on her emotions in a positive way it has to be organic review her profile and pictures and try to craft a message based on that don t compliment her physically i e you re hot or you re cute don t get sexual in the first message or use a dumb pick up line here is an example i used recently that worked it was a profile of a nurse who said she worked the overnight shift and lets say her name was anna gt anna are you a waffle house or ihop kind of girl since i am guessing those are the places i would have to choose from to take you with that schedule see what i did here i did a lot of things i set the frame as one that i will be taking her out not necessarily to waffle house or ihop i crafted the message organically based on her profile and i made her laugh with the waffle house ihop reference since those places are pretty sketchy in the am hours but people secretly love those places i also gave her a reason to respond here is another example of a girl who had a picture of her bowling lets say her name was tina gt tina if we go on a bowling date i am not letting you use the bumpers so you better learn how to bowl without them again i set the frame from the first message to one that i would be taking her out without asking her out i teased her about her bowling skills and gave her a reason to respond to defend her bowling skills we did go on a bowling date when all was said and done it s a numbers game you are going to have girls who don t respond you are going to have girls who unmatch you are going to have girls who take forever to respond you are going to have girls who are just not into it even if they respond it s really a numbers game the more girls you open the better chances you have at least one who goes through with it all don t get hung up on any one girl assume every girl you match with will ghost you assume every girl you talk to will eventually stop assume every girl who gives you her number and you set up a date meet with will flake don t get invested persistence is the key i think this is where most guys get discouraged and come here to write their omg tinder is shit posts they have shitty pics and only match with or girls have no abundance and when it doesn t work out with those or girls whether they don t respond stop responding flake etc they act like tinder is shit and all women on there are shit you have to remain persistent keep in mind the better you look the better your pics are the more attractive you are and better your text game is the less likely she will flake and the more likely she will respond and follow through i can attest to that remember that girls have dozens of matches and are only going to bother with their best ones step when to ask for her number ask her out so you have had a successful opener and started a conversation when do you escalate to get her number or arrange a date meet up every girl is different from what i have learned so there is no one size fits all plan some girls want more rapport and chit chat before they are comfortable giving you their number or setting up a date others require less regardless you need to at least try to get a number or set up a date in messages or less remember she has dozens of matches with guys who are farther along the process than you probably are so you have to shit or get off the pot eventually plus she will get bored if you don t go after what you want the best way to do it is to have the conversation naturally flow into you asking for her number or asking her out here is an example that i used of a girl who actually messaged me first gt her hey how was your weekend gt me pretty good you gt her nothing too exciting lol lots of work gt me well we need to fix the nothing too exciting part let s go get some drinks when are you free see how i took her response and turned it into escalation you already have the ioi otherwise you wouldn t have matched so why waste time i did it on message you need to look for the opening to make it flow naturally to asking for her number or asking her out sometimes that takes longer than messages but you get the idea you don t want to go too early though then you just come across as a player needy desperate the worst thing you can do is just make her your pen pal and ask dozens of interview style questions without escalating she is not an idiot she knows what you are there for if after messages or so you still haven t found the opening to ask for her number or ask her out just do it step so you ve got her number and set up a date now what try to set up a date within days of getting her number asking her out anything longer she will probably flake the only times i have successfully set up dates longer in advance is when she was out of town from there you need to shut the fuck up and not contact her until the day of the date where you confirm plans don t text her don t become her penpal all you can do at this point is hurt yourself if she initiates with you and texts you respond to be polite but space out your responses i m talking take hours to respond i had a girl who was all over me from the time we set up a date to the time we met up always texting me i didn t want to be rude so i would respond and i thought that since she was the one initiating i was fine wrong we go out and then after the date she says she wasn t feeling a connection you ll never live up to the standard you set by texting her you have nothing to gain and everything to lose resist the urge to text her until you meet up if she flakes she flakes it happens don t become invested if she is truly interested she will propose a counter time just because she cancels doesn t mean she isn t interested i had one cancel on me and i thought it was over and i needed to move on but she rescheduled with me does this approach also work with bumble yes the difference is that she will open you so you can take her opener and play with it that doesn t mean its any easier or harder my problem with bumble is that the userbase is smaller and there are so many inactive profiles on there unlike tinder bumble doesn t remove hide profiles that are inactive i was using bumble and saw the profile of a girl i work with who was married a year ago she said she hasn t logged on there since also you will match with girls on bumble and they still won t message you again girls get tons of matches so they will only message the cream of the crop become the cream the upside to bumble is that the quality of girls are higher conclusion and final thoughts tinder bumble online dating is pictures they have to be outstanding not good not great oustanding how much you want to invest in getting outstanding pictures is ultimately up to you because it takes effort and time and in some cases money just remember if you aren t getting matches its your pictures end of discussion it s not tinder screwing you over its not shallow women only looking for validation its not women having you outside of their tinder preference settings its not anything but your shitty ass pictures your approach if you are looking for hookups and your approach if you are looking for something more long term has to be different it really is a numbers game i know this sounds cliche but the more matches you get the more your odds are in favor of at least one working out you get more matches by having good pictures and utilizing features like boost tinder might seem like a lost cause if you only get matches and none of them work out but if you have or matches you re going to have matches that work out its the law of averages don t get your hopes up on any one individual girl until you actually meet up with her in person from there you apply trp to prevent the onset of oneitis don t match with a girl unless you are certain she is who she is in her pictures read her entire bio and look at all her pics before matching to find red flags tinder gold in my opinion is useful if you are already successful at tinder but it won t turn you from unsuccessful to successful i ve seen false advice given around trp that the opener doesn t matter if she is attracted to you she is attracted while attraction does matter the most you still have to give her a reason to engage with you invoke her emotions and set the frame shit or get off the pot she has dozens of matches and dozens of guys doing the same thing you are doing if you don t make a move another guy will build some short rapport and then find an opening to ask for her number ask her out there is inevitably going to be someone in the comment section saying you don t need tinder or dating apps all you need is day night game tinder is shit what if i told you you could do both mindblown gif
14071,i met this girl in the library english brunette small and very cute pretty face it s exam time and everyone s been pulling all nighters or staying up late we were in a computer room that was pretty empty and she kept glancing over i saw that we were studying the same thing we studied like that for a while but actually i was just on reddit and she was playing some kind of rpg on her mobile it was hot so i walked over because she was cute as hell and approach anxiety doesn t even register anymore and as soon as she saw me her eyes lit up and then she knocked her coffee over her computer keyboard lol we studied together for a while we had taken the same module answered some exam questions flirted quite heavily and then decided to head off because it was late she was very cute and smiley and seemed to be enjoying herself a lot it was like am or something she lived in the halls close by i lived far away i decided to walk her back to her halls because you know it was am she was happy about it we walk in the night and she brags to me about how her iq is and she s in mensa and i m like whowh this girl is into me huh i see her off at the front gates and then go to head home but not wanting to pass up a sure thing i say to her we should study together again that was fun she gives me her number eagerly skip to a few days later i wake around pm to a headache ass taste and a dry throat pulled an all nighter for an exam the day before and my recovery sleep seemed to have run over deep into the next day oops gotta make up for that sleep debt i guess the first thing i do is drink some water take a piss brush my damn teeth and then check my phone and see the message omw oh it s the girl she s on her way on her way where shit yeah we were hanging out today supposed to meet at i check the time shit i am not ready and i will be late how long can i make her wait well this is directly correlated to the attractiveness of the girl in this case not very long i get a move on the house is a tip and i anticipate maybe possibly potentially hopefully fucking this girl after so i can t bring her back to a shithole can i i begin cleaning the house airing out the smoke beer cans food wrappers trading cards soon i have a substantial rubbish bag and am not gonna let it stink up the flat i put on my trusty slippers put the door on latch and head downstairs i head out the main downstairs door and deposit the rubbish bag in the bin and attempt to re enter through the front door but i ve only gone and done it haven t i i ve locked myself out the first thing i did was buzz the neighbours no need to panic yet it s the downstairs front door that s locked the door to my flat is on latch they only need to buzz me in and i have access but no one was answering i only have neighbours the cute asian girl that lives across from me and a european couple above whenever i bring over screamers they try to match us it s pretty fun actually poor asian girl though anyway she wasn t answering and neither was the couple well fuck they were probably at work of course real adults have real jobs and don t sleep in until pm to study i weigh up my options and variables i should be at the library with this girl in mins i am quite literally in the clothes i slept in luckily for me that entails a thick hoodie and sweats because i save money on heating and pyjamas are for fags oh and my slippers of course however no phone no keys no wallet no current way to enter the house i consider scaling the building i m a climber but no parkour maniac and i don t think i was stupid enough to leave any windows open fuck i realise that this date isn t gonna happen i m stuck outside completely technologically naked with no way to contact anyone missing phone anxiety begins to creep in gonna have to flake on the girl cos i m a damn idiot and locked myself out of the flat a silent flake too harsh oh well she ll probably like me more after anyway so i decide the smartest thing to do is wait for my neighbours to get back which will probably be like or right that s when normal people finish their normal jobs right well until then i guess i just gotta kill time a few years ago i woulda stressed about a situation like this really just got stupidly anxious but i ve read solzhenitsyn this this is no big deal at all pretty funny actually lets make the most of it so i wonder down the high street in my slippers and get looks from the people on the street i probably look like a mess unshowered and unshaven and in my sweats but then i see my reflection in a shop window and i ve got that whole just woke up bed head grizzled college boy stoner look going on and i marvel for the th time at how attractive i am thank god for lifting the slippers flop on the pavement they probably will not last the day if i m gonna be walking around but oh well i remember buying these slippers only a few weeks ago i was in a store and i spotted them and immediately felt this ethereal feeling like they were important somehow and i needed them the slippers damn called to me so i bought em interesting now i know why morphic resonance after all or maybe just very good slipper marketing i sit on a bench by the river and watch the water it s a cold day i feel naked and unplugged and for the first time actually feel good about it i had no phone or money no internet connection no dopamine inducing distractions and i was alone with my thoughts and the cold air a sudden weight lifted from the top of my head it felt like i d just taken a small dose of something it was freeing i realised it was going to be one of those days i haven t had one of these in a while and i cherish them it now has to be past the time when i was supposed to meet the girl but i have no real way to tell i meditate for a while cos the air feels good on my face and then people watch in the park and pet a dog i begin listing off places to visit and planning out how i ll spend the next or so hours until my neighbours get back it s as i am walking up the highstreet that i find what i thought was an extinct species of store an internet cafe an oasis shit pass the tourniquet i have access again the pakistani guy at the desks sees me in my slippers i ve locked myself out i have no money can i use your computer please he looks at me ok number thanks bro i get on facebook and its and i notice she hasnt messaged me yet playing it cool nice i scroll reddit and memes for a while then i have an idea i google the number of my estate agent they should have a spare set of keys right paki bro let me use his phone to call them the lady on the other side didn t seem happy with my shit they couldn t help me plan foiled waiting for the neighbours it is then i scroll through trp for a while the old hambeast next to me is watching some african music video and breathing very loudly through her mouth and she s scrolling back and watching the same seconds over and over has been doing it the whole time i finally get a from the girl nice still playing it cool i make her wait for mins then hit her with the cant come sorry she says why i start to think about what i should do but i know immediately what i m going to do it s one of those days after all and i want her along for the ride you could come here though she waits a long time before saying where i message her the name of the nearest train station she says why though i tell her lol its a surprise this was obviously too much for her to bear and she texted ok lol coming wow that worked maybe i have her hooked already or maybe she s just an adventurous one both options are great i didn t really have a plan for what happens next though but who cares i ll make it up as i go along without my phone or my wallet i was entirely free to just drift with no responsibilities it felt amazing frankly it felt like i was a kid again playing outside during summer i was suddenly very excited to see her when she arrived at the station and saw me in my slippers she gave me the goofiest smile i could see in her eyes that she knew immediately that it will be one of those days i locked myself out i said how she s laughing so i tell her the story as we walk around town i m very self conscious that my breath might be bad due to the fact i actually haven t eaten anything yet but am also thankful i am ocd about brushing my teeth as soon as i wake up i didn t really think about gaming her at all i didn t analyse anything or hyperfocus on my actions i just kinda went with it it was fun i was completely in the moment and just ran around the town and played with her like a boy dog with a girl dog following him around it helps that she wasn t shit testing me or anything bitchy like that made it so easy and she happily bounced along like a lil sidekick well we try my flat again but my neighbours still aren t in obviously so we sit on the doorstep i ask her if she wants to study so we study on the doorstep for a while wait when do you have to be home i ask her uh anytime she smiles back cos i have no idea how long it will be till my neighbours get back you don t have to wait with me the whole time you know no i like it this is fun wow what a great feeling when a pretty girl genuinely wants your company we chat for a while and quiz each other on metabolic pathways and then decide to wander again i climb a tree and then we talk about our families i feel like a kid hanging out with his middle school girlfriend after school eventually we spot a mcdonalds so we go in i haven t had breakfast or eaten in hours fuck if i m losing gains so you know i don t have my wallet right so she gets us a chicken nugget sharebox and sprites and we blow the straw packets at each other then we have ice cream we wonder by the park for a bit and it s getting colder so we head to a sports department store and check out all the cool bikes and skiing and climbing gear and i tell her i ll take her bouldering some time and she s down we leave and i reveal i ve stolen a tennis ball and she gets mad at me becuase stealing is bad and scolds me so i keep bouncing the ball at her until she backs off and laughs and we play catch and she cant throw for shit and its cute the whole time everything felt right like we d been friends for ages and we were on an adventure together we hit up a supermarket because i m getting hungry again and we buy ham and dark chocolate and tangerines and a jar of pickles i wanted to get salted pistachios and mentioned it but the pistachios were very expensive and she was paying so this time though we had a security guard following us around for good reason too i was still traipsing around in my slippers which were muddy and beginning to fall apart probably looked like we were on drugs she pays again and i mentally add the tab up in my head with the nuggets as we leave the guard says to us scuse me did ya pay for those and i say why would we steal pickles mate and she waves the receipt at him and gives him that stacey disgust sneer that we ve all sadly been on the receiving end of it was astounding watching the pretty girl face morph into ultimate bitch putdown mode there are probably betas in her life who only ever know her as this but hey i get to experience the cute dorky side of her and i m loving it we leave the supermarket and she reveals that she actually stole the pistachios and hid them in her purse and i hug her cos i m proud and squeeze her ass and then we eat our meal in the park after the meal we lay together on the grass for a while and i give the tennis ball to a dog that tried to steal our food and then we attempt the neighbours again but still nothing and its like pm and i m starting to get a bit irked it s beginning to get cold now and i m afraid the girl is getting bored of me and also that my neighbours might just have gone away for ever and i don t wanna have to call a locksmith but soon it will be late i decide to take her to the one place in town i haven t taken her to yet paki bro is cool again with us using the computers and so we browse memes together for a while and the hambeast is still there literally doing the same thing as before she tells me about rick and morty but i don t really like rick and morty but i pretend its cool anyway cos why not and then i show her reddit and she doesn t really get it and then i tell her was an inside job and we spend then next hours arguing over conspiracy theories i make journeys to check on the neighbours in the meantime and my slippers are broken and flapping at this point and its fucking almost pm and no one is home yet i really don t want to have to do the lame and expensive option of getting a locksmith but its getting increasingly likely what if my neighbours were just away i hadn t heard them banging in a while tbh everytime i get back to the cafe she is slouched there scrolling instagram and she hasn t left yet and its dark now and the cafe has got that dingy yellow light grimeyness to it and with the pretty bored girl sitting there and the ambience it looked like a damn hopper painting and that snapshot remains imprinted in my mind really nice i tell her no one is stopping her from going home as it s getting late she says she feels bad for me and wants to see me get tucked in bed nice and warm sweet at pm i break and realise my neighbours probably aren t coming back tonight and it was just my luck or providence that i got locked out today i decide to go for the last resort and call up a locksmith using the girls phone i m bit grumpy about it but also got shit to do tomorrow gt i only have door i m locked out of how much and how long the lady on the other side said reasonable mins sure but first i have to run it by the girl gt you re not broke are you gt why gt i need for the locksmith gt sure she says gt okay please come immediately i tell the lady we leave and i attempt to give the internet cafe guy of her money as a gesture of thanks but he s not having it and seems more invested in the asian tv show he s watching anyway so we go to the atm so she can withdraw the cash and then return to the doorstep to wait for the locksmith it seems locksmiths and drug dealers have a lot in common they always seem to be more minutes after mins the girl starts yawning and i begin to shiver cos it s cold and she cuddles up to me i call again and basically shout at the lady on the phone to hurry up and also to give me a discount she says i say that s not enough and i wanted she said ok ok i can feel myself getting hot angry at the whole situation now but i catch myself cos i know its stupid and i don t wanna break frame in front of the girl so finally after mins the guy arrives and i think its gonna be a simple affair but nope life ain t that easy final boss so this guy shows up and he s eyeing me up oddly and eyefucking the pretty girl he asks what needs opening i show him the front door and the top latch lock that just needs to be picked or whatever i actually have no idea how locksmiths operate but i m sure he s had this a million times before gt he gives me a hmmm and a haaa and says well it looks like i m gonna have to drill it gt that sounds expensive gt drill it is there nothing else you can do gt gt no i m gonna have to remove the lock and install a new one gt gt does that mean new keys and shit gt gt yeah i m afraid so gt gt hey man i don t wanna bother my neighbours just cos i m an idiot you sure there s no other way you can try gt gt no this happens all the time only way is to drill it out he seems pretty sure of himself gt gt nah dude i m not gonna pay for that it s got a bit tense because we both realise neither of us is willing to back down yet the girl can feel the animosity between us but she seems to know her place and doesn t say anything the frame battle continues i weigh up my options i need to get in this guy wants to rob me i could get a new locksmith that means another mins probably and maybe another scumbag fuck that i want to get inside now then i think back to one of the first lessons i learned when i stumbled across this subreddit your greatest power as a man is your ability to walk away i smile gt okay dude cool i m not gonna inconvenience my neighbours will figure out how to get in tomorrow gt i ask the girl hey can we go back to your place tonight gt she s surprised but says sure of course gt cool that s sorted then sorry dude i m just a broke student you know haha i see the panic of a lost sale in his eyes he realises that i m not bluffing but i give him an opening in truth i actually want this damn door open you must always give them an opening to backtrack it helps them save face gt gt could you just give it one last look though just to make sure gt gt you know what mate let me try something he says as he rummages in his van of fucking course you go for it mate you try something mate bastard so he grabs this long hook claw thingy and feeds it through the letter box and opens the door in seconds flat and i wanna bash his fucking head in but mostly i m just glad that we re finally inside and it s warm and also victory tastes sweet cos absolutely fuck this guy don t blame him that much tbh most people are weak and agreeable and probably fall for this one all the fucking time but that s still such an asshole way to do business so she hands me the cash but i give her back and she has a note and so i give him the for mins worth of work not bad bro and he says gt its mate i get a hot flash of anger wow round it is gt your boss gave me off for being late gt i wasn t told anything about that he says gt well she did he pauses for a moment still holding the money i can feel the girl get more anxious we re inside now and the silence makes the tension worse gt i m pissed whether she told you or not you still owe me a discount you were very late he smiles it s a good shit eating smirk ladies must like it gt okay but its thus guy must be joking the hot anger cools into a shrewd sharp chill as i realise fuck this guy i know exactly what he s doing if he s not gonna get his cash he ll at least try and make me sperg out and break frame in front of the girl petty but effective cant allow me to win too hard can he i give them both a smile do you have a pound babe i ask her she doesn t so i go upstairs and grab a pound from my loose change it feels great to be back in my home again i also clean up a bit more and fabreeze lol probably should not have left her downstairs alone with the asshole but i get back down and he hasn t cucked me so i put the coin straight into his palm okay we re done you can go now he seems pleased with himself and leaves we get upstairs and i put the radiators on down a glass of water and stare at myself in the bathroom mirror for a while to try to dissipate the anger such a great day and one guy s gotta be an asshole and ruin it then i realise that i don t have to think about it that way and actually i just smashed through a significant confrontation that i would have failed miserably years ago this is the kind of shit dads train you for and i never had a dad but shit i managed to do it they say trp is just for picking up women but honestly it s so much more this place taught me how to hold frame and power talk and navigate confrontations like this beforehand i would have been an agreeable pussy and bent over for the guy and the day had been fucking great too a day disconnected from responsibilities and exams and social media a day free of anxiety where i could just flow in the moment and mess around with a cute girl like i did when i was a kid and had i never even spoke to the girl had i pussied out in that one pivotal moment in the library this day would never have happened always approach guys you never know where the story with that girl will go and pussying out kills the story before it even gets to start regret is always worse than rejection as i think about this i give myself shivers and am proud and then smile in the mirror like a fucking psycho and scare myself but then realise its not that bad and i can smile when i m proud if i want it s no big deal i enter the living room and she s taken off her coat and shoes and looks at me warmly and says you have a nice place and i say thanks and then she immediately and very eagerly begins removing my clothes epilogue the next morning we cook breakfast and i m head chef and she s like my nurse handing me scalpels and shit and its fun to boss her around and she follows my instructions afterwards i walk her to the high street to see her off at the atm i withdraw all the money from the tab i racked up yesterday and pay it all back immediately then i kiss her off at the station i feel pretty darn great about myself and basically skip home and jump into bed and just take some time to process things now that i m finally alone the whole of yesterday was amazing and i learnt so much about myself all it took was some damn disconnection from life for a while i consider trashing my phone and getting a brick could i make the leap probably a good fucking idea we know now that zuck is listening to everything we say and i m trying to avoid getting on more lists than the many i m already on then i think about the girl and just how lovely and sweet she was to be around it was like she energised and supported me gave me the life and exuberance i was missing i suddenly really wanted to see her again and felt the first few hints of one itis settle in she was so nice and feminine and smart and loyal and had the whole girl next door would never cheat on u vibe going hey if we were a couple this would be a great origin story to tell people i wonder what our kids would look like i settle for going on facebook to look at her pictures and miss how pretty she is i click on her profile pic which is very demure and innocent and makes her look smart and then i see it instantly gt in a relationship with lol why did i get my hopes up what was i expecting awalt after all
14401,smc s window the constrained arousal hypothesis challenging dr jordan peterson himself as a way for the readership to understand he is wrong on his views of the sexual marketplace despite his desire for his belief system which can be most accurately understood as operating as a traditional conservative with knowledge of a woman s short term mate preferences masquerading as a short term mate and or compromise within a long term relationship to be the optimal relationship structure for a man that wants a family it is fundamentally misinformed the hypothesis is framed agnostically to him yet as if it where to land on his desk so for readers who haven t digested the content here properly where it has distilled itself into some illformed approximation of what you should actually

happiness paradox where as women approach their stated ideals for happiness they lag men the female arousal paradox where as women approach their stated ideals for relationships they are sub optimally aroused this is self evident within the results of the dual mating hypothesis the egalitarian family paradox where as the more egalitarian a relationship is the more likely it is to fail causing less children to grow up in the household of their biological father this is self evident in higher divorce rates of highly egalitarian nations men who believe they can use knowledge of a woman s sexual preferences for a ltr attempt to masquerade as str mates this is not a solution to the problem and can not be for fundamental reasons the solution to this systemic problem is found within the female happiness paradox and requires a shift in male conceptualizations of women along with institutional recognition of this paradox the entire sexual marketplace is constrained on the basis that the female sexual arousal window is much smaller than the male s and most if not all of the conflicts in long term relationships family and marriage arise out of this issue one that we could state is simply that arousal can t be negotiated more or less that the failure point of a relationship is female arousal in the company of the male this is not finger pointing as this is a gendered issue some time is spent explaining that if men shared the same biological constraints they d likely act in similar ways pleas to male virtue are likely without basis the outcome of this knowledge greatly conflicts with dr jordan b peterson s posits to young men everywhere on how they should orient themselves within the sexual marketplace which can be summarized as to be a civilized monster while still adopting the traits of a real man namely responsibility and family cognitive biases that distort the ability to be able to see the sexual marketplace from the top down superordinate cognitive bias framing effect first we should understand that we re all seeing the same information and interpreting it in our own way so while we re looking at the same world we must control for our biases to see the truth that sits in front of us without this we are constrained to an argument that is only addressing our willingness to accept or reject another s view of the same truth this is the reason this hypothesis is constructed in the way it is it must accept that every reader will have a different view of every single facet to it and attempt to control for the biases implicit to each portion of the illusory truth that has been debated since we ve debated the idea of love and romance and whether or not we are monogamous creatures the bias that houses the rest of the issues availability heuristic potential partners are either good or bad and we are either monogamous or polygamous these are the first available possibilities availability cascade love is the world s largest mutually shared illusion this is simply the widespread reinforcement of the availability heuristic we then extend this notion to finding good or bad partners and believing in or rejecting monogamy confirmation bias which we reinforce by assuring ourselves that we are able to obtain the positive outcomes we see occurring naturally these couples act as promotion mechanisms even though they are very rare most people will see their positive qualities in themselves declinism men view traditional conservative relationships and institutions as being the best when instead it is best understood that these times simply represented the best tradeoffs in equity not equality and that it was the least suboptimal solution mechanisms of action promotion mechanisms we can understand this as the grease for the wheels natural declines in love chemicals to near depletion typically around years year itch this is part of the evolutionary framework which seeks to increase genetic quality and diversity innate competition for female resources sex from men which exacerbate this issue narrow lens of female perception of male attractiveness starting at top of male attractiveness does not follow a normal distribution which blinds her to less attractive mates making competition a certainty even when women outnumber men greatly this is also part of the evolutionary framework which seeks to increase genetic quality and diversity widespread belief in the ability to negotiate attraction and that we will hold reason over their animal self lack of widespread belief in the strength of post hoc rationalization and lower than perceived degrees of control over free will female long term strategies gamy description masquerades as actual relationship orientation strategy failure typical failure

between the first gambit in the table above is she s choosing a man that would trend more towards abusive and rather than seeking to control volatility she s looking for signs he ascribes to traditional male value systems so despite his proclivity to be a warrior rather than a diplomat would you expect him to be in the delivery room would he still want to see his child graduate high school and that outcome would be greatly influenced by her ability to reject her desire to control out the very things that keep her invested in the relationship these are the paradoxical issues hundreds of thousands of men deal with every year that are counseled by men across the world naive men ponder idealistic concepts like whether or not he s spending enough time taking her out on dates while experienced men are literally tearing their wives clothes off if the situation demands it the catch here being that a woman who is certain she needs the control and hands it over to her rational side is being sexually assaulted the woman that s able to separate out how it should be and how it is goes along for the ride and thanks him for it the disney fantasy in which a woman dates and appreciates a prince charming is constrained to women with zero or close to zero partners in which the man she s dating matches her ideal composite male that gives him plenty of room for error and allows him to operate in a way suboptimal for attraction that woman can both believe in the idea of love for loves sake and have it but few women get this and the ones that do can jeopardize that in one night away from home a thousand mornings with flowers will be boiled down to that was cute the ones that don t get that don t get it because they can t reconcile prince charming with their arousal floor this can be understood as the likely reason behind the inverse correlation between partner count and stable marital outcome this form of lifestyle inflation is a linear ratcheting mechanism to

sub optimal solution which is essentially a mirror to briffault s law gt the female not the male determines all the conditions of the animal family where the female can derive no benefit from association with the male no such association takes place robert briffault the mothers vol i p in this case the male determines his willingness to provision under the animal family that is a shared duty of performance men and women believe or at least choose to believe there is a solution denoting a way to change the world or balance the scales so everyone wins yet the best we can do is select a system with the least number of negative effects which maximizes outcomes for men women amp children while benefiting society at large by promoting values that can coexist within the socioeconomic system to the extent we can there is no way we can t not hurt each other boiling this down entirely i believe only one true conflict divides men and women women have a narrow view of arousing males something around of men and really the top ultimately and their attraction is fickle if men were subject to the same then only testosterone estrogen would likely separate us this i believe is the actual programming of evolution itself that very mechanism is the way in which genes are improved by always seeing the best and being literally blinded to inferior mates where evolution seeks to increase genetic quality and diversity if men were subject to this same constraint all the claimed loyalty and male values would fly out the window as they saw the women in their lives the way that women see men who they no longer find arousing understand i ve taken great effort to extend as much understanding to women as possible forming this hypothesis and in doing so been able to reconcile good girls and bad girls and dispute the idea that men are more loyal this entire argument that we frame as men vs women instead can be understood as those who are easily aroused against those who are not this is exacerbated by the fact that women settle for men by design since they select against features of arousal for a ltr she trades to volatility of a more viscerally arousing mate for an easily controlled man whom has nurturing characteristics and so what so do most men but again men are not constrained in the same way regardless to agree with peterson here means a different thing it means to be a great physical specimen who is narcissistic and arrogant who walks the walk and talks the talk who is either unapologetically polygamous or at the very least has ultra high standards for his monogamous relationship but is capable of it but likely this serves as a cope because the most viscerally arousing men simply have no interest in monogamy there are viscerally attractive men top men with no interest but now you re at a fraction of of men to which many would argue that no family could survive such volatility yet women turn a blind eye or give a hall pass to these men all the time this just isn t something that most men are willing to understand or digest much in the same way dr jordan b peterson is willing to send a million men into the grinder rather than accept the message that men have learned in these forums through blood sweat and toil few men in these forums started from a position of amorality few of them believed what it would take to save their marriages how brutal courts would treat them or how duplicitous their wives would turn when their bedrooms turned cold these true monsters balance the deal gt the deal gt men sacrifice polygamy male value and embrace monogamy female value women sacrifice hypergamy female value for loyalty male value gt men take ownership of women male value women take ownership of their children female value and under one household they share resources the nuclear family male value since women are biologically unable to promise monogamy the male rejects this part of the deal and trades her fidelity to him with provisioning this creates a dual duty of performance and only a civilized monster can pull this off this is the gritty stuff that men always let their ego convince them is unnecessary and the source for the masquerade the short term mate schema ends when the effort to retain a mate becomes more important than changing them out from this point on no attempt of the male to masquerade as a short term mate can ultimately be congruent absent his actual willingness to leave and to upend the lives of everyone in his family strictly on his terms with an unlimited willingness to enforce them whether or not this is interpreted as emotional abuse or boundaries is up to the viewer put another way a man s willingness to provide outside of the nuclear family while sexually active with his wife will negatively influence the game and its outcome dramatically this is where a man is put into a situation where a woman wouldn t tolerate it where being a real man expects that he accept the deal that would otherwise be seen as abuse this is a manifestation of our innate understanding of sexual competition and selection itself a subconscious recognition of a woman s superior position as selector put even another way we could say that to extend this provisioning either overtly or through implication by accepting the legal framework after a relationship dissolution the man acts as a mechanism to help transition a woman to the second evolutionary stage as a stepping stool all with the encouragement that he s being a real man men and women within a short term relationship operate under the prisoner s dilemma each relationship is a game unto itself the game is post hoc rationalized as casual but its purpose is to promote high quality genetic transfer women who only engage in casual sex with men that would be good fathers are the loudest but are practicing atypical selection as per the dualistic studies when raw arousal and excitement ends the game ends and players move on if they reconnect it s an entirely new game but the women here more or less understand these men aren t the father type men and women within a long term relationship operate under the iterated prisoner s dilemma the game is post hoc rationalized as romantic love but its purpose is to find a male willing to invest in his offspring at the expense of raw arousal settling is stereotypically female by design as she is the one selecting and that she selects against features of raw arousal such as ill defined jawlines or features like nurturing which are negatively correlated to arousal history is factored into the next round of play so from the very moment a woman pushes back to the man in the relationship which is already sub optimally aroused for arousal and figuratively says what are you going to do about it the relationship is in peril at this very moment essentially anything a man does from this point on will be wrong or abusive this is why from a game level perspective being a good man is impossible the minute she questions your willingness to pull the pin the gambit is up either you commit to being the one that cares the least or you demonstrate it by negotiating with her on her terms this is a manifestation of comfort breads contempt the studies show a clear picture short term mates in their very being are uncontrollable hyper masculine men arrogant narcissistic with low features of nurturing little future income potential etc and these things are correlated to arousal the very opposite of this is to negotiate a mutual domestication with agreeable men men accept and promote this because in their minds it relieves them of the duty of performance within this context i m strictly defining this as a man s competition against other men they then shift their duty of performance to their mate and family although she does not recognize this sacrifice because she is not aroused by it this is an on paper transaction that ever penny the male sinks into he will lose if the duty of performance is jeopardized this is the exact point where men are locked into a double bind want to wake up know that traits associated with good fathers are negatively correlated to arousal stick that in your s dad pipe and smoke it literally turned off by your good nature even if you think you re a silverback patriarch which you re still going to cupcake day at the zoo buddy these paragraphs summarize the reason why dualistic strategy exists for a woman since these two types of men can not be assimilated into the same man unless she is wildly tolerant to risk and is willing to risk being left with children from a wild man who has no interest in sticking around that is a tough gamble and only the lowest status women typically make this gamble though women should be leaning more towards this it is again paradoxical the willingness of a man to enter an honest above the table monogamous long term relationship de facto excludes him as a short term mate in practice and definition as comfort and high levels of arousal are often at odds for women though the reverse is true for a ltr which is why again men in ltrs often function as useful idiots which is another failure point for long term relationships when amorally female if the male discovers she isn t faithful again for the women making these choices they make sense to her at the time they re reasonable rational choices and they only have to finally confront themselves when they re in a marriage with children and they ve lost attraction then the spark is gone then all the good boy points a man has accumulated instantly self immolate and the true value of being a good man becomes crystal clear then it becomes real then the button up woman with a degree who works hours a week and is a mom too suddenly finds herself having moral conflicts she d never had to confront before then she becomes the woman she never imagined herself to be with a husband struggling to understand how his wife could be just like all those women he thought she could never be while everyone else either says he wasn t man enough or that he picked wrong never accepting the possibility that they each played out their evolutionary script perfectly and that it hadn t failed but was just moving on to the second evolutionary stage so to any man that wants to be a family man he must accept this first and foremost before he starts lying to himself that he s just responsibility and hard work away truly successful relationships are exceedingly rare where both husband and wife are sexually satisfied through their years and the marriage functions as a useful mechanism for raising children though i would say men functioning as useful idiots oblivious to their wives are common place and for the success cases it probably would not be surprising that they trend more towards what is outlined in this hypothesis positive outcomes correlated to female arousal negative outcomes correlated to female need for control over their mate again agreeing with peterson here men should be monsters who chose to stick around for their children not whom agree to be civil or domesticated the actual incongruence with dr jordan b peterson amp men who identify with him this can require some unpacking i am on the one hand agreeing with dr jordan b peterson here that women want a civilized monster or some variation of a monster that cares about her while fundamentally disagreeing with his overall message that men adopt traditional conservative viewpoints the very man he understands and posits a woman would want fundamentally conflicts with how he wants men to orient themselves in the world these very men are not generally going to trend on the side of family man types however unless she has without restraint let the dial move all the way over to unrestrained psychopath type more often than not if she s fulfilling a feminine roll he ll adopt a masculine roll and invest in his children i understand in detail where he s at through his journey in understanding this and i do not expect dr jordan b peterson to be able to reconcile how he wants things to be with his own knowledge base either a change of his message will be necessary or a refute of this hypothesis which so far he softens with some degree of work hard be a civilized monster and if she destroys it all you probably missed some red flags or should have been a better man and the reason why this message resonates with men so widely is because that is the fundamental place that men start from in one degree or another it s just a rebranding of the existing illusory truth it sits as a nice piece of confirmation to the bias you hold in the same way young men and women accept the idea that we are polygamous amorality is fundamental and necessary to this arrangement or else it is subject to the same failure point if you came to him because you felt lost in the world and want a family this isn t the solution to your problem it s just a rebranding that will land you back in the same spot if the reason why you came to peterson is to reclaim your masculinity then you should look elsewhere if you ve come to him because you re just a message and need to start getting back on your feet then proceed with caution if you re using him to mine some facts of the human condition i believe there is no greater man on earth spitting this knowledge right now he is without a doubt the world leader in understanding what makes us tick as people and understands the individual better than anyone but he suffers from the same belief system issue that nearly every guy had before his unicorn showed him she was just like those other girls the collective knowledge of hundreds of thousands of men dictates that we do not know another way that men reach the next stage and so my concerns are that dr jordan b peterson is unable to be moved from his position unless his family were to be put through peril and even if he d likely externalize it on his work schedule failing as a father or a lover if the issue was instead arousal in say the introduction of a competing male while he was away gt loss of female arousal to the male after retention costs exceed trading costs again the male must be willing to enforce his provisioning within the nuclear family while sexually active with his wife at all costs whether or not this man is moral or amoral in his choice of monogamy extramarital partners etc actually has a paradoxical outcome on marriage outcome anecdotally within these communities put frankly a civilized monster would cheat on his wife almost without pause and yet the men you d orient to the sexual marketplace certainly would be draped in morality almost certainly instead what dr jordan b peterson would advocate for would be to masquerade as a short term mate to ultimately still be a real man this is not markedly different than the very same men he rightfully bemoans this well reasoned seemingly articulate argument fails at a basic level which is dr peterson we all tried that replacing a low t agreeable man who is within an egalitarian relationship with a man with a pair who sets boundaries will not change the fact that failure is a feature not a flaw of evolution we will never return to enforced monogamy and so only thing men can reply with is to enforce provisioning monogamy wasn t legally enforced it was just enforced de facto in a world where women offer freely what was once coveted this is a fair trade and that is the birth of the real monster that realization that women do not accept this compromise because they can t is the birth of amorality ultimately men aren t entitled to a woman s love arousal and men need to be willing to defend themselves against provisioning once the gig is up at any and all costs i have given you every bit of understanding you need in this post do not ever promise to provision outside of the nuclear family while she is sexually active with you you have your word and your balls don t break them for anyone if she doesn t understand you if you don t believe this deep within yourself if this is not congruent to you then you are not oriented to deal with the world if you are not capable of enforcing this work on yourself until you understand this it is the only thing you need to understand not the myriad of legal frameworks pua gimmicks tpr theory etc just learn what separates you from the guy you wouldn t talk shit to in the bar what separates you as men defines the requisite capability of a man who wants to start a family to protect himself against female nature to reject de facto provisioning after the end of a relationship creates her own duty of performance stop ascribing to ideas of women worshipping good men when they just tolerate them women who are not fighting the battle with themselves will never leave a man who is satisfying her in bed and helping to raise children even if he does monstrous things again i agree with peterson but only in the way he s not willing to understand accept the very thing he s selling us we can t in any way claim he discovered this by accident or he s right but for the wrong reason given his level of involvement at a clinical level he knows this he just chooses to believe what he wants to be true what he chooses to see as the solution he wants to believe like nearly every man here that women will respond to the compromise and accept the good man with an edge and they will until evolution steps in then all the good boy points are invalidated and guys land here look for answers and they like peterson will push back that we aren t real men but instead little boys who are exploiting women almost none of us started from the position of amorality dr jordan b peterson i politely ask that you refrain from pushing the very narrative that has destroyed a generation of men already there are distinct male orientations and institutional changes that do not involve forced monogamy that can change that but right now you are hurting not helping men in this domain while helping them still find purpose and meaning in their increasingly meaningless lives please refrain from pushing this narrative until you are willing to have someone challenge you on it you are equipped to understand this and change the world if you choose but you are having an existential conflict where your very morality is up against the truths you ve grappled with for years you want the men you re talking to most of whom are in the th percentile to perform to the percentile and if they fail at that lay blame at their feet which isn t wrong in a literal sense but doesn t make sense from a pragmatic perspective making men own their lives is important marching them into the grinder is irresponsible
14538,tl dr men aren t reared correctly as a consequence of this most men are simply boys that are extending their adolescence for as long as possible this means that women are surrounded by low value unattractive men this is driving up their urge to regulate the sexual behaviour of men through society wide compliance tests all men are failing these tests even men in the anti feminist camp the specifics of this are not talked about or understood correctly at all and it s important that men understand this i implore you to read this full piece so that we all understand what s really happening women are the gatekeepers of sex men are the gatekeepers of commitment men want sex women want commitment if a women gives you sex immediately she gets labelled a slut if a man gives commitment away too easily he gets friend zoned keep these general rules in mind whilst reading this piece male attractiveness men offer two things to women value and comfort value is how attractive you are it is your number out of it can be summarised as the traits you have that indicate that you have the potential to move up a dominance hierarchy the dominance hierarchy is the social structure that men formed in hunter gatherer societies and it was roughly based off of who could add the most value to the tribe men formed this hierarchy and women mated with the men who were at the top this ensured that only the right men would propagate their genes only some men all throughout human history were allowed to pass on their genes which makes perfect evolutionary sense if there are men and women in a tribe why would you have each individual man mate with each individual women why not just get the man who has the highest value ie can add the most value to the tribe to mate with all the women that makes the most sense from a purely evolutionary perspective men of high value are men that can move up dominance hierarchies the traits that these men have are usually centred around risk taking behaviours and an ability to maintain your composure under these high risk situations if i balance on a tightrope that s one foot above the ground that s quite impressive if i do it between two buildings that s x more impressive if the wire is the same width then that means the level of balance i m displaying is the same so the reason for why it s immeasurably more impressive when performed at a greater height is that the risk is greater people who can partake in risk taking behaviours and maintain their composure whilst doing so inspire awe and admiration in people the men who were willing to venture into the unknown and conquer it were greatly admired we formed hero myths centred around such behaviours how men test each other let s say you re an alpha male in high school and you see a dweeb walking down the corridor you get a sudden urge to shoulder check the dweeb and shove him into the locker why do you get this urge and why do you laugh with your friends whilst doing it why do adolescent boys enjoy such behaviours well it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective if you and me are in the same tribe and you re not acting right then our tribe is going to suffer we have women and children to protect and provide for if you re acting in a way that indicates that you re weak i will get the urge to toughen you up i will get the urge to treat you poorly to indicate that you re low down on the dominance hierarchy and to force you to become stronger men bully and give each other a hard time to test each other and make each other stronger young boys will often wrestle each other male adolescents will tease each other mercilessly male bonding usually involves a lot of rude jokes that poke fun at each other we usually enjoy these behaviours greatly we call it banter let s say that you re insecure and experience a lot of anxiety you would most likely walk around with your head down and hoping that you just don t get noticed you don t want people to look at you you probably just want to stay invisible you would feel this way because if you re insecure having more eyes on you ramps up your anxiety levels greatly giving a speech in highschool would fill you with dread you would rely on your notes entirely and most likely shake during the speech being insecure and not thinking highly of yourself puts you in your head you re anxious about your future you feel regret about your past and insecurity about your appearance you re not in alignment at all you re using up brain capacity on all these different things and so you lack the ability to just focus on the present moment and act forthrightly alpha males and their ability to play social games the alpha male is not in his head he is in his body he is not thinking he is just acting he wouldn t need to rely on notes whilst giving a speech he could just free associate instead why is he able to do this because he thinks highly of himself he s not dwelling on the past or anxious about the future or insecure about himself he s able to have his thoughts words and actions line up fighters will clear their minds before a fight because if they re too busy thinking then that means that they re using up their finite amount of brain capacity that could be better used for fighting if you want to achieve a flow state you can t be thinking you just have to be acting so high status men are able to act in the world in a forthright manner and low status men are more inclined to stagnate and live in their heads instead alpha males are able to actually enjoy giving each other a hard time they don t take it seriously and they actually enjoy the banter they re capable of free associating and having thick skin they re able to play this social game in high school they give low status men a particularly hard time simply because it s fun to them if you asked them why they re doing it you would get a response that s something like don t worry we re just having fun that s all it is to them just fun they enjoy the game they enjoy the test they know they re good at it and so they welcome the challenge they don t shy away from people they re capable of partaking in these social games we play and winning whilst having a fun time evolution made men enjoy these games because we use it to structure the dominance hierarchy we figure out who s the alpha and who s the beta based off of their behavioural characteristics we don t create resumes for each male and measure their ability to add value to a hunter gatherer tribe we just make subconscious assessments of each other based off of our behaviours and act accordingly the dominance hierarchy is very much linked to who can banter and free associate and who cannot social games and shit tests we re all aware of what a shit test is it is tool that women employ to test a man s value the shit test will involve her saying or doing something that s designed to see whether or not you re better than her from a value perspective women are hypergamous so they re only attracted to men that are of higher value than they are that means that they mate across and up the dominance hierarchy if you greatly admire someone you re more likely to qualify yourself to them and pedestalise them you want their approval so you try to prove yourself to them if they insulted you in some way or indicated that they don t really like you it would affect you emotionally and it would hurt likewise if you were around someone who you didn t really care about then you wouldn t qualify yourself to them if they insulted you or indicated that they didn t really like you you probably wouldn t even remotely care we usually only want the approval of people that are better than us or are of higher value in some way so when a woman gives you a shit test your reaction to the test will indicate whether you think you re better than her or not qualifying yourself or backtracking when hearing a shit test means you re pedastalising her and wanting her approval and therefore you re not engaging her hypergamous instincts likewise if you react with indifference you re indicating that you think highly of yourself and that you don t need her and inspiring attraction in the process responding to the test with a counter test or a playful insult is the best response think of the shit test like an invitation to play a game flirting usually involves playful banter and light teasing the pickup artists called it game for a reason it s a social game you re playing and people who aren t in their heads but rather are in their bodies and think highly of themselves are particularly good at playing this game how societies create men of high value every culture all throughout human history gave their adolescent boys a rite of passage they would send their boys into the woods for a month or into a dark cave or something similar they did this to transition the adolescents from boys into men young adolescent boys are indecisive and need decisions made for them they don t like responsibility they re easily afraid and worst of all they re insecure insecurity sets in around that age you start to become really self conscious and dwell on all your short comings from a hunter gatherer perspective you re useless and not able to add value to the tribe a rite of passage would fix that problem being thrust into the unknown forces you to become decisive and courageous otherwise you won t survive it forces you to stop thinking and instead start acting it forces you to stop dwelling on your short comings and instead focus on what you re actually capable of you would exit the rite of passage with a new found confidence that experience would be something that you can point to to justify having high self esteem if you survived it you would now have a reason to think highly of yourself you would now have the behavioural characteristics that indicate that you can add value to the tribe how modern society fails men we have no rites of passage in our modern times and as a consequence men are extending their adolescence for as long as possible they indulge in all sorts of short term gratification instead for example they indulge in video games which are a life achievement simulator podcasts youtubers online forums which are a social life simulator porn which is a sex life simulator these three things are simulation versions of what men of high value get men who are acting correctly in the world are admirable and so they get a social life and a sex life and they most likely experience feelings of accomplishment what we ve done is create digital versions of these social rewards and made them accessible to all men everywhere so the incentive to grow up is greatly diminished we also have a schooling system that doesn t allow young boys to form the dominance hierarchy correctly and prevents men from learning how to act right when you get bullied the way to stop the bullying is to indicate that you re a formidable person who isn t weak they re testing you to see if you re valuable in some way you re meant to figure out how to be fierce and you re not meant to get help but rather develop the behavioural traits that command respect running to the teacher and asking for help indicates that you re not formidable and not self reliant and yet that is what is taught to young boys they re taught to not fight and to not be boisterous they re meant to just sit still and submit to the teacher they re taught to ignore all their biological impulses and not help each other grow as a consequence the dominance hierarchy stays static and doesn t move the dominance hierarchy exists to make men grow and to ensure that the men at the bottom aren t always the same men the boys at the bottom stay on the bottom throughout their entire school lives never being taught that they need to grow strong and become formidable men go to very dark places when they stay at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy for years on end most young men also have parents that don t push their sons enough fathers should routinely encourage their sons to go out into the world and conquer it fathers should also stop the mother from coddling the son too much so that the son can enter the world and take risks and grow as an individual who doesn t need help parents need to foster independence and they aren t doing a very good job of that in recent years how men make women feel when justin bieber or brad pitt go onto a talk show every woman in the audience screams and loses their minds when one direction roles into town women chase them and throw their panties at them whereas when jessica alba or ariana grande goes onto a talk show the men just sit and clap women view the top percent of men with reverence they throw themselves at them but the corollary to that is that they view the bottom percent of men with disdain and contempt the reason for this is simple if you look at it from an evolutionary perspective women are the selectors they decide who gets to propagate their genes and who doesn t nature is that which selects and women select hence the term mother nature if women run for the hills from low value men and throw themselves at high value men that ensures that only the right men will have children this is why women are the gatekeepers of sex women are the egg and men are the sperm men can have hundreds of kids a year ie genghis khan women can only have one barring twins etc it makes complete sense that they re brutal when it comes to selecting men it also explains why women care way more about sexual assault and sexual harassment this is a very important point if i m on a train and i feel a hand on my ass and i look over and i see a women who s around my size groping me i most likely will feel flattered and just laugh i may even tell my friends about it and brag about it from an emotional perspective i won t care however if i m a woman on a train and i feel a hand on my ass and i look over and see a man of identical size groping me i will feel violated i will feel scared and humiliated it would be a horrible experience the reason for this difference in reaction is because women decide who gets to have sex and who doesn t they re the gatekeepers of sex this is exactly where their power lies if you override who ability to select you and just grope her you just took her power away from her it isn t just the size difference between men and women that explains why they care more about sexual assault it s the fact that they re the selectors men are apathetic towards ugly women but low value men make women innately uncomfortable at a cellular level remember this fact comfort and what women want earlier in this piece i mentioned that men offer women both value and comfort comfort is your willingness to commit and be monogamous it is your ability to provide for her and protect her women have a desire for comfort because in hunter gatherer societies they would die without male protection especially during and after pregnancy but men who offer women comfort right from the start get friend zoned and never get laid why because value and comfort are roughly inversely correlated men game women for sex and women game men for commitment a women who gives you sex quickly is less likely to get your commitment a man who gives his comfort too quickly will get a woman s time and emotions ie be a shoulder to cry on but no sex men of high value have options they have multiple women that they can seduce and sleep with the more options a man has the less likely he is to commit to one girl a women s fantasy is to get the guy that all women want but he wants just her she wants to get the commitment from the guy that has options that s what twilight is the handsome vampire with impossibly high value that all women want but he just can t get this plain jane out of his head he lusts after this boring plain jane she s not like other girls that s a woman s fantasy that s what shades of grey is also handsome billionaire impossibly high value infatuated with a plain jane that all women can project themselves onto she s wants to have to game him by being desirable and feminine to secure his commitment women love feeling feminine they love feeling petite and submissive they want to feel desirable but they can t just snap their fingers and induce this feeling within themselves they require a high value man to evoke that feeling from within her if she has no high value man in her life then she won t ever be able to feel truly feminine desirable submissive etc without high value men around her she won t act in a way that s desirable to men compliance tests women test a man s value with shit tests but they also test comfort they test comfort by giving men compliance tests aka comfort tests compliance tests are far more nefarious and harder to spot then shit tests they are far more pervasive but they must be understood because they re more relevant now then they ve ever been let s say that you re a guy who works out works hard at his job has a lot of cool friends and has a lot of cool hobbies you re an in shape ambitious guy with a great social life you re a catch you then get a girlfriend she will begin to give you compliance tests in order to test your comfort here s some examples to illustrate what compliance tests are you don t need to work out so much i kind of prefer guys with softer bellies it s nicer to cuddle with besides you could hurt yourself at the gym why do you work such long hours you re so tired when you get home and we can never spend any meaningful time together you always spend your weekends with your friends instead of me it s like you prefer them over me do you not like spending time with me kayaking is way too dangerous you re going to hurt yourself plus it s so expensive let s find activities that we can do together instead now a year later you re out of shape because you stopped working out you re no longer ambitious because you stopped grinding you no longer have friends and you no longer have cool hobbies and so now your girlfriend is no longer attracted to you but the reason she s no longer attracted to you isn t because you re an out of shape loser with no friends but rather it s because you failed her compliance tests the compliance tests are designed to lower your value to ensure your commitment she s taking away the things that make you attractive to increase your comfort when you fail a compliance test by bending the knee you re indirectly communicating to her saying i m not high value i don t have options i need you because i can t get other women i will do whatever it takes to make you happy remember we seek the approval of the people we pedastalise and women are hypergamous and aren t attracted to men that pedastalise them because it indicates that your value is lower than hers so when you fail a compliance test you re letting her control you because you think it will make her happy but you re actually indicating a lack of abundance and by extension of that low value now because you re no longer attractive to her you no longer evoke feelings of femininity and desirability from within her you once made her feel submissive and sexy but now you don t only high value men can do that she no longer feels how she wants to feel she wants to dote on you she wants to be cute and look at you lovingly she wants to have a symbiotic relationship with you where she serves you and treats you amazingly it used to bring her great joy to bring you joy but she can t actually experience any of that unless you actually evoke those feelings from within her and you can only do that if you re high value compliance testing starts small and only escalates once you fail it will start at tiny things like getting you to do some more chores or letting her check your messages or forgoing some activity in order to to some other activity with her the more you yield the greater the compliance test after a while if you keep bending the knee you re suddenly replacing sex with massages doing most of the chores giving up your drums because they re too loud spending all your money on her letting her not pay rent at all letting her walk all over you women will act as bad as you let them but they don t want to have to act that wayf they want to feel feminine and submissive but only high value men can evoke those feelings if you continually fail compliance tests you will start to evoke feelings of disdain and contempt from within her why because women view low value men with disdain and contempt and since you re failing these compliance tests you re low value if you want your girlfriend or wife to act a right then you have to act right you cannot demand respect you have to command respect the feeling of femininity and desirability that you evoke from within her is how she games you remember women game men for commitment she games you by acting in a sexy submissive and feminine way she wants to have to act this way in order to keep you around she will act as bad as you let her let her game you she wants to game you she wants to have to earn your commitment never forget this the consequence of a world filled with low value men most men nowadays are weak they don t pursue meaning they live from craving to craving they bitch moan and complain a lot they don t have an allegiance to anything at all they prefer to talk about their feelings rather than implement solutions they don t take risks they can t maintain their composure in stressful situations they choose the simulation version of social rewards over pursuing the real thing more and more men are low value the number of high value men in western countries is diminishing very very quickly as a consequence of this women are surrounded by low value men they re surrounded by men that make them feel uncomfortable on a cellular level they don t like low value men even looking at them or getting any form of sexual gratification from them in any way at all it repulses them what they do want from these low value men is comfort remember low value men give comfort way too quickly women expect low value men to be the shoulder to cry on to be the beta male that serves them to provide for her but never get any sexual gratification from her the metoo campaign is a macro level compliance test designed to regulate the sexual behaviour of low value men and to also get low value men to regulate each others sexual behaviour women want low value men to provide comfort without ever getting sex this is ideal for them they want to ensure that these men will ask for consent every step of the way and be incredibly hesitant to ever escalate and be hyper vigilant of ever trespassing against her sexually and to get these men to monitor other men s behaviours so they can regulate each other it s all a compliance test but on a macro level but remember compliance tests start small and only escalate once the man has failed the first ones feminism is ramping up it s compliance testing because men continually bend the knee and yield to these tests this is just the next level and it won t ever stop it never stops compliance testing never stops even when you re a shell of your former self and are only used for the money you provide with no thanks it still continues you pass a compliance test by not bending the knee you maintain an abundance mentality so that you won t be willing to completely change who you are in order to keep her around you maintain a frame that indirectly communicates that if she doesn t act right you ll leave because you have options what men need to do if women see a low status male not bending the knee and is instead railing against women in some way they see an unruly slave they see a man not doing what he s supposed to do they see a man that s attempting to demand respect instead of commanding respect what happens when a slave is unruly the slave master cracks the whip even harder a lot of the men in the anti feminist camp fall under this category feminists are seeing what they believe are low value men who are refusing the bend the knee this doesn t suddenly make these men value value it just makes them unruly slaves high value men don t spend their time arguing with feminists online or watching feminist cringe videos or anything like that high value men are off acting within the world not wasting their youth arguing with idiots so when women encounter these anti feminist men all they see is a low status unruly male not doing what he s told the anti feminist guys aren t really helping that much in regards to turning the tide around when it comes to feminism and all the chaos it s created the only men the only men that can turn the tide around are men of high value when women see mgtow they don t see high value men that are refusing to date them they just see low value men saying you can t fire me i quit they just don t care low value men doing anything other then bending the knee just annoys women it s not going to change their mind only high value men can do that only high value men can evoke feminine and desirable behaviours from women women will often imprint on their partners politics and beliefs once she s with a man that s she s attracted to i once heard a quote that was something like a woman won t have time for feminism if she has a hard dick chasing her around at night and it s entirely true women don t act right unless men act right you want her to be feminine and desirable well then you need to be a high value man you need to be a formidable risk taker you need to be able to banter and play the game well only then will you evoke that side of her all women are fully capable of being both loving and doting partners and also cruel and emasculating shrews the side of her that s brought out into the world is entirely dependent on the men she s around what side have they earned many men nowadays are railing against feminism they don t like what they re seeing and they try to fight back against it but they re going about it all wrong how can you expect women on a macro scale to act right if men on a macro scale won t act right you can t demand respect you have to command respect it s should be self evident as to why feminism is ramping up in recent years it s simply because men aren t acting right they re hardly men they re boys they re weak and women are responding exactly how nature intended the antidote to this is for men to recognise on an individual level that they need to do away with their peter pan syndrome and start behaving like their ancestors i walk down the street and see men with glazed over eyes who would have very little recourse if somebody decided to impose their will against them these men don t deserve the loving doting side of women only men who have tested themselves and become formidable and competent deserve that side of women in order for men to become who they were meant to become had they been reared correctly the need to create a rite of passage for themselves on an individual level recognise that there s a part of you that s resentful and angry and wants to impose your will against others tame this side of you integrate your shadow take up martial arts you ll learn to control this part of you so that you can leverage it voluntarily if somebody tries to trespass against you approach women to test yourself against nature take social risks and practice maintaining your composure whilst doing it routinely do things where you don t know what the outcome will be stop using porn podcasts shows and food to run from all your negative thoughts you have to accept your shortcomings that you have no control over you have no other choice you need to stop dwelling on your past regrets and instead re frame them as lessons that made you a stronger person it s vital that men do these things and stop being weak we have no other option a woman s love respect and loyalty is one of the most valuable things in this world it s something that all men seek you don t get to have it by default you have to earn it you have to prove yourself you have to communicate that you re a capable individual who can play the game well who has brought themselves into alignment and is acting how nature intended them to act without men acting right women won t act right you can t just complain about feminism and the current societal standards you can t demand change you can only command change the more we fail these compliance tests the further into chaos we descend by and large men get what they deserve when it comes to women if all the men in the world started to act right a lot of these problems would dissipate the nihilistic attitude in this sub is a dead end it s weakness it s an avoidance of responsibility you re a node that s within a network and so everything you do ripples out and effects the world in some way you re going to meet a thousand people in your life and they re each going to meet a thousand people that means you re only one person away from a million people and two people away from a billion you have more influence then you think start doing what you know you should be doing
14628,so during my hiatus i would pop into the sub from time to time and check out some of the posts sometimes i would find some real gold and learn a lot or reassess my own knowledge more often than not the sub would be full of horseshit crappy unedited streams of dribble parroting long established side bar knowledge humble brag field reports look at me i am important too articles imitating popular posts and contributors often these posts would be upvoted a lot too by guys who didn t really know much better and they would be left on the frontpage for all the world to think and judge us for and for newbies to get corrupted by i don t blame the mods they have more important things to do than sit around curating posts all day they have lives too but they work very hard anyway in fact the front page would be unreadable without them i do blame the attention seekers who post this shit though and their upvote enablers too in fact if you would like to help the mods out in keeping the sub clean i suggest all you lurkers or guys who never vote actually start upvoting the posts you like a long time ago i used to be guilty of this too i would read a great post yet not actually upvote it out of apathy or forgetfulness now i make a point to upvote everything of value i see you need to do this too as it helps separate the wheat from the chaff and teaches the newbies and lurkers what the real content actually is and what is just dribble anyway i m probably being a bit too harsh on you guys i realise a lot of you are young or new to this whole writing thing or non english speakers i d like to help you improve writing is one of the most important things you can do for your own personal growth it takes the disjointed thoughts and ideas that grow and die in your head and gives them form in words sharing a part of your soul with others to teach and entertain it s really quite amazing and should be something we all do if you don t at least have a personal diary by now start one for that reason i wanted to make a guide on how to actually write well now i ain t no expert but i ve learnt a lot over the years through experience and have made some pretty good posts that have aligned well with people here so i ll let you decide for yourself whether you re willing to take advice from me just like everything the best way to get good at writing is to practice practice practice and suck at it for a while first heck had any of you read my first few reddit posts under a different account years ago you d be laughing me out of the sub so read my guide and practice doesn t have to be for redpill posts specifically but i do expect some of you to actually give it a shot and post your articles on the subreddit for us to judge genuine insight now one of the most important things i ve realised as i ve written is that there s no substitute for genuine novel insight you can present the most well written verbose passionate piece ever but if it doesn t actually have anything of quality to it if it doesn t teach the reader anything new if it doesn t spark an a ha in the reader then you have not achieved anything conversely there are many posts on the subreddit and that i ve written too that are sloppy and disjointed and unedited and lazy yet do very well because they teach the reader something new it s just like how some of my favourite youtubers are ugly or cringey and beta but their videos have genuine insight to them so i let it slide or how some bands can produce an amazing one hit song then never make anything good ever again genuine quality stands on its own two feet there s no way to dress up bad content to make it look better regardless of fancy tricks and techniques people always see through it so when you decide you want to write something think about whether what you re about to say actually has any value to it whether you will change any lives or teach something new do not write for the sake of writing u whisper put it very succinctly in his post first post syndrome where he called out the guys who were posting just so they can get their name on the subreddit are you writing for attention are you writing for upvotes are you writing to cause drama none of these things will do well for you readers will see through your bullshit they want to be taught and entertained so if you fuck them around they won t give you the time of day so when writing an article for the subreddit are you doing one of these things if not are you bringing anything of value to the readers or are you like a pride parade faggot shaking your feathered ass just for people to look write with your inner voice whenever my plates or friends read any of my posts the most common comment i get is wow this sounds exactly like you in fact i write almost exactly the way i speak i pause in my speech a lot to think and give the listener time to process and also to add rhythm sometimes however i go on long rambling lines of thought to add speed and urgency and weight to my words inflection and lists used to add emphasis to important points often i use beats the important thing to notice here is that your writing will sound much more natural if you avoid trying to sound like a writer do not try and write what you think a writer should write like do not imitate your favourite authors do not use big words and phrases you would otherwise never use in your speech your writing should be a projection of your inner voice onto the page when reading back your work does it sound like something you would actually say would you be able to get up in front of people and speak your work and have it sound natural readers will very quickly pick up on fake writing your inner voice reads much more natural on the page and will hook the reader much better than a manufactured voice you copied from somewhere else also realise that reader s tastes have changed and attention spans have decreased you won t be able to pull off a verbose and sophisticated imitation anymore you ll just bore the redditors keep up with the times and make it punchy get down with the fellow kids you may have realised i use a lot of slang in my posts or expletives or abbreviations it helps befriend the reader and makes them feel like you re on their level part of their culture write the shit you would want read when i first came to this subreddit i was blown away by the level of analysis and advice and discussion on women the sexual marketplace and hypergamy i learnt a lot and quickly picked it up the sidebar is a goldmine and is all a newbie really needs to swallow the pill although it can be a bit daunting sometimes one of my favourite posts in the sidebar confessions of a reformed incel is a long rambling emotional post where the writer tells us about his life and his transformation it is well written angry and bitter and you can feel the writer s personality seep through the page i really liked it i felt like i knew the guy experienced his rage it really opened my eyes and pushed me to sort my shit out sometimes posts like these would appear on the front page and those were my favourite i really enjoyed reading about the lives of redpilled guys and their interactions with women the detailed funny angry field reports were great there was also a lot about women but not a lot about men a lot about lifting but not much on further self improvement i realised when i began writing that there was no need for me to try and compete with the sidebar or rollo or im or any of the other established guys on here they had their niches locked down and who needs more regurgitated sidebar content all the info is already there why repeat it over and over i realised i could teach in a different way it didn t necessarily need to be articles i started writing stories and posts on male self actualisation the kind of shit i enjoyed and wanted to read and the kind of shit i thought was missing in the sub i didn t do well at first but as my writing improved so did my popularity it seemed that others liked and needed these kinds of posts as well when writing a post think to yourself would i click on this and upvote is this the kind of thing that i feel the sub needs would this entertain me personally title is the most important it needs to be clickbait now sadly the most important part of your entire post will be the title you can write for days and craft a perfect article but if the title doesn t hook anyone no one will read it click bait is a necessary evil especially if you want your efforts to be rewarded on our subreddit too you also have to compete with other articles stealing reader s limited attention and endorsed vanguard posts who automatically have more weight and pull to them your title should hint at what your post is about without giving it all away it should be enigmatic enough anybody scrolling past would be too anxious not to click on they should want to feel like they re missing out by skipping past it use buzzwords that generate interest or leave it open ended like a newspaper title do not title your post you should do xyz and here s why or any other you should you must everyone should etc and do not give away your entire post as a tl dr in the title use structural tools to make it look pretty and easy to read structure is super important in this aspect too how often have you opened a post only to see a wall of text with no paragraphs or formatting and thought nope you must make it easy for your reader they don t want to feel like it s a chore to read your work use bolds and italics to spice up your lines vary your sentence lengths use lists headings and subheadings quote blocks bullet points and line breaks jazz it up so that the reader always feels like the reading is no effort at all just one more paragraph they think until they realise they ve just finished a post that hit the reddit wordcount keep your paragraphs varied do some analysis in one and then maybe a mini field report or story in the next and then back to analysis and then maybe some humour and then a quote you need to take your reader on a rollercoaster keep that dopamine train going don t masturbate another new mindset to adopt is that you are performer your article is a performance for your reader and it is your job to keep them entertained and engaged throughout your reader doesn t owe you shit just because you made a good post before or they opened this post and read half of it already does not mean they will actually finish it should it begin to bore them the biggest crime a writer can commit is boring his reader some guys begin by telling their life story from when they were years old to when they found trp realise this now no one cares guys aren t here to indulge in your masturbation they re here to learn from you we re a team sharing notes after all if you can t give them what they want they will disappear it is your duty to ensure that from start to finish your reader wants to keep reading your post wants to see it through to the end often i find myself reading a post that started strong but getting bored halfway through due to rambling leaving for something else more stimulating and that s the important point you must keep your reader stimulated and entertained your post cannot be monotonous and your reader needs to feel like he is learning something new with every new paragraph avoid repeating yourself each paragraph should extend your point further all leading up to the general conclusion if you re repeating yourself pick the best sounding sentences that fit together and delete the rest entertain the reader it is vital that you keep your reader entertained throughout if they are not entertained they will not internalise the core message i understand that some writers are very good at presenting cold analysis and making it easy to digest i am unable to do that i need to have emotionality and humour in my work if you cannot take them on a ride of emotions your reader will get bored your post should be fun to read it should not feel like a chore it should be funny and interesting or hard hitting your reader will know within the first few paragraphs whether they will see it through to the end normally you are a performer and your reader needs to come out of the post feeling like they got something valuable from giving up their time to read your work whether it s new knowledge or a few chuckles the important thing to know about emotional writing and making your readers laugh is that the harder you try the more you will fail these are tricky techniques to employ and readers don t like to feel like they re being manipulated it needs to be natural and so when writing do not attempt to force humour or emotions into the text if you have something genuine to say and write well with your inner voice it will shine through without you noticing when i would get comments from guys saying they found my work funny i would be genuinely surprised that wasn t my intention but it kind of just happened anyway know your audience who are you writing for on this subreddit you are writing for beta men men who are in the middle of their self improvement journey and kids who were lucky enough to stumble upon the correct answers early your readers are normally dopamine addicted low attention span men also neurotic and emotional men who like to rebel and push boundaries and a lot of kids highschoolers and college students some of you seem to hate the fact we have children on our sub i think it s a great thing how many of you wished you were taught this stuff early before you fucked up your lives these kids while a bit cringey and spergy are actually the smartest of their generation they found this place and didn t fight against it were brave enough to separate themselves from the herd of masturbating video game playing weed addicts and accept the misogynist label you should be proud of them even if they make retard baby comments take all this into account write to keep them stimulated else they will find a meme or game to occupy their time instead appeal to their sense of rebellion and anger at the world befriend your reader make them like you not hard to do if you present yourself as genuine teach them important novel insights and show your altruism you do not want to come across too pushy or arrogant or superior would your reader feel like he can actually have an enjoyable conversation with you in person over a drink if yes you ve done your job well use rhythm to make your writing poetic rhythm is very important and is a structural technique that adds character to your piece your writing should have a poetic quality to it this makes it easier and more enjoyable to read use a mix of long and short sentences and use lots of commas vary your sentence and paragraph lengths your writing needs to be musical it is a song the list of three is a technique that is probably the only good thing i ever learned from high school english class it consists of grouping your points into three clusters adds rhythm to your writing and ends the list on a solid stop it helps make your prose seem more comprehensive adds flow and tempo and gives your sentences intonation it is also very important to use beats stops in your writing that stress and emphasise a point and generate tone shifts how do you use a beat like this tell the truth but lie a little bit speak the truth readers will pick up on your bullshit do not lie is your field report entirely made up we ll know we ll almost always know it shows in your writing without you being aware people have more intuition than they like to believe and they can generally feel when they re being fucked around do not bullshit your readers you may get away with it a few times but they will quickly pick up on what your lies sound like your posts will do much better if you actually just tell the truth about your life and what happened you may think you can teach better by making up scenarios or stories to prove a point but you re really harming yourself and others more that way if it didn t actually happen don t write a whole post about it however and as always there s an exception you should lie a little bit if your lies can be small and white and boost the entertainment value or readability of your post you should remember the most important rule is to keep your reader stimulated and entertained if fibbing a few times in the post helps keep them reading adds colour makes them laugh and gets them to the core message better then i personally think its excusable your story does not have to be a documentary it does not have to be an accurate retelling add some colour and frills to it you re a performer after all think of a great comeback to that shit test the next day in the shower use it anyway conversation was long and boring and had too many details shorten it into something more digestible making up an entirely new character by mashing together other characters good for keeping the story clean and concise i don t lie much in my posts but when i do it s for the sake of cleaning up the post and not making it a slog to push through for example in a field report if i have girl a who gave me some great shit tests and girl b who taught me about hypergamy brutally normally i just fuse them into a new girl c and talk about this new imaginary girl but only if this girl c is a quick example never as the topic of an entire post it keeps me from having to bounce between names or write multiple paragraphs and it teaches the concepts just as well and cleans up the post to make it easier to read in my one of those days post my argument with the locksmith actually went on for a while as we discussed prices and money and options but fuck that would have been boring and monotonous for the post so i condensed it into something snappy and it worked just try not to get caught in the lie it s always embarrassing when this happens i ve been caught a few times it can ruin your whole post if your white lie is caught no reader wants to feel like he s being duped if you are going to lie the lie should be small enough that should it be caught it doesn t really matter much for the post overall if your lie fucks with the whole post it s too big and importantly and once again only lie for entertainment and legibility value the rest of your post should actually be true actually be things that happened if it s not you re doing a disservice to yourself the people reading and the universe at large you re painting a picture of a world that doesn t actually exist leading others astray for what so you can get your orange envelopes you know that s not fair on you and everyone else the bad karma will catch up to you eventually if it didn t really happen don t pretend it did sleep on it and cull i have a confession to make i used to post first drafts horrifying i know don t do this first drafts are almost always horrible i did so because i wanted the immediate gratification of the orange crack not realising that it harmed the purpose of the post overall to hand in a shitty essay often i would wake up the next morning and read over the post and just cringe hard your first draft will always be sloppy it will be a spew of verbal vomit with everything in it as it should be first drafts are for writing down everything you can think of and may be important you want to shit out all your ideas even if they re not that great don t limit yourself on your second pass you will cut all the crap and may find you are able to expand on and improve on lines that weren t fully formed initially once you re done with your first draft do not post it immediately i know it s tempting but hold back you can always make it better the first thing to do is sleep on it you will return to it in the morning and find a lot of bullshit that you can cut out entirely there will be a lot of waffle you didn t see in your first write that s okay just cut that shit in fact you will probably need to go into full on cull mode especially if you re a rambler distil your post into its core message do this a couple more times and i suggest waiting at least a week before posting i ve come back to a post after weeks once and still edited it heavily and it did very well sometimes though you may read over a post and think this is just bad how did i ever write this you will then have to just kill it entirely it s painful but good practice to get into the habit of don t post garbage it fucks with your reputation ignore the haters if you make any kind of good post there will always be salty commenters the most common one i get is this is too long mostly from lazy kids who are only here to masturbate and get their rage porn dopamine fix if your post doesn t give them their high within paragraphs they get mad these are also the kind of guys that still don t read books i purposefully don t make short posts for this reason in my effort to try and fix the world one word at a time i m in the practice of helping guys learn to just sit and read for a while next will be all the people telling you that everything you said was a lie especially if it s a field report this used to irk me a lot but now i realise why they do it their lives are boring and interesting things don t actually happen to them they don t approach women and they don t often leave their room so when they read posts like these they think they re bullshit because in their jealousy they refuse to believe there are guys who actually lead interesting lives or have the balls to game women so that s when you get all the this is just neckbeard fantasy or lol at the state of this subreddit bullshit they also miss the point of the entire post itself whether its fiction or not the point of the post is to teach entertain and guide but they are so caught up in its perceived validity they miss the lessons and the insights often these people never actually contribute posts to the subreddit anyway try checking their post histories you ll find some good cringe oh and there s also the this sub has gone to shit which we ve had literally from the sub s inception and this is not what i come here for from entitled guys with high standards expecting every single post to be side bar worthy oh and once again never contribute themselves you can t actually do much about these comments if you attempt to deer you just come out looking weaker they will never be satisfied anyway they ve made up their mind that nothing ever happens before they ve even opened your post the best you can do is accept they ll be there accept they re the kind of angry pessimists that are prone to complaining about their life and whining and silently smile to yourself knowing that no matter how snarky their comments how angry they get they are wrong because you ve genuinely lived the story have direction and wrap it up your post should have a clear direction from beginning to end it is a journey with ups and downs and twists and turns start with an intro to lube your readers up fuck them brutally during the midsection and afterwards soothe them gently make them feel loved and nurtured content with themselves in the conclusion as you write hint at concepts you will discuss later in the post bring back previous ideas you introduced earlier and have a clear flow of purpose your post should be a road leading to a conclusion and your conclusion should always hit hard enough that your reader actually stops and thinks afterwards doesn t immediately go to a new tab maybe decides to comment on the post and wants to do something with his life after give your readers a call to action at the end encourage them to attempt the thing you just taught them ask them to re asses their lives your post needs a purpose so make it clear what the lessons are at the end and the important things they should take away sometimes bullet points highlighting the key ideas are very helpful gt genuine insight is king gt gt write the way you speak gt gt write the things you would want to read gt gt you are a perfomer you must keep your reader entertained gt gt your title is your success limiting step gt gt rhythm and poetry keeps your reader reading gt gt always tell the truth but lie a bit for entertainment s sake gt gt sleep on your work

destination it s the journey
14811,i have been self conscious unsure unprepared and unknowing of what to do around women for most of my life i m an only child raised by a single father who never had relationships as he was equally as bad with women since my childhood i ve done many things i ve bought a house a dream car had a great relationship that lasted just around years and also got into my dream career working professionally as a dj nights a week recently i have had a big break and have entered into the biggest night clubs around at first i lacked confidence and was nervous after weeks of playing in these clubs my confidence has gotten higher and higher i also realised that being a dj only gets your foot in the door with women you need to be up to speed and walk the walk and talk the talk i soon learned that if i was going to get anywhere with women i needed to practise and work on bettering myself up until these last two weeks i had always felt inadequate around women i m just below average height and have always felt like an imposter in the night club scene even though i m the main dj everyone around me appears to be cool when i feel like i m pretending i have just ended my year relationship and decided to put myself out there for the first time in my life everything has changed for me it s been night and day and all i did was tweak a few things after reading some posts on this reddit sub i thought i was boring before and that even though i was in a relationship women didn t want to talk to me that made me feel rejected i wasn t sure of my worth and often felt that if i ended the relationship no girl would want me but i just realised that women weren t talking to me or giving me attention because i had been in a relationship i was so wrong how could i have not known lol after reading a few tips on here i changed my approach and the last two weekends have been crazy here s what i ve learned you are the prize literally you are a man and at first glance that s exactly who you are women are insecure and they worry about looks and they live in a paradigm where women everywhere are being absolute fucking trash bitches to them all the time literally a peak into a woman s world especially in a night club is like a fucking war zone hats off to the girls who put up with it after going out and speaking to women i have noticed a few things you are judged straight away correct me if i m wrong but single horny women will want to fuck most decent looking men right up until these guys open their stupid mouths does that make sense you are a yes right up until you make yourself a no and it only takes one stupid sentence to fuck up your chances i noticed this because last friday night i had spotted an instagram model who had actually been on the first dates tv show in australia i approached her and asked if she was the girl from tv then in the conversation i dropped that i was the dj i didn t have much experience at this point with women and this was a learning curve for me hence the advice looking back i could tell she was scanning the fuck out of me subconsciously scanning my frame level of eye contact confidence levels etc i m a handsome guy when i am done up but i wouldn t say i m hot and i especially don t believe i am the chris hemsworth character that these s usually desire to fuck looking back now i can tell i could ve fucked her if i had played my cards right instead her friend came up and joined her and i i got stuck talking to her friend who mind me was absolutely gorgeous but was in no way was a hot down to fuck instagram model who would let you do lines of cocaine off her tits while you fucked her in the her ass after talking to her friend who was completely oblivious that she had cock blocked me the model had found a tall meat head that was nearby to latch onto we all ended up hanging out and i made out with her flight attendant friend i got her number messaged her the next day never got a reply that s okay lesson learned what to make of that confidence is everything eye contact is everything frame is everything it is also absolutely important to not have your blinders on when going for a girl make sure to take care of her friends first and for god s sake don t let your guard down around her friends or they will take her away from you even if you have done everything right with the girl you re after also don t get stuck in conversation with women you don t want because the girl you re after will most likely think you want her friend more advice you will know within the first seconds of meeting someone if they re attracted to you or not you can pick up on the subtle cues and body language pretty quickly you are white noise to some women you don t exist that s okay you do the same thing to women every day lol other women will spend time scanning the fuck out of you which is what happened with the ig model i believe she was thinking he s not my usual type but he seems important which is weird so i would fuck him because he s important but i need to shit test and validate this guy to make sure he walks the walk and talks the talk if he s going to get any piece of me also some girls are more confident than others obviously but in this sense some will make it obvious that they like you and others will just want you to lead the way i mean some girls are outspoken and will tell you that you re hot and others more shy girls will make it obvious that they like you by continuing to talk to you by finding your jokes funny by subtle body language cues etc take her company and her levels of engagement as a compliment and a yes signal i also noticed last saturday night that at nightclubs a lot of women there are complete trash the hotter ones are trashier and will do anything as long as you go about it the right way i mean in those environments everyone is young boys and girls are horny and everyone loves sex it helps to know and understand how absolute trash women can be most men never realise this but the epiphany is the difference between dating a woman and having the same girl on call for sex whenever you want you ever watched porn hot girls get hot so they can be fucked be nasty and use their looks and superior social skills over beta men to withdraw money and get spoiled don t ever be the fucking beta i am telling you from a guy who has been a short porn watching beta right until i broke up my year relationship and started putting myself out there go to the gym eat healthy save your sperm don t watch porn don t put women on a pedestal don t glorify them be nice and lovely to be around but also act in a way that you know they are complete trash and that you will fuck their brains out once they get over their stupid fucking games of trying to shit test you never indulge in bullshit shit testing in nightclubs it pays to know people and have validation by people you know walking by it props your status and worth up i can do this because i m meeting more people as the dj this helps but i would suggest meeting some people throughout the night remember their names then if luck is on your side you ll be talking to a girl and someone will walk past and you can say hey bro let s still go for that drink later signing off with a bro handshake you might never see him again but she will think you re connected when meeting chicks it helps to bro down with one and have her want to introduce you to her single friend massive help but this just another card in your arsenal previously i had been unaware and been doing the opposite to all of these things i ve always gotten close as a dj but had never been able to secure the end goal two weeks ago everything changed i met a chick i knew she was attracted to me in fact she made it obvious and told me i was hot etc i had no idea how the fuck i was going to go from that comment to fucking her but alas i did my best after chatting for a while and dancing with her and her friend we eventually went and did cocaine in the bathroom she was a dental nurse and wanted to see my teeth she put her fingers in my mouth lol while checking out my smile seconds in i thought fuck this and i grabbed her chin her hands were already around my head so we were in the perfect position to make out i mean as well everything was there for the taking two people in a bathroom in a night club doing cocaine and the female already has said i m hot i just needed to get my shit together and make it happen we made out we then ended up in the back of my car doing coke and fucking for and a half hours before i made her catch a taxi home i got her number but never messaged her back why she was hot good ass good pussy great blowjob but she was looking for a fuck buddy and i could tell this girl was going to be a clinger it doesn t take a moron to know that fuck buddies are only good if they don t need you because they re unable to get laid so that weekend was a wrap this weekend even better i was at work a random girl off the street walked in came up to me started dancing and rubbing her ass on my dick she put my hands on her ass and it was clear as day that i couldn t fucked her her breath stank so bad and she was a in her drunk state at best complete trash security kicked her out but it boosted my confidence for the rest of the night later that night these girls entered the venue this girl was coming up for song requests as a dj you soon pick up on if they actually want a song or if it s just an excuse to come and talk and to scan and validate you for a potential fuck she was a her friends were gross too but i wanted to see if advice that i read here on reddit would work and if i could get her to want me we started talking and i could tell she had started trying to shit test me asking me where im going to next i said another night club and mentioned which one she said she would like to come but doesn t want her or her friends to pay entry i stared at her and said i m not gonna to get you in for free i actually have no idea who you are i m getting other people in for free but definitely not you i don t know you i said it while looking directly in her eyes with a big smile at the end the cut your fucking bullshit smile the you re not winning that easily smile she took a step back and said rude with a puzzled look and the she walked back to her friends this was the first moment i had realised that i am the prize and it was up to me to leverage that guys previously i would ve been a pushover and offered her and her friends a free ride and free entry etc i would ve put myself out there just to have any chance with a woman never do that literally after reading this thread i realised that i was the prize and so i acted like it boys she could not make it anymore obvious how much she wanted me after that she was dirty dancing right beside bending over and shaking her ass in my direction coming up to ask for song requests trying to get really close to me in the process then failing and walking back to her friends while they all had a communal chat about me staring at me constantly i had won this chick needed my validation after that and i know she would ve used her pussy to do that lol i did not rock up to the club with a group to year old s and s but i did learn about what it meant to value yourself and that you are the prize thank you reddit so at the club i was on the dance floor when i noticed this hot by herself she didn t know i was a dj or anything which makes me more happy about this she was absolute model material my exact type tight butt tight tummy long brunette tanned european and exotic looking i started dancing by myself fuck it i did like the music and i wasn t there with anyone else anyway she saw me and bumped into me and told me how drunk she was i just looked at her and said cool with an unimpressed look in my eyes and tone of my voice i mean what the fuck would i have done with that information say great let s go back to your house so you can spit into my mouth and i can lick your asshole no that information gives me fuck all i went and got a drink from the bar and came back i saw some people i had met last weekend walk by and we shook hands etc had small talk kept dancing that was the moment of having women see that you know people and realise you re not a random alone loser but that you re connected at this point she was still by herself all of her friends were dancing but she wasn t i could see her glancing over i went up and asked if she had any cigarettes she didn t i stepped back and kept dancing and she came over and told me she was drunk again i had my hands around her waist i then grabbed her hand and spun her around seconds later her friends came in for the swoop and took her away i didn t give a fuck i was just happy that a woman as hot as her was interested in me regardless of anything else more of a confidence boost than anything remember when i said deal with her friends but don t fuck yourself over in front of them well i had actually done that i was too friendly too one of her friends and she was the one who swooped in meh i went downstairs to a smoking area and was sitting down there when this woman asked for a lighter i let her use mine and then we began talking she was a single mum and i wasn t at all interested in her but i dropped that i was the dj i needed a cue into her group and that s my go to now lol she introduced me to her group and said she had a single friend who s outside that she could introduce me to if i was interested of course i said yes i met the girl nice year old greek woman bit taller than me fit physiotherapist who doesn t ever eat take away food we sat on the couch had a pretty relaxed conversation i made her laugh etc then i thought to myself that my window was closing and that i needed to call the elephant in the room i told her that her friend said to me that i had to kiss her or i d be in big trouble she never said that lol the girl laughed as if oh of course my friend would say that i grabbed her chin and we made out fuck me guys she was the best most erotic kisser i have ever been with the club was closing and i wanted to keep making out with her so i suggested we go to my car i took her out drove around the block we both jumped into the back seat and started kissing it got heated i ripped her pants off and ate her pussy out she gave me most amazing head while i had my fingers in her ass she swallowed and everything amazing bliss i gave her my number and said i d like to see her again and would like to go on a date she was happy and i dropped her back home reason why i gave her my number is because i got the vibe that she never really did things as bold as what we did and i wanted to give her the decision on whether or not she wants to meet up and fuck or if she wanted to decide that it was a once off for her which is okay in my books the next night rolls around saturday i m doing my thing then i spot two girls in a dm in the smokers area i approached anyway and asked if they had a lighter i borrowed it asked if i could sit down then i turned my body away and let them chat eventually i turned back and interrupted their conversation it was boring as fuck i could hear it haha i started talking to them one girl was a and the other was a i read this situation so well thanks again to reddit and advice i had read i dropped that i was a dj and i instantly got open body language from the boom her whole body framed up towards my direction i flirted with her a little and then i turned to the and gave her some attention i could see the getting absolutely frustrated her inner bitch wanted me and couldn t handle her ugly duckling friend having my attention i played this so well i mean imagine being a chick who gets all done up perfect body perfect ass and tits gorgeous face to be talking to the main dj in the nightclub to then be in a position where her ugly friend is getting more attention way to drive a girl fucking nuts eventually when i started talking to the again she managed to mention her vagina several times in the conversation good on her set the tone well i could tell she was absolute trash as i offered her some of my beer and she said that beer gives her vagina thrush great one now i know you re nasty as fuck too at this point i had to go and dj so i left i went to the bathroom went and got a drink then headed to the stage i spotted her with another guy while walking to the stage i touched her head and made eye contact with her and gave her a smile she squeezed my arm and i rubbed her arm back as i was walking off it s that subtle we both find each other attractive and no one else knows technique guys that combined with our conversation earlier was pretty much an instant fuck me cue i didn t see her when i finished my set but i know that she will find me there some other time and i ll take her trashy mouthed girl home and fuck her brains into paradise one for the books after the club i met some girls outside of course their guards were up high any guys who approach at that time want one thing sex women at that time are extremely suss on anyone who approaches at the same time if they meet the right guy and they re more horny and not tired and aren t held down by tired friends then game on so i started talking to this girl eye contact was everything here we had good banter she was attractive but i felt no chemistry that was okay i validated my manliness too her through good eye contact good frame and keeping a stable and deep voice i ended up driving her and her friends to another club and i decided i was going to use those girls as leverage to meet other women that completely worked thanks again reddit i never wouldn t thought this way beforehand i ended up meeting this stripper i didn t know she was one until the end of the night to me she was a hot as fuck bimbo doll the type of woman i had only seen in porn and had never had luck with previously she asked me who i was there with i said i d finished djing and that me and a group of my girl mates had come to the club i had only just met those girls but i painted the right picture i tried to play it as if i was the prize again that i have value and status because look at the girls around me and that if she wins me she will be able to take me away from those girls hot girls love to fuck up other girls nights anyway i successfully let that play out we hung out for an hour before i made my move girls like that trust no man as they only ever attract fuck boys who fuck them over to get anywhere i knew i would have to validate myself as a potential partner but i also knew i had to validate myself as a genuine guy one who is not from the crowd of dickheads that she usually meets to be fair we ended up just making out in the club for another hour and i got her number after she was staying at her friends house and i could tell they had plans for the next day so it wasn t a situation i could force in my favour all good plus she is a stripper she knows the game well she know s most men just want to fuck i tried a different angle by being sexual but also nice hoping that it will either go one of two ways one we hooked up and that was fun two when i message her she messages me back even though she is sober and i meet up with her again and on a night where i can take her back to mine i ll absolutely need to play my cards right to make sure i can fuck her regularly so this one is in limbo right now for me it s been a great two weeks for someone who was shy and insecure who lacked social skills as his life to being in a relationship for years and sticking with the one partner and feeling the whole time that nobody wants me to coming out of it realising my worth realising that confidence is everything to realising that a lot of women are actually trash and that i am the prize to no longer putting women on a pedestal to reading a few tips on here and going out and pulling all of that off i feel fucking great two weeks boys i ve had a lot of fun i ll sign off on this note it is a numbers game as there were many times in between where i experienced the white noise feeling but if you hold out and keep pushing along your chances of finding someone is still until you decide to go home alone my next step is to master the follow up so that it isn t just a once off thing on the night but that i can have these women on call for dates sex and banter if you have any advice on this then please drop it in the comments thank you reddit for making me realise my worth i hope i provided some good advice from the field good luck boys
14845,disclaimer i am diagnosed with moderate adhd c but don t take medication for it this post is intended for those here in theredpill that have been diagnosed with adhd or strongly believe they have it i wrote it in a manner that the majority of people can understand it read it on the toilet enjoy theredpill is the perfect way of life for someone with adhd plating women lifting weights and thinking independently is what we naturally do best mr badass how to theredpill with adhd intro adhd basics intense exercise mental stimulation rejection sensitive dysphoria attention whore addiction hyper sexuality and under sexuality adhd and approaching women plates and relationships friendships adhd and dark triad how to hyperfocus workplaces social media greyscale mode airplane mode innovator of independence intro adhd attention deficient hyperactivity disorder is one of those things that tends to be misunderstood by the general public and is usually seen as either a blessing or a curse by those that have it in this post i will talk about strategies for those who have adhd to understand and use theredpill principles most effectively people with adhd have an out the box brain and need some guidance on how to understand some foundations of theredpill like lifting getting stuff done making money and plating women just because you have adhd doesn t give you an excuse to not excel at life adhd is not a get out of jail free card to be lazy and jerk off all day you can manage it and even use its advantages to make some serious money get fit and plate women when people hear the word adhd they usually have four different perspectives about it psychological term some people think that adhd means that you can t concentrate are hyperactive or can t focus for more than twenty seconds to concentrate you must enter hyperfocus which means to have laser guided concertation for hours on one specific task and ignore the world adderall helps turn hyperfocus on and off easily lazy other people believe that adhd is a made up disorder for lazy unmotivated people that need a good ass kicking adhd people simply need to stop living in the clouds and come down to earth so they face stone cold reality they have the belief that adhd people simply need to learn discipline and master their willpower made up by drug companies a minority of people believe that adhd is mass brainwashing by the pharmaceutical companies to sell adderall to parents so little timmy can be obedient in school these drug companies championed the idea of adhd in the s to earn extra profits and adhd is made up extraordinary gift finally others claim that albert einstein and steve jobs would have been diagnosed with adhd if they were born in this millennium they argue that adhd is excellent for outside the box and non linear technical skills like computer science software engineering high mathematics and programming they argue that adhd is a gift for those that have careers were they need to concentrate on something for hours or need to do outside the box thinking adhd basics the best way is can describe adhd is that their brain is a ferrari with really weak brakes you can drive down a straight highway at miles and hours but have trouble slowing down efficiency when racing around corners medication like adderall allows those with adhd to have the strong brakes to slow down to do detailed oriented tasks like reading on the neurobiological level adhd is an imbalance of the brain chemical dopamine feel good chemical and having weak executive functions skills like starting tasks not getting distracted and staying organized amp nbsp adhd classification adhd has three major categories inattentive type gt not paying attention to detail gt making careless mistakes gt failing to pay attention and keep on task gt not listening gt being unable to follow or understand instructions gt avoiding tasks that involve effort gt being distracted gt being forgetful gt losing things that are needed to complete tasks hyperactive impulsive gt fidgeting gt squirming gt getting up often when seated gt running or climbing at inappropriate times gt having trouble playing quietly gt talking too much gt talking out of turn or blurting out gt interrupting gt often on the go as if driven by a motor combined gt this is the most common type of adhd people with it have symptoms of both inattentive and hyperactive impulsive types majority of people with the inattentive type tend to be diagnosed in their s and s while those with the hyperactive impulsive type tend to be diagnosed as kids majority of people assume adhd only applies to kids and they row out of it when they grow up the reality is of kids that have adhd still have it as adults a adhd disadvantages according to the book smart but scattered most people with adhd have trouble with the following executive functions amp nbsp task initiation ability to begin projects without procrastination working memory ability to hold information while doing complex tasks sustained attention ability to keep attention while distracted bored or tired organization ability to create systems that keep things in order meta cognition ability to see your life in a bird s eye view and ask how i m doing other disadvantages include that we tend to be novelty seekers who have trouble staying with the same women want to do everything or nothing at once and energy drinks and pre workout calms us down instead of giving us physical energy b adhd advantages according to the book the adhd advantage most people with adhd have the following advantages resilience we see the light at the end of the darkest tunnel never give up hyper focus we can have concentration for hours on things that interest us creativity we make connections between things that tend to not have connections risk taking we love a challenge and excel in emergency situations it fires us up charisma outside the box thinking makes it easy to tell great stories multitasking excellent at doing many things at once other advantages include being interested in multiple hobbies at the same time being quick on our feet in emergency situations and being the life of the party most people with adhd have extra physical energy levels and can exercise for longer than the average person this is excellent for dancers and runners who need extra endurance and stamina adhd and intense exercise the best way to manage adhd is to increase your dopamine levels and try to keep them high every day if you have adhd you must exercise every day every day no ifs what s or i m too tired you must do something that raises your heart rate or engages your fight or flight responses exercise is necessary to keep your dopamine levels in a stable range i recommend hiit running or strength training best exercises to engage your fight or flight response are squats deadlifts and bench presses personally my biggest dopamine boosts are dancing for an hour with the hoes in zumba class for most of you doing hiit training before your weightlifting for minutes should be sufficient realize that for most people with adhd preworkout and energy drinks give them a calm meditative focus instead of extra physical energy you can access your emergency dopamine by masturbating and then taking a cold shower make sure to hit the gym in the next hour before it wears off adhd and mental stimulation on theredpill i wrote two posts called you need mental stimulation to be alpha and pt mental stimulation and you that describe mental stimulation in great detail the tl dr of those posts is that men need hobbies to be satisfied if you have adhd you must i repeat must have a mentally stimulating hobby to keep you from being bored and depressed your brain is like a ferrari that needs to race down the track at miles per hour once in a while your hobby can be anything that proves a mental challenge it can be anything from fixing cars doing math shooting guns programming or flirting with women your hobby or hobbies must be something that highly interests you and keeps you away from spectator activities like watching television or sports spectator activities are not for you mr adhd because they don t reward you with enough dopamine i m sorry bro but your brain is wired differently and needs jolts of neurobiological electrical stimulation in the form of doing a hobby of interest people with adhd that are not mentally stimulated tend to get distracted on stop that doesn t matter like social media or focusing on an oneitis rejection sensitive dysphoria it is extremely common for people with adhd to have rejection sensitive dysphoria which makes them extreme people pleasers rejection sensitive dysphoria rsd is an extreme emotional sensitivity and emotional pain triggered by the perception not necessarily the reality that a person has been rejected teased or criticized by important people in their life rsd can make people with adhd anticipate rejection even when it is anything but certain this can make them vigilant about avoiding it which can be misdiagnosed as social phobia social phobia is an intense anticipatory fear that you will embarrass or humiliate yourself in public or that you will be scrutinized harshly by the outside world a rejection sensitive dysphoria and oneitis the best defense against oneitis for an adhd individual is daily intensive exercise and mental stimulation to keep your dopamine up if you have adhd it is extremely easy to get oneitis and the oneitis tends to be many times stronger than the average person the reason is that rsd tends to amplify and multiply the amount of dopamine generated when an adhd person has oneitis people with adhd tend to scan every person they meet to figure out what that person admires and praises then they hyperfocus on that specific person which generates massive amounts of dopamine because their brain is working at speed like a hamster wheel which feels good the more they analyze that person the more dopamine they receive if you have adhd you must use metacognition and meditate to analyze if you are unconsciously hyper focusing on a particular person you must recognize when you are starting to get oneitis to cut that person off if you already have oneitis i highly recommend you do intense exercise and take an energy drink to calm your mind down if the oneitis is strong your last resort is to talk to many women to plant many seeds that generate dopamine instead of one source b rejection sensitive dysphoria and approach anxiety for most adhd people if they try something new and fail or fall short in front of anyone else it s just too painful and too risky to even consider for these people approach anxiety and social anxiety is very common in dealing with beautiful women the reason is that the sudden dopamine boost from the rsd short circuits their brain and they experience task inhibition which causes massive procrastination a metaphor is if you re a passenger in a sports car and the driver suddenly revs up to miles per hour for no reason and you don t know what to do they get overwhelmed with the different ways they can talk to her for adhd people they don t know where to even begin because they become extremely overwhelmed by overanalyzing the situation the best way for an adhd individual to deal with rsd is to immediately approach the girl and just say hi asap all they have to do is go up to the girl and say hello that s it the more exposure adhd individuals have to beautiful women the less of a dopamine boost they will experience when approaching attention whore addiction for most adhd people interacting with attention whores is like snorting cocaine addicting a similar effect also happens when adhd men deal with women with bipolar disorder the reason is that most attention whores and bipolar women have excellent skills in getting our attention not giving it up which causes a challenge which creates mental stimulation they know how to activate our emotional regulation centers in the brain which for most adhd people are unstable due to dopamine imbalances the way it works is simple the attention whore gets the attention of the adhd person then the attention whore either plays hard to get or teases him for the adhd person this causes them to start to overanalyze the situation to create a plan to fuck the attention whore the over analyzation creates a dopamine boost because the adhd brain gets to work at hamster wheel speed which makes them feel good the more the attention whore makes the adhd person feel like they re closer to solving the challenge fucking her the more of a dopamine rush he gets a metaphor is like buying a lottery ticket where you get numbers correct every time and feel like you re really close to winning the lottery the more you try the best way to defend again attention whores is to identify their behavior daily intensive exercise and talking to multiple women also helps regulate your dopamine levels so the attention whole doesn t get your hyperfocus hyper sexuality and under sexuality people with adhd seek novelty and stimulation if you have adhd you need to identify if you are hypersexual or the undersexual subtype the undersexual subtype can go years without the need for sex because they can hyperfocus on their career or hobbies the hypersexual subtype makes excellent seducers but gets distracted by pussy super easily both subtypes are determined by the levels of dopamine of noradrenalin feel good chemicals in an adhd brain medications that treat adhd mobilize primarily dopamine and noradrenalin a hypersexual adhd subtype for the hypersexual adhd person sex gives them a dopamine boost because fucking a new woman is like solving a challenging puzzle that gives them a super high the hypersexual subtype is like a ying yang twins stereotype that has women on their minds all the time they literally have ass and titties on their mind and are extremely horrible at long term relationships they re great at plating women and as teenagers tend to have masturbated a lot in my personal opinion i suspect a majority of people in the nofap community have undiagnosed adhd with the hypersexual subtype if you re the hypersexual subtype you must find ways to earn your dopamine from many resources like intense exercise or working on an interesting hobby rather than just pussy if you feel like you are too sexual on dates drink some coffee or an energy drink to lower your libido the energy drink coffee should put you in a mellow and chill mood b undersexual adhd subtype if you are the undersexual type you must learn how to generate dopamine from women you probably avoid women due to your rejection sensitive dysphoria the good news is that the more women you talk to the more of a high you will receive this means you must learn to get into situations that increase sexual tension like eye contact you re the type that needs to leave video games behind on saturday night and go to the nightclub more approaching women in public should be a standard activity for you lifting heavy ass weights needs to be your daily activity to get that fight or flight response the more sexual tension you are exposed to the more balanced your sexuality will be increased and balanced i highly recommend you listen to sexualized rap music by lil jon ying yang twins too short lil scrappy and young buck start with the song whistle while you twerk by ying yang twins let the youtube auto play songs for you i also recommend you do some sort of dance activity whether it s a zumba class or go to the nightclub being around beautiful women adhd and approaching women for both the hypersexual and undersexual subtypes of adhd approaching women has the same general steps as soon as you see the girl you must go up and say hello don t let your mind do hamster wheels and get distracted by dozens of reasons why you shouldn t approach don t go into la la land or let yourself daydream of the future together all you have to do is go up to the girl and say hello then use your adhd brain to talk about something she is wearing or something around you i would highly recommend you get yourself in an amused and relaxed state of mind by managing your dopamine levels jerk off before leaving the house or drink an energy drink in social situations avoid weed at all costs unless you want to be a zombie that s it undersexual subtypes should listen to sexualized rap music like ying yang twins to get in the mood if you re the hypersexual subtype please for the love of the gods please behave at the workplace don t shit where you eat if you re getting oneitis you better be doing daily intense exercise to balance your dopamine plates and relationships people with adhd are excellent at having plates but usually horrible a having long term relationships having a hypergamous benefits people with adhd because we love novelty and new situations plating multiple women is your natural gift theredpill way of thinking is perfect for people with adhd the reason is adhd people crave novelty and stimulation and most sexual relationships will become boring after a few months trust me unless you are on adderall you will get bored of that dream girl you want to be your girlfriend an example is that you re plating abby and betty you will easily get bored of abby for days and then focus on betty when you get bored of betty then you can focus on abby again if you can manage your rejection sensitive dysphoria you can become the perfect seducer it s very hard for an adhd person to be committed to one girl because his mind wants new experiences all the time a ocd girls are our natural enemy women with ocd obsessive compulsive disorder are our natural enemies because they love to nag ocd women will drive you insane with all their rules and need to have things in perfect order nagging is extremely irritating to an adhd brain because it triggers a fight or flight response easily due to our emotional dysregulation these women think its okay to behave as if they re our mother and they become extra frustrated when you forget the little things the first sign is that they get mad when you don t text back right away women with ocd tend to be accountants administrative assistants and work in law avoid avoid avoid b single mothers and daddy issues are cocaine oh my lord single mothers girls with daddy issues just avoid if you get oneitis and hyperfocus on them prepare to give up your soul if they trigger the hyperfocus of an adhd he will make it his life mission to provide for her the rejection sensitive dysphoria of adhd can make men into the ultimate people pleasers if triggered single mothers and daddy issue girls are excellent at asking for help the more an adhd person helps them the more of a long term dopamine boost they receive due to the sunk cost fallacy the hyperfocus makes the adhd person analyze and think of ways of how to help the single mother or miss daddy issues the more he analyzes the more of a dopamine boost he receives until he is hooked for single mothers it s helping the kid with his homework which leads to babysitting the kid which leads to being his new daddy for daddy issues girls it s helping her pay her phone bill then buying her an iphone then buying her a macbook if you have adhd be hyper conscious about helping women they can easily steal your soul the more you help them you will feel good but she will have your soul plating multiple women and doing daily intensive exercise provides defense against getting hooked do your best to avoid c bipolars the ultimate attraction nothing attracts an adhd mind stronger than a girl with bipolar disorder if single mothers and daddy issues are like cocaine bipolar women are like synthetic heroin that makes you want to gamble your organs away for a gram they have both your soul and you re existing just run away the roller coaster of good feelings and bad feelings is like orgasms for the adhd brain rejection sensitive dysphoria of adhd creates one of the most intense people pleasing phenomenon when dealing with bipolar women the reason is that adhd brain will work at to find ways to please her which causes the hamster wheel to spin and generate massive dopamine boosts she yells at you beats you up emotionally cucks you with many men but you still come home to say yes dear if you have adhd please please please avoid bipolar women friendships if you have adhd majority of your friends will probably have adhd or have some sort of rebellion to being normal or following the rules of society the best friendships for you are people that love going to the gym or are some sort of innovator an innovator is someone who introduces new methods ideas or ways of seeing the world your perfect friendships are entrepreneurs seducers and artists because they tend to love outside the box thinkers friendships to avoid are close minded rigid people who are highly religious hate risks socially shy or extremely blue pilled these types will tell you to chill the worst friendships are narcissistic a type individuals because you will clash hard a types think they re the smartest people in the room and hate new ideas these types are usually in sales or finance and highly materialistic a homegirl friendships are beneficial for those that have adhd having platonic female friends homegirls is very beneficial the reason is that you have a multi tasking hypergamous mind and get bored easily in sexual relationships having homegirls provides safe relationships that will always be there trust me when you replace plates every three months having stable homegirls that know your history and have strong bonds with will keep you from crashing hard from rejections they are excellent for preselection and you can triple text them without worry they are great at analyzing if you re getting too attracted to a girl and can provide structure to bring you to reality great homegirls are those that have a cold view of reality and highly practical motherly types excellent at reminding you to not be a people pleaser or leave that girl alone adhd and dark triad adhd types tend to be masters of machiavellianism because they can lie easily think outside the box and have silver tongues machiavellianism is characterized by manipulation and exploitation of others a cynical disregard for morality and a focus on self interest and deception people with adhd tend to scan every person they meet to figure out what that person admires and praises and most children with adhd learn to become naturally machiavellian a common trait for adhd teens is that they re frequent liars google adhd lying the reason is that it s really fun for adhd to tell great embellishing stories and see how far they can go before they get called out embellishing stories allow us to analyze and brainstorm on the fly which is very enjoyable because it s mentally stimulating a way for an adhd person to practice machiavellianism is to learn improvisation and standup comedy our hyperfocus multitasking ability and hyper focus allows us to brainstorm stories extremely quick if an adhd can hyperfocus on themselves and their goals they can think of ways on how to reach goals faster by using other people how to hyperfocus the greatest ability for an adhd is the ability to hyperfocus which means to concentrate at while ignoring everything around you the more dopamine you generate the longer your hyperfocus the following strategies can be used to learn how to get into hyperfocus easier pomodoro technique use a pomodoro app to concentrate for minutes intensely then take a min break intensive exercise go to the gym before you study you should have hours of calm focus after brain dump write type everything you can think of for the next minutes social fire go approach hot women or get in touch with your plates before you study do something social emergency mode pretend your project is due asap try to get things done as fast as possible sprint psytrance music listen to full on psytrance music the faster the better delayed masturbation when you re about to cum stop wait thirty seconds repeat several times meditation sometimes intense meditation can lead to a hyper focused state racing video games play a racing video game for minutes i recommend the wipeout hd series ying yang time get fired up by listening to aggressive and sexualized rap like lil john or ying yang twins bedroom dance dance in your bedroom to the most emotional blue pilled romantic songs like london boys caffeine once every four days you can have an energy drink or three cups of coffee only if you don t have meds start a fight get in a situation where someone gets really mad online at you and gets you fired up f the haters workplaces i highly recommend you don t tell your boss or hr that you have adhd because they will find a way to let you go there is a misconception that people with adhd make more mistakes and cannot focus there is also a stigma associated with taking adderall in the united states a person with adhd who needs accommodations is protected by the ada american with disabilities act but hr will find a way to build a case around you and let you go the best workplaces are those with minimal micromanagement where you can organize how you get your work done the technology industry especially it and outsides sales where you travel are excellent for adhd people also if you have the hypersexual subtype of adhd avoid the women at work don t chat with the receptionist don t eat with your female coworker for lunch don t cheat where you eat avoid social media greyscale mode airplane mode if you have adhd i would tell you to avoid social media so you don t get distracted the reality is that unless you re in monk mode i m in a happy five months monk mode you re going to use social media what i highly recommend is that you use greyscale mode on your phone when browsing instagram and snapchat so you get a reduced dopamine bump since it s in black and white seeing your plate s nudes on snapchat will suck but you won t get easily distracted i also recommend you put yourself in self mandated airplane mode this means that you try to get your work done first before you go on social media save social media for the evening and tell the hoes you get busy in the day if they complain if you re addicted to social media develop a regiment of daily exercise to balance your dopamine levels if you re still addicted then masturbate before you go on social media trust me it s not going to be as enjoyable innovator of independence if you have adhd you must guard your independence since everything wants your attention to distract you your energy source is dopamine which might be guarded like gold you must also understand that your adhd brain gives you the natural gift on innovation innovation is to think outside the box and form connections between things that rarely exist together you must cultivate a sense of curiosity and wonderment for how you see the world you need to find activities that allow you to naturally hyperfocus realize that your brain of non linear thinking is rare and that having your head in the clouds can be balanced by keeping a list of stuff you have to do most people will not understand how you see the world and you will probably spend a lot of time being independent many people will tell you that you re really smart creative or have lots of energy this many flatter you but realize the most innovative people with adhd are always learning your mind must always be mentally stimulated many people with adhd tend to take online courses at edx or coursera most people with adhd have multiple artistic technical and physical hobbies you must always see yourself as an innovator and use your ideas and new ways of thinking to improve your own world
14863,tl dr go to lessons and summary part personally i feel field reports when used correctly can be some of the greatest learning mechanisms on this sub the majority of the content on here is simply theory field reports are the practical test of this theory the sidebar the posts they re all meaningless if they don t get tested out in the real world this is where the true lessons are internalized for me reflecting on my many years on this sub nothing formed a better real life example than the comparison between my pre trp ltr and my post trp ltr the behaviors i employed in the first relationship and the behaviors i employed in my last one and their corresponding results for me it was astounding to see the effect it had not only on my life but my partners too and the joy we derived from the relationship for me trp was never about getting girls as i was doing fine in that department i was naturally athletic and always lifted for me it was about managing my woman i was naturally good with woman and there s the illusion that because someone gets a lot of woman they know how to manage them i can tell you that is false in every sense of the word i could never understand how despite my best efforts the results were constantly more uphill i couldn t understand why doing what they asked of me was yielding little to no results even as someone who got girls blue pill programming encapsulates my pre trp relationship and the results it had my pre trp ltr was kayla i somewhat wanted an ltr like it s a goddamn nice pair of shoes and was sleeping around quite a lot but felt none of them were quite the full package enough to ltr i held the notion that there s a perfect girl out there for you and that it would just click once i met her i met kayla at a party typical girl who liked to party although that seemed normal she was an absolute stunner petite body perky ass beautiful face she was a model and worked as a promo girl she had a great sense of humor and was fairly smart too she also came from a single mother household but more on that later at the time her partying habits and promo girl work seemed completely normal to me and to be honest i think her beauty clouded a lot of my judgement i thought that she was that perfect girl out there but in reality it was simply attraction masquerading as soulmate she was sitting perky on a pedestal from day one we spent quite a bit of time together over the coming weeks i had a good time with her and i was always good at conversation and making her laugh she knew how hot she was though and knew how to make me work for her obviously i wanted to sleep with her but she was having none of it first date which i paid for i got nothing not even a kiss second date still me paying nothing after weeks and me starting to show slight disinterest at the the constant rejection i finally got a kiss i was clearly happy about it throughout our dates this woman would have men feigning after her constantly messaging her phone big instagram following guys looking at her when we were out constantly bumping into one of her orbiters when we were out she had no problem openly displaying all the affection she was receiving from other guys she wanted me to know on the one hand this obviously made me pretty chuffed with myself being the one with her on my arm but on the other hand it made me think i ve gotta treat her better and woo her better than all these other guys could i worked harder to show her how special she was i was excessively romantic took her to nice places did amazing things for her i was getting kisses at this point but i wasn t getting a whiff of her pussy she kept on telling me she needs to be serious with a guy before she sleeps with him despite having fucked a lot more guys than she s had boyfriends with that knowledge in mind and with all the attention she was getting elsewhere i thought i need to lock her down after about weeks of dating i asked her out she said she s not sure yet and would think about it but let s keep doing what we re doing i was like the needy plate wanting security over time we carried on me trying my utmost to please her bare in mind i was a guy getting a decent amount of pussy before this but i had convinced myself she was the one i cut out all the other woman i was talking to and focused solely on her because that s what gentlemen do right finally she said okay we can do a trial period i thought this was great i was dating a stunner guys were jealous of me woman ogled me with her on my arm there was just one problem i still hadn t fucked her i tried and tried and slowly i went through the bases like a toddler and after months of knowing her i finally fucked her and sweet jesus did i fuck the shit out of her i was experienced enough and gave her a great time but what a journey to get there we decided everything together in the relationship because you know we re a team right sadly most of the time it was her bitching about things i wanted to do and me compromising on things she wanted to do i thought it was best to just keep the peace seeing my friends and family was always a drag for her but i made all the effort in the world to acquaint myself with her family and friends without question the theme of me having to work for everything continued throughout the relationship most people thought i must be happy because i m dating a model but despite constantly convincing myself i was i was anything but she would constantly tell me she s not sure about us and just needs to see more from to know that she s sure dedicated me thought ok let me do what she s saying she wants i would write letters give her cute gifts i would constantly be available for her constantly showed her how much she meant to me throughout this period she would still go out to work and do promos in clubs with men flirting and drooling after her all night she would also chat with guys while out at work and although she never flirted directly with guys in front of me she would also never make a point of batting them away she was just talking when she bumped into orbiters she d chat at length to them in short she was an attention whore wherever it came from her instagram when we were out the fact that she mostly had guy friends because girls are so bitchy i would get jealous all the time and openly show it she would deny any wrong doing and make it seem like i was being controlling all the while if i ever went out alone or spoke to other girls it would be a major issue so being the good little blue smurf i was i would avoid going out without her i would avoid talking to other girls i would make a point of not making her jealous because it clearly upset her and i wanted her to be happy this was a one way street however she was constantly moody like the grinch moody always had some issue or another and would take it out on me arguments became more and more regular and every time we would argue it always had to be me to back down and apologize i didn t want to lose her i would make it up to her with some soppy apology or do something nice to make things right again i started to spend less time with friends and even family because it would be an issue if i did almost anything without her i started to focus less on my job to pour more time and attention to my relationship but it was to no avail i couldn t understand why the more i was trying to make her happy the more upset she was i had always heard that communication was key in a relationship i tried to tell her how i felt i would tell her about all the trials and hardships i was going through it baffled me as to why things weren t coming right when we were talking and being open and honest with each other my friends and family could see it and tried to speak to me but i denied everything told them they didn t know her like i do in fact this distanced me even further from them i was spending way too much money on her my lifting had taken a back seat the sex was becoming less and less then one day i was deleting old pics off an old phone and saw one from right before i met her it was at a party i was smiling ripped to the core and had a hottie on my arm that i banged later that night i looked in the mirror that day and saw how much weight i d loss the bags under my eyes hair scruffy and unkempt and thought what the fuck has happened to me i used to do what i wanted bang who i wanted see who i wanted woman used to love me but here i was sacrificing everything giving everything of myself to please this one woman overnight i checked out of the relationship i simply stopped caring stopped caring how she felt and started caring how i felt in fact i resented her i started going out with my friends again stopped communicating with her started doing what i wanted when i wanted didn t care if she got jealous i didn t care if the relationship ended i basically started living life for myself we had been together for about years at this point the change in her was almost immediate suddenly her moods disappeared she was so much happier and positive all the time she suddenly started working less to no promo shifts all on her own she started making cute little things for me she went out of her way to make sure i didn t get jealous she shut down guys when they approached her told me regularly how much i meant to her she suddenly wanted to have sex all the time she was becoming the woman i thought she would be when i was doing everything in my power to please her i tried to get back into it but i was dead at this point i held far too much resentment why now why now that i m out is she suddenly in why didn t she care when i was trying so damn hard eventually we sat down one day and i told her it was over she sobbed and cried and said she was so sorry that she knew she was difficult and didn t appreciate me she said she would change she said she would be different but it was too late for me i had made up my mind i walked out and never looked back she continued to contact me trying to reconcile it was hard at first but i never replied i knew it had to be a clean break i knew that i had to focus on myself for a bit rebuild myself the relationship was so draining and i had no sense of who i was anymore one day i was chatting to a friend about it telling him that i just couldn t figure out how the harder i tried the worse she became and the less i tried the better she became he directed me here and the rest is history lessons vetting is imperative i did zero vetting fuckall had i taken my eyes off her ass long enough to see her many shortfalls i would have saved myself tons of uphill there is no soulmate destiny only compatability going into any relationship with that notion is a cancer it s good as long as it s good and if it s not no matter how much you think it s your soulmate it s time to walk a woman will not reward you in proportion to your efforts in fact the opposite was true for kayla the more i gave the more she took the less i gave the more invested she became i made her happiness my priority and the nett result was that we were both miserable her moody and me baffled as to why she wasn t satisfied with it in reality all i was doing was showing that i was a low value man that would put up with whatever shit she threw at me i gave her comfort and that gave her license to behave how she wanted and how she wanted was to extract as much from me as possible woman have no idea what they want despite my best efforts to do everything she said she wanted it never satisfied her she was her most happy and devoid of moods when i checked out of the relationship the prospect of losing me suddenly dawned on her and she finally started treating me the way i had always hoped for her to a woman will only respect you if she knows you can leave her abundance abundance abundance i cut out all woman to make kayla worry less what i was doing was engineering the demise of my own relationship she didn t appreciate me for this she only saw it as more reason to behave how she wanted without consequence because i removed every consequence out of my life set boundaries there were many times i should have walked but every time i didn t she pushed those boundaries a little further the next time partying talking to other guys in front of me i should never have tolerated that shit but i did so she kept doing it when you give her comfort hypergamy runs rife this is why she would go out all the time talk to other guys she was constantly gauging her market value seeing what other options were available to her i think the only reason she didn t branch swing was because i still held some value in the form of looks social status career sex and commitment i handed over commitment on a silver platter she never had to prove herself worthy all the while i hadn t even fucked her yet which she kept dangling in front of me like a banana to a chimp she never had to work for my affections that came free of charge while i was a circus clown trying to bang her it was only when my interest would waver that she d finally give it up a woman can not respect a man who isn t a strong leader i thought making decisions together was a great relationship move i didn t set boundaries i blame myself for the problems in the relationship i didn t lead and without me leading she was left having to lead herself and the direction she lead herself in was neither pleasant for me or her your willingness to leave is what keeps her invested she will not honor your undying loyalty your devotion is worthless to her it simply devalues you in her eyes a strong alpha who s biology is to spread his seed but sits like a loyal little puppy for one special little woman can t be all that high value after all simply can t negotiate attraction as much as i would express my issues and spend hours upon hours arguing my logic fell on deaf ears a woman will behave based on her feelings if you want her to change make the way she feels change logic or reason will simply not yield results maintaining yourself in a relationship i began to let myself slip and all this did was lower my market value which lowered my value in her eyes this only makes her more comfortable and hypergamous part it s been a good few years now i spun plates for many years and enjoyed myself i was living for me and it made me happy i had no stress and no worries i built up my business got seriously back into lifting solid group of friends overall i was in a good space i had finally gotten to a point where one of my relationships had progressed to the point of emotional investment although this time it was different so very very different at this point i was a different man held different beliefs about woman and their interactions with men but most of all i had different expectations from them i was plating two woman at the time and would still get something fresh here and there in between i met sarah at a mall she was walking towards me and i was looking directly at her beautiful face small petite body perky ass again she had a very natural beauty about her with deep sparkly eyes i ve never been one for social anxiety and went up to her and spoke to her chatted for a bit got her number walked away sarah is beautiful she s an ex model quit because she despised the industry in my opinion better looking than kayla some of my friends agree one or two think kayla was hotter matter of taste i guess overall it s a pretty good comparison of two woman of equal social standing messaged her a couple days later and set up a date went for casual drinks nothing fancy the conversation flowed we both had a great time we went out to a casual drinks spot on the beach we went for a walk on the beach afterwards and i went for the pull in she was very much into it and i could tell the close was on the cards i lived a short walk away and invited her to come and see the view from my place she was keen we walked back had glass of wine and fucked like rabbits over the next few weeks we saw each other about twice a week sometimes only once depending on other plates it was mostly casual her coming over to me and if we did something it would be very casual the sex was good i was happy and enjoying myself and so was she throughout this time i continued seeing my other plates and even gaming new girls after about two months or so we started spending a bit more time together i had a lot more fun with her personality wise than my other girls she was fun easy going chilled smart i would want to do something or go somewhere and i d find myself taking her along she loved the fact that i was showing a little more investment in her slowly but surely i started seeing the other girls less but not completely i didn t explicitly tell her i was seeing other girls but i didn t exactly hide it either sometimes one of them would leave something at my place and the other would find it but i didn t care i wasn t exclusive i was also chatty to other girls in front of her i didn t tell her what i did during the time i wasn t with her in fact most of my life besides some fun here and there and my bedroom she knew very little about me what she did know was that if she left at any point that i had other options it wasn t long before the dreaded where is this going talk came up she was used to guys chasing her hard but said with me she had no idea where she stood i brushed it off mostly saying i m having fun right now and so are you right so lets just keep enjoying ourselves and it goes where it goes we started doing more and more together but never at the expense of my work or family and friends when i had work the next day it was in bed by when i wanted to see my friends i did but when i was with her i was with her i would take her on weekend always to my holiday place we would go out a little more for dinners or to the beach with me cutting down my visits from my other plates i felt myself investing a little more emotionally in her this was something she was never to know as per our discussion i kept taking it day by day simply enjoying the process after about months i had cut out seeing other girls it was just sarah now things we re good she was an animal in bed and wanted to fuck all the time in fact i had trouble keeping up with her we would bang every time i saw her which was about times a week at this point we would do alot of fun things together and i think she picked up on the little more investment she was getting she seemed genuinely over the moon about it despite the talk coming up again i never gave her anymore security she still didn t know how i spent my time apart from her and i would stilll keep contact with other girls we d go out and i d bump into other girls i knew i d chat and be friendly as i am i could see the jealousy all over her face every time i did i was happy she treated me like a king always doing cute things for me massages dinners blowjobs in the car i d go over to her place and she d be naked in kitchen waiting for me things were good one day she even blurted out i love you i simply smiled back and said i know despite my overwhelming feeling to say it back i was the leader and she supported me well she was an angel percent of the time she never went out and partied and if she did she d make sure i came along she d bat away any attention she got from other guys in all the time we were together i think there was only one thing she did that i didn t agree with i cut down contact for a day she apologized a day later and it s never happened again i never told her she can t see other people never told her to bat away other guys never told her she had to do anything for me she did it all on her own she did alot for me and trust me i appreciated it but it wasn t all one way i d do buy nice stuff for her sometimes as well mostly when she was being cute or sweet and i thought she really deserved it i would take her on amazing adventures we d do crazy things together we d be wild and naughty we d get drunk together get high together i would help her with her career i d give her advice her life was heading in a much better direction as a result of our time together her closest childhood friend even told me one day that she never seen sarah happier a couple more months went by and upon the next talk i told her we can give it a go and see how it goes but we ll take it day by day it s been over a year and half since we met now and nothing has changed the sex is still wild as ever we still have a ton of fun she is still the same sweetheart i met who cooks naked massages me and comes home with a cute surprise for me to this day i still lift hard as ever my work is still a top priority and she loves spending time with my friends and family lessons approach and have confidence throughout relationship from the moment i approached her to now i did everything with confidence if your confidence frame is unbroken by her beauty shit tests she ll perceive you to be high value she s not special don t treat her as such there s a million more like her i never did all the mushy nice things i did for kayla to sarah kayla sat on an undeserved pedestal and gave me no reward for my efforts she needs to work for your attention the nicer sarah was doing nice things the more attention she got and deservedly so the worse she behaved or had unnecessary moods the less attention she got which was next to never a woman will work for your attention when it s given sporadically maintaining other options i never cut ties with other woman she knew this i spoke to other woman not flirt in front of her your ability to get other woman is directly correlated to how well she treats you if she knows theres an abundance of other women willing to step in if she treats you like shit she will cease to do so commitment is earned not given she continuously worked to prove she was a good option for a relationship and continues to do so a woman will not reward you for committing to her she will reward you in an effort to gain your commitment lead in decisions i ll tell her we re doing something fun this weekend or that we re going to a cool place for dinner she appreciates and takes comfort that she doesn t have to worry about these things as much as society says it s a team effort there can only be one captain steering the ship and it better be you a woman can relax and be happy knowing that she has a strong capable leader who has her best interests at heart comfort kills attraction this deserves it s own post kayla was as comfy as can be sarah knows her spot is not guaranteed the more comfortable she is the less effort she puts in and why would she knowing that you can leave if she treats you like shit or that you can replace her is what keeps her invested keep up your own life with kayla i slacked on lifting family and friends she saw that as all the more reason to put less effort in sarah knows my life will still be great without her maintain your market value career friendship networks lifting a man on a mission who has his own kick ass life and goals is what makes her want to be apart of that journey if you can t look after and respect yourself neither will she treat her when it s earned i bought kayla nice things and did cute little things to make her feel better or happy and she instinctively picked up that shit moodiness tantrums yielded investment from me sarah gets rewarded positively and she behaves positively to earn it summary ultimately there is always game going on whether you decide to play it or not is up to you she is constantly measuring your performance not with a scorecard or checklist but subconsciously she is measuring the way you behave towards her and determining your value based on that how she values you is significantly important it s the determining factor of how she treats you i played towards all the markers of a low value man in my first ltr and i got treated as such i take responsibility for that in my most recent ltr i m playing towards the markers of a high value man and i m getting treated as such and she is happier for it too often when i mention this people will say i don t want to constantly be playing a game but in all honestly when you ve done it long enough it almost becomes second nature you re conscious of it but the way you react to things is almost automated more importantly she s playing the game as the selector she s measuring her selection all the time and when you ve been deemed to be a good one she will treat you as such she will be happy sweet sexual supportive a moody sexless relationship is a sign of a woman who s not entirely happy with her selection i m thankful for both relationships one for the growth it drove me to have and the other for the happiness i derive from it most of all i take comfort knowing that the success of it lies entirely in my hands
14943,ha you thought this would be a post filled with philosophical musings din t you don t worry i won t bore you with my metaphysical insights i ain t no philosopher king yet instead this post will actually just be about meditation meditation is a very tricky topic and can be incredibly confusing for those who don t understand it or who are just starting out you may have read a thousand different articles and posts claiming to explain meditation and still not get it everyone has their own different way of describing it and they can be very contradictory and confusing when i began to meditate i honestly didn t know what the fuck i was doing and had a hard time for a while eventually i stumbled on how to do it properly and i think i have the technique down so would like to explain how i do it in ways that really would have helped me had i read them as a noob but first why meditate every culture in history has had some form of meditation encouraged as a practice it is a central part of buddhism and hinduism christians meditate in the morning and before bed also sometimes before meals muslims meditate five times a day why why is it that this practice has been evolutionarily conserved memetically throughout history why are we all encouraged to do it and why has the western world dropped the practice entirely now meditation has a lot of different purposes i would not be able to write out an exhaustive list but the main focuses and goals of meditation are to improve the sense of self to raise mindfulness thoughts vs self an important point to internalise your thoughts are not you now this may be tricky to understand at first but once it clicks it becomes very clear we are not our thoughts a thought that you may have for example i need to study today or leftists are deluded traitors or lifting is good for your health exists as its own entity it is not a part of your consciousness instead it is an entity a meme a concept that is held by your consciousness whenever you think a thing you are bringing the thought into view and focusing on it but that thought is not you that thought is a thought who are you then you are the thing experiencing the thought imagine your mind as a web browser your homepage blank or a search engine a thought would be a website that you open in a new tab each tab you open holds a different thought and you can only focus on one tab at a time you flip between them but your websites are not the browser the browser is the software that displays the websites your consciousness is the software that experiences the thoughts they are not the same thing now i have a really bad habit of never closing tabs and leaving them all open until i have a stream of them at the top of my page i realise now that this is analogous to and stems from my tendency to keep all my thoughts floating about my head and flipping between them endlessly even if they re not important in that moment so what is meditation meditation is the act of closing all the tabs and returning to the home page so that you continue the day browsing session in a cleaner and clearer browser you shut them all off one by one until you are left with the base software just you a good meditator has achieved the ability to just be themselves without thoughts controlling or taking up their mindspace once you are able to just be you your consciousness as a blank slate focusing on nothing entirely well then we can achieve the next step mindfulness mindfulness what is mindfulness mindfulness is described in many different places and literature this is just the name we have for it at the moment it used to be known as being in the moment aurelius called it the directing mind mindfulness is the ability to experience the here and now without any kind of distraction a mode of complete concentration and focus a flow state you will achieve mindfulness sometimes without realising it if you are flowing with something like writing or making music or driving or even just washing the dishes and zoning out what you re doing is letting all your other thoughts die and focusing entirely on the task at hand now this is vitally important because men who can do this and switch it on when required achieve their tasks with ability and effectiveness if you are writing with nothing else taking up your mindspace all of your creative ability and brain processing power can be directed at this task this simply makes you better at it in fact mindfulness is more important in our current era than it ever was people years ago did not have so many distractions and vices and apps and social media competing for their time and attention our attention spans are weak and fragmented we are unable to focus on anything for more than a few seconds ever find yourself unable to watch a minute youtube video without checking the comments below or scrolling through reddit post replies to get the tldr of an article because you can t be bothered to read the full thing well it s because you have no ability to focus on any one thing without having your attention stolen by a more stimulating thought only to get bored of it very quickly too you re scrolling through the porn tabs in your browser trying to find the best one never being satisfied with any of them every video has to be as good or better than your previous best every article needs to be more eye opening and life changing than the ones before we need perfection we need large doses big hits we can t deal with just good enough or a moderate dose a lot of us live our lives on autopilot mode we let our thoughts and common habits dictate our actions and never think much about what we re actually doing we get up and brush our teeth and make breakfast in a kind of zombie mode all while musing and mulling over stupid sit that isn t important at that very moment stressing about future events or re living past ones meditation takes this autopilot mode and switches it off it flips the switch and gives you the wheel and says now drive focus on nothing else this gives you an immense source of power and ability it puts you in the moment and your browser your software is able to experience emotions and tasks at a much deeper and effective level things that never really mattered to you before or you didn t even notice suddenly get amplified and you experience them so much better and joyfully with no other dopamine sinks or distractions you start to downregulate your dose of happiness and find meaning in simpler and smaller things gt gt you leave the house and have nothing to think about nothing occupying your mindspace so you actually notice the sun warming your face and the breeze on your skin shit this actually feels kind of nice a small burst of nostalgia for summer days in the park as a kid it makes you feel slightly better about the day gt gt you re driving your car and you feel this sudden one ness with the vehicle like you re the same entity the way you can manipulate it and swerve and glide with the slightest touch wow this is incredible i have so much power in my control gt gt you re with your plate and you re thinking about nothing else not work no other girls not whether you re going to have sex later or not just being with her suddenly her eyes seem brighter her laugh that you ve heard a thousand times before much more endearing and energising her skin softer the feminine aura around her nurturing and warm she hasn t done anything different hasn t changed you re just experiencing her better loving her more imagine going throughout your whole day like this with simple easy interactions impressing and astounding you that you wouldn t have even bothered with before like a child the whole world takes on a magical wonder and you find happiness and meaning in everything these are known as peak experiences moments in your day that just make you feel on top of the world make you feel so happy for being born and existing make the world feel much less cruel and more welcoming you see those buddhists with enigmatic smiles on their face utterly at peace or those damn hippies rolling around in the grass giggling like children well now we know what they re feeling it would be nice to feel this way too right so how do you do it then how do you become more mindful how do you achieve more peak experiences because up until now i ve told you why people meditate i ve told you what it can achieve and i ve made you aware of the experiences of people who can do it but i haven t actually taught you how here i ll show you this is my method i ve taken the things i ve been taught from literature and reddit posts and the headspace app and developed my own method tweaked from experience the method gt firstly you have to do it twice a day some people say once a day is enough but i don t think so i think you need to do it once in the morning and once in the evening why because your first one at the start anyway will almost always be a fail meditation and your second will be the proper one or sometimes vice versa you will fail a lot in your first few tries maybe even your first few weeks this is to be expected no one turns up at the gym and squats kg first go you will be doing it wrong at the beginning you just gotta push through this in order to get to the real meditation after you ve actually started doing it properly you will continue to do it twice a day the morning meditation will be your get ready for the day meditation closing all your tabs from the day before or you opened while asleep and clearing out for a fresh new browsing session your evening meditation will be your wrapping up the day meditation closing all your tabs you opened during the day and preparing your browser for a good sleep session you will meditate for minutes or minutes minimum some people say minutes but i don t think that s enough for beginners minutes is the amount of time it takes just to settle down into the start of something effective the warm up if doing nothing for minutes seems terrifying for you because you cannot even make it through a minute tv show without checking facebook reddit then you definitely need to start meditating you may feel like you re wasting a bunch of time and that s really what s putting you off you could be doing something better after all but minutes is nothing compared to the rest of the day you spend more time jerking off force yourself to do minutes even if it seems scary at first eventually minutes will feel like absolutely nothing and you ll start wanting to spend more time gt pick a place where you won t be distracted by anything so no tv on in the background or people talking in another room it can get really annoying i m a big fan of spots with an air con humming away or even a washing machine it can be really soothing some people like to use white noise while meditating or binaural beats which i ve found to be really useful as well or hz tones don t ask me why they work but they do at least for me anyway there s just something about them that puts me at ease okay now for the actual process itself gt sit in a chair or on your sofa hands wherever it doesn t really matter some say keep palms facing up but ideally just sit in a way that s comfortable enough that it s not distracting and you don t constantly think about how uncomfortable it is no need to do a crazy lotus posture or anything that s too advanced for you at the moment some people lie down while meditating but i find when i do that i just end up falling half asleep you need to be focused for this gt gt next close your eyes and take some really deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth deep enough so that you can actually hear yourself breathing and someone else near you could too your abdomen should fill with every breath in and you should imagine when you breath out you re breathing out all the bad shit from the day in a physical and spiritual sense imagine all the smoke and particulates and dust that s entered your lungs being expelled and also all the worries and anxieties and anger being blown out with it eventually you ll settle into normal nose breathing but slightly deeper than you re used to gt gt your mind should be racing at the moment that s normal you re probably thinking about a lot of random bullshit most meditation guides will move on from this point and tell you to begin focus but what i ve been doing is taking around mins to actually just think about the things that are bothering me i find if i get all this thinking out of the way first it doesn t nag at me later on during the focus i allow the thoughts to do their dance in my head for a while and then i start gt gt now what you want to do is pick one thing and focus on it entirely think about nothing else except that one thing you re training your concentration after all just like a muscle this won t be easy especially if you re new to it some people pick a chant or phrase or prayer and repeat it over and over some people count to and loop that on the in breath on the out breath and so on some people make a sound and zone in on it this is where you hear the buddhist om if you re playing a binaural beat or frequency you can try and get lost in it entirely but the most common focus that most people will use and is probably the easiest is to focus on the breath gt gt direct your mind entirely on the breath and become the breath be nothing else except the rise and fall the expansion of the body the feeling of the air travelling in and out the small pause in between don t think about it be it gt gt at first your mind will still be full of thoughts each time you catch yourself thinking about something tell it to fuck off silence it gt gt erase it gt gt this really won t be easy at first especially if you re new you ll be thinking about everything and anything and most commonly you ll be thinking gt gt gt gt am i doing this right gt gt gt gt shit i don t know what the fuck i m doing gt gt gt gt how do people do this gt gt gt gt i m just an imposter gt gt maybe i m just not the kind of person who can do this gt gt gt gt i don t get it gt gt this is very normal just actively remove these thoughts from your head some people say allow them to glide in and out don t be forceful i find that i do better if i m strict with them and zap them as soon as i notice they re there gt gt you want to try and achieve periods of nothingness for as long as possible at first it may only be second each time maybe you re a natural and get or but really at the beginning your silent periods will be very short as you get better at it you will have longer and longer silences and each time they will probably be broken by shit i m actually doing it properly aww fuck gt gt at points you may accidentally zone out and end up on a train of thought that lasts for a few minutes and you ll catch yourself eventually and think oh shit i just fucked up for ages that s fine just go back to the breath each time you catch a thought just go back to the breath remember you are you not your thoughts your thoughts are just imposters in your head your goal is to remove them until you re back to base blank slate continue doing this until your minute alarm goes off that s it really not too crazy right alternate and warm up meditations now this isn t the only way to meditate but it s the most common one people use there are a lot more you can do and in fact i ll give you some things to try that might help you get into the right mindset required for proper meditation and warm you up book meditation sit outside in a crowded public place like a train station bench in a park or supermarket grab a book read the book you ll find quickly you re getting distracted by the stimulating things around you when someone walks too close you ll instinctively look up to see them your dick radar will hone in on all the pretty girls people may have loud conversations around you ignore it all try and focus on the book get lost in the book zone out of everything around you and create your own little bubble you should focus entirely on the words on the page and get absorbed in the writing it s not easy especially with the stimulation around you but try and practice this minutes every day i was really bad at this at first i couldn t read unless i had silence and comfort some might be naturals see what you can do music meditation i used to listen to music wherever i went if i was commuting i d have my headphones on rap if i was at the gym i d blast heavy metal during study time lofi hip hop mix beats to relax study to if i forgot my headphones sometimes i d get really anxious and crave the music this is when i began to realise i was hooked onto the comfort music provided and was using it as a cheap dopamine sink miraculously at around the same time as that realisation i lost my headphones entirely they were nice headphones too i considered buying a new pair but then got the message and decided i would try and just go about my life walking eating travelling studying lifting without any music like nofap but nomusic it was hard at first and i got the withdrawal symptoms but after downregulating those receptors i found myself going about my day much more mindfully as i was actually just in the moment more and not lost in the music now when i actually listen to music i make music the task instead of a background accompaniment i lay down and put the song on and really focus on the song no browsing or texting during i try to get lost in the song and let it envelope me actively listening to it this not only helped me appreciate the music more but allowed me to fall for genres that required more concentration to get that didn t need to overload me with dopamine hooks and bridges and drops to keep me invested and i otherwise would not have given a chance to before lifting meditation on that note once i stopped listening to music at the gym i found i lifted better i started focusing much more on the actual act of lifting itself and the movements my form my muscles how the blood travelled in my body if you get into the zone while you lift and don t use music as a pump up but instead focus on your body and its intricacies and the way it works while you perform your music you may find you re able to push through a harder workout than you did before so put away the song or the podcast put your phone in your locker and don t scroll instagram in between sets really just focus on the weights if you find you can t drown out the chart garbage your gym sadly pumps out use your headphones and try white noise or ambient tones to drown it out don t fragment your attention so how do i know if i m actually doing it properly the first few times in fact for some people the first few days or weeks you will pretty much fail each time do not give up it is normal and important to not be very good at it to begin with in fact you re actually making background progress without realising just like lifting keep going twice a day every day learn the movements and proper form and then eventually you ll actually begin lifting heavy now there are a few things that will happen that will clue you into the fact you re getting somewhere and actually astound you at first most people are amazed they can achieve this shit without drugs i call them headaches layers the buzz and fractals bear in mind a few things before i explain this though gt these are identifiers that you ve hit a kind of advanced mode for some people this will never happen i don t know why because this happened to me very quickly once i started meditating i have some suspicions as to why and will discuss them later gt gt if you don t get any of these phenomena that doesn t mean you re not doing the meditation properly or you re not seeing benefits there are those that never get these yet still reap massive benefits i can only speak from experience though meditation is a deeply personal thing and this is what i ve noticed gt gt do not go into the meditation with the purpose of reaching these states you must enter each meditation with no expectations go in completely blank expecting nothing if you force yourself to try and feel a certain way you will block yourself off indefinitely headaches over time as you start achieving longer periods of silence you feel a slight tension behind your eyes or at your temples that can gradually get almost painful i initially placed this down as just an anomaly or dehydration but when it started happening every time i meditated and when eventually the ache would spread up my temple into the middle of my forehead well then i couldn t deny it as you progress the pressure will almost certainly focus itself in the middle of your forehead and sometimes deep in the front centre of your brain there s not really much i can say to explain it except the hippies are probably right this third eye shit is real layers so as you re staring at the inside of your eyes you will be looking at a dark reddish pinkish glow or black if you re in the dark eventually during periods of silence you may find yourself falling into differing layers of darkness now this is not easy to explain at all but you almost definitely will experience it it feels almost like a wave washes over your vision and you re staring at a slightly darker shade of red or black except the colour hasn t actually changed you ve just kind of gone deeper into yourself in fact it may feel like you re retreating away from your eyes and falling into your brain this will happen again and again through multiple layers slowly at first but then quicker and rapidly as you get better at it you may only go through layer or at first and it may be difficult and slow eventually you can hit multiple rapid layers and going through and is easy and natural and you ll wonder how you ever had trouble before the layers will get deeper and deeper and when you lose focus you may go backwards and have to make the journey back the buzz the deeper you fall into the layers the more you ll feel a low deep hum or buzz wash over your body you may also feel as if your head or whole body has began to vibrate it s the same psychedelic buzz you get when you ve taken a strong dose of mushrooms and it can drown out the rest of the noise around you until it s your everything i have pretty bad tinnitus and it was very distracting when i began to meditate until i realised i could incorporate the tinnitus whistle into my focus and it became part of the buzz fractals as you fall deeper into the layers they will start to move rapidly and shapes will begin to form in the darkness at first they will be blurry and undefined kind of like when you accidentally stare at the sun and get a blurry pink spot in your eye for a few seconds before it dissipates like that but over and over again in the darkness these shapes will be shitty concentric circles or squares or pentagons or whatever just as if they were drawn by a kid and they will sink away into the distance and shrink into nothingness only to be replaced by bigger ones taking their place and repeating it will feel as if you are travelling through a tunnel slowly eventually these shapes will begin to solidify and become more regular and intricate the tunnel will travel faster and patterns will begin to emerge and eventually different colours it s actually astounding and very beautiful if you ve ever done a psychedelic it s exactly the same as closed eye visuals it seems the psych just skips the first hundred or so layers and throws you right into astral spacetravel mode when i used to hear that people could achieve these states through meditation i didn t believe them but now i m totally on board i m not able to do it that well yet and my fractals are still weak and shitty but the fact that i even can do this completely sober is really amazing to me sometimes you ll get a closed eye vision like a face or a location or even hear voices that are almost definitely not yours sometime gibberish sometimes snippets of conversation i imagine this is how remote viewers do their thing when this started happening i began taking the meditation more and more seriously and am now pretty dedicated to it if i have the ability to make myself trip twice a day i totally will gt but heathcliff i ve been meditating for years and i ve never experienced this surely you are wrong maybe i am i m not sure i definitely experience these things though i think it may have to do with a few things i used to do deep dose psychedelic drugs and i use fluoride free toothpaste try meditating while drunk or high one time and see if you can achieve layers or fractals also try cutting out fluoride for at least half a year and if you re serious attempting other pineal decalcification methods see if your results change then so that s it my guide on meditation it s not hocus pocus bullshit and it genuinely does help you feel more in control of your life time gets slower people become more interesting and the days turn out better i d like you to try it for a week at least don t give up as soon as it gets hard or boring attempt it properly for a week and see where you get to you might find that switching off your autopilot twice a day is enough to give you control of your anxiety and procrastination or you might find yourself blasting off into astral planes and meeting ethereal entities who knows i have a subreddit link in my profile
14974,introduction school season is here and many people can use tips on how to have better study sessions here is a list with techniques that will help you be more productive in school i have broken up this list into sections a b c and as bite sized pieces so you can find information easier i tried to stay away from generic advise like get organized or sit in the front row this is a long post so i recommend you read it on the treadmill at the toilet introduction a pomodoro technique b phone on airplane mode c avoid daygame environments d know your circadian rhythms e whiteboards f get stuff done secondary user account g no study groups h do small chunks i growth mindset chinese productivity j mood regulation k environmental triggers l plate management m no mental health excuses n active reading o note styles p oneitis prevention r procrastination learned helplessness s time management t don t multi task u stop socializing with classmates v sleep hygiene and nutrition w spectatorism x crab mentality y take breaks z supplemental learning a pomodoro technique the pomodoro technique can help you power through distractions enter hyperfocus and get things done in short bursts while taking frequent breaks to come up for air start by concentrating intensely on a task without interruptions for minutes and then take a minute break as you improve your pomodoro increase the time by minute intervals until you can reach hour in concentration minute break there are plenty of pomodoro apps you can use the science behind is that you train your mind to enter focused mode and the diffused mode the focused mode is like having a target lock like a missile while the diffused mode is to see the big picture like the forest for the trees the book a mind for numbers goes into great detail about focused mode and diffused mode b phone on airplane mode for those that are not on monk mode you must prevent smartphone distractions while studying almost every time i see someone studying at starbucks i see them check their phone every few minutes people can wait an hour for you to text them back it is not important to see how many likes your recent post got or if you re tinder matches have replied back if you must check your phone i recommend you check it during your pomodoro breaks if you re a self described phone addict put your phone on greyscale mode when going on social media using accessibility settings you can even program your phone to enter greyscale mode with three home button clicks if for some you cannot have your phone on airplane mode then set the phone on no disturb mode so you don t hear a ping every time you get a message even better disable social media but for most of you that is too extreme of an option c avoid daygame environments you need to find a cave somewhere and hide from the world if you re frequently distracted by beautiful women you must avoid starbucks and areas where they can be found in plenty this is especially important if you re like me and love to daygame beautiful women everywhere you go if you lift and look decent you must hide from women because those iois are very tempting and distracting college campuses are notorious for having beautiful women in cafeterias the library and sitting by themselves everywhere if you must study in areas where beautiful women are plentiful i highly recommend you wear a hat with a hoodie that blocks your peripheral vision going to school full time and practicing how to get women at the same time is not efficient save your sexual tension and social times for the weekend when your study time is finished the hour of social life you sacrifice right now will be four hours of extra free time in the future d know your circadian rhythms identify if you re the most alert in the morning afternoon or evenings and schedule your study times around those hours i am very sluggish in the morning but quite alert in the evening you should also identify if you re the type that becomes more concentrated before or after going to the gym for some individuals studying right after a gym session gives is their peak mental performance other people have to sleep or get very tired after a gym session be aware of how many hours of sun you get and try use your bed only for studying for people with adhd recognize when you re in hyperfocus mode and those with mood disorders like borderline bipolar schizoaffective and ptsd recognize when your moods are depressed stable and manic e whiteboards get yourself a large dry erase whiteboard and an assortment of color markers on this whiteboard write when homework assignments are due and random thoughts you need reminders of put this whiteboard somewhere highly visible at your home even thou you have a smartphone with calendar apps to do list apps or schedule apps it s easy to dismiss those messages and notifications a big white board with colored text is a greater reminder to get you to realize you have stuff done if you re the highly distracted type i recommend you place it on the wall on top of the toilet because every time you take a piss you standing up you will be reminded what you have to do you can also buy a chores whiteboard and checkmark the days you study for your class f get stuff done secondary user account if you re easily distracted online or have large computer game collections i suggest you create a secondary user account on your desktop computer or laptop this secondary account should not have access to your computer games or social media profiles the bare minimum applications like a web browser needed to get schoolwork done i would even go as far as installing the get focusd extension on your main account and use the nuclear option to block all internet access except for whitelisted sites this will force you to use your secondary account and get stuff done if you live with your parents attempt to use your laptop outside your room if they catch you wasting time they will let you know g no study groups unless absolutely required for class do not do voluntary study groups with classmates trust me you will just end up having a social gathering and chit chat i see this all the time with the high school students at starbucks they sit on the table and just talk talk talk nothing gets done if you are a social learner and need a study group to find a male and study with him on make sure your study partner is an organized male who wants to get an a in class absolutely avoid doing a study group with of women and people who are very social they will treat the study session as hangout time and nothing will get done h do small chunks study for your classes in small chunks almost every day instead of rushing to the last minute the blue pill way of studying is to cram hours of studying the day before the test the red pill way is to gradually add bricks of information to your mental wall by studying small chunks almost every day you allow your mental wall sufficient time for the cement to dry and store knowledge in your long term memory cramming hours of information at once is like adding too many information bricks to your mental wall and causing it to collapse because the cement is to wet to hold that many bricks trsut me you will underestimate the amount of time required to get homework done work a little every day i growth mindset chinese productivity it is theorized that chinese students do excellent in school due to their growth mindset and hard work mentalities chinese students to have chiku an intrinsic belief that anything is possible with hard work and a lack of effort rather than of intelligence is to blame for poor grades in chinese academics is believed that there is little difference between the intelligence of student and academic success is based on their efficient use of time to produce the best work chinese students are trained to have a growth mindset if they aren t doing well they ll work harder and they ll be successful american children tend to be trained to have a fixed mindset about academics their abilities are largely predetermined and static if they aren t doing well it s because they re not good at it the idea of growth mindset can be further explored in the books little soldiers by lenora chu and mindset by dr carol s dweck j mood regulation it may sound like common sense but you should monitor your energy levels and general mood and find patterns discover what events lower your dopamine and which give to dopamine overload when dopamine is either too high or low it causes attention anxiety and focuses issues identify when you tend to feel irritated stressed depressed and when you tend to feel calm focused and exited for those with adhd me bipolar disorder schizoaffective disorder or ptsd discover what triggers your depressed states and manic states for me i know that being really social with women will trigger my adhd mania state and i will be too euphoric to concentrate on reading i also am aware that not going to the gym for more than three days will trigger my depressed state due to low dopamine i highly recommend that if your moods are irregular to use a mood app like daylio and identify triggers and times when your mood is bad k environmental triggers identify objects that trigger you to be distracted in certain environments for most of you the video game console computer and your television make it easy to be distracted if you have a television y you find yourself watching tv shows or video games instead of studying unplug the hdmi cable and put it on top of your fridge if you have an internet addiction or pc game addiction leave the house and go study at starbucks or library social addictions like having bae lover come over to suck dick means you must get you to get your work done first and schedule her to come over later the point is that you must change your environment if you have too many distraction triggers l plate management one of the biggest distractions in young men is spending too much time communicating with women you need to tell your plates that you have study hours and that you will not be able to communicate with them a simple i m really busy between pm to pm because of class is usually enough you need to develop a mentality that your education comes before hoes and you need to be in a social cave to get studying a good advice is to text your hoes when you re at the gym and have to rest between sets even better adopt a text for logics strategy like we have been telling you here in theredpill for years put your phone on greyscale mode when texting them to minimize the dopamine rush m no mental health excuses it is very easy to blame adhd me depression and other mental disorders for not being motivated focused or productive enough to get stuff done the same applies to take medication you have to understand that school is a competitive atmosphere and it doesn t matter if you have a disadvantage there is no room to have a victim mentality the only thing universities care about is your g p a and grades that s the cold hard truth if you have a mental disorder you must find efficient methods to get work done you might have to work harder than others develop new ways of time efficiency or adopt unconventional study methods if you have adhd or depression it means you must do intense exercise before studying those with schizophrenia might need music therapy and those with ptsd might need to use brown noise apps to block background noise if you have a serious mental health condition and take medication to identify the times you are the most stable for study ask your disability center if you can get priority registration to take online classes or what accommodations they offer n active reading active reading simply means reading something with a determination to understand and evaluate it for its relevance to your needs simply reading and re reading the material isn t an effective way to understand and learn actively and critically engaging with the content can save you time this means that you read the material four times the first time read the material casually and skim through the second time identify key points of the material and identify the why of the chapter most textbooks identify why for you at the beginning of the chapter in bold letters the third time take notes of the material in an outline style finally for the fourth time read the textbook and create a one two sentence summary for every paragraph or major subtopic o note styles there is three general note taking styles outline cornell and mapping method the traditional style is the outline which uses titles subheadings and details to create a hierarchy of information the cornell style creates deliberate space in the margins of their notes for summarization questions and connections and focuses on revisiting notes to help organize knowledge and make learning stick the mapping method uses a whiteboard or mind map software to group information in geometric shapes if you re the highly organized type the outline method probably suits you the best while those with adhd should use the mapping method i highly recommend you google note taking styles to learn more p oneitis prevention having oneitis is a mental virus that robs you of your attention focus and willpower do everything in your power to avoid getting oneitis this school session if you feel like helping her study its time to stop that is a recipe for level oneitis hot girls are notorious for finding a nerd to do their work for the unwritten promise of pussy they will tease you and treat you really nice but after the class is over she is gone be aware of this trap other hot girls will give you their number to study together but in reality they are just using you for notes or homework copying back in my beta days in the ancient past i remember a hot girl asking me if i could do her online economics class for sex after i tool her finals i am happy i turned it down but i m pretty sure some other nerd got cause in that trap the reality is that as soon as you do her finals you will be blocked there are plenty of guides here on theredpill that offer tips on how to avoid having an oneitis if you are still blue pilled or fall in love easily this is the time to disable social media many bright students have had their academics annihilated due to hyper focusing on their magical unicorn this is of special concern to those here who have adhd and have their brain think of one hundred scenarios on how to get a girl if you already have an oneitis its time to go soft contact and if you need help make a post on asktrp amp nbsp r procrastination learned helplessness this section is from a future post called how to theredpill with your adhd pt i have striked through the irrelevant parts for this mainstream audience gt helplessness is the wife gt procrastination is the side girl gt the first steal your head and time gt the second wants your whole world mr badass r learn helplessness happens when a person suffers from a sense of powerlessness and can t complete a task and procrastination is the action of delaying or postponing something to later in street terms learn helplessness is like a wife who is always nagging you to not do something and is making you feel bad about yourself when you take initiative procrastination is like your busty side girl who always wants you to see you when work has to be done procrastination gives you lots of attention and is always happy to see you compared to the wife helplessness who seems to put you down all the time the reason procrastination and learned helplessness happens is that adhd individuals are low in the executive function called task initiation which is a fancy way of saying that their brain has trouble a starting tasks b making decisions or c feels helpless to get started r learned helplessness the wife in learned helplessness the individual doesn t get a task started due to fear low self esteem or has a self image of being told he is lazy dumb or useless over and over in practical terms the most common learned helplessness phrases are it is too hard i m not smart good enough to do this or i ll never be able to do this successfully many people have procrastination due to finding a task irritating and hard to deal with like a nagging wife think of learned helplessness as the nagging wife of the typical blue pilled marriage who constantly tells the husband that they re forgetful lazy dumb or unmotivated why bother getting started if pain and displeasure are what the experience will be in the adhd brain getting started is hard because of the person constantly being told they re not good enough their brain the nagging wife won t stop putting them down and sometimes scares them with what if over analyzation the best way to deal with learned helplessness is to achieve small victories that make you feel good examples of small victories are brushing your teeth making your bed and eating a healthy breakfast another strategy to deal with learned helplessness is to adopt the abc method for reframing negative situations r procrastination the side girl in the case of procrastination the individual has a displeasure of doing something unenjoyable and prefers a dopamine boost from doing something fun procrastination like being in a marriage and having a side girl who is fun and doesn t require responsibilities the side girl is there for a good time and is happy to give you attention even thou there is work to be done she is a time waster but she makes you feel like the man the best way to deal with procrastination is to break up with her and do no contact in practical terms this means to change your environment and eliminate distraction triggers if you have a video game addiction go to starbucks to get your homework done if you are a busy social butterfly put that phone on airplane mode amp nbsp s time management if you re like me you probably have a spontaneous way of scheduling your time you tend to do your studying when you have free time or when you feel like it the reality is that this is a very inefficient method of studying whether you realize it or not the majority of the time you will underestimate how long something takes to do the truth is that you can let inspiration or motivation determine your study schedule the only master should be discipline just like the iron barbell at the gym will never lie to you about your strength discipline is the cold hard steel that will never lie to you about productivity you need to schedule your study time use deadlines and time limits to your advantage even if you don t technically have a deadline on a task set one for yourself develop predictable patterns that use your time the most efficiently if you re truly the distracted or spontaneous type then checklists are your best friend i recommend the app any do or any checklist app that has alarm reminders like i mentioned in section e whiteboards if you are always distracted put a whiteboard on the wall on top of your toilet so you know your schedule every time you take a piss t don t multi task it s silly to me when i see people trying to study three different subjects in between each other if you have english math and science class create a chronological time block for each subject the silly thing to do is to spend an hour on your english reading two hours on your math homework and then go back to your english reading for an hour a better thing to do is focus two hours on english homework and then two hours on math homework a crazier scenario is when students are studying and cooking dinner at the same time either give your full attention to studying or cooking u stop socializing with classmates if you re a self aware people pleaser do not make friends with your classmates even better don t talk to other people in class or attempt to make friends they don t care about you as soon as the class is over its statistical that they will disappear a classroom is an artificial environment and people will try to take advantage of you every single time there will be someone with a sympathy story and ask you for notes or to peer review your homework for me it s extremely common for classmates to ask me for the class e book i found on libgen sorry it s watermarked and i can t share it is my go to response others get butt hurt when i won t let them borrow my e book or textbook to copy it not my problem and they will share the copies with everyone the truth is the classroom is a competitive atmosphere so why would i give them an advantage if you must must have a classroom buddy you need to qualify them and see if they re the serious and studious type the classroom buddy must be a person who wants to succeed in class be very alert of letting losers and unmotivated people try to push you around v sleep hygiene and nutrition having quality sleep and eating the right food is fundamental to be at your peak mental performance this means you need to fuel your body with quality macros and get your hours of sleep i would highly recommend you take melatonin g g for three days before bed to establish a sleep schedule i m sure you re very aware that you need to use a blue light filter at night don t have caffeine after pm and to drink enough water most students don t get adequate sleep and eat junk food all day if you want to be at your most productive your sleep and nutrition need to be at their best if you don t get enough sunlight it means to take vitamin d and if you lift weights find an appropriate diet plan having get sleep hygiene and nutrition will give you a great advantage in class w spectatorism most people are spectators who try to escape reality and are addicted to boredom it hurts them to think others are spectators because they have too much mental energy that s not being used identify if you frequently daydream always have ass titties on your mind or are obsessed with some video game sports team or television show you should not be thinking of game of thrones all day for most people the reason they do this is because they re afraid of dealing with stone cold reality or they need mental stimulation spectatorism steals your attention and must be managed if you want an a in class you need to give it your full attention if there is something that is always stealing your attention you need to find techniques on how to deal with it i suggest you good maladaptive daydreaming and i m sure there is a redpill post about that too if you absolutely have to watch your sports game then do your homework before the game starts for people that are obsessed with video games you need to understand that you have work to do use the pomodoro technique to train yourself to focus on homework for at least minutes x crab mentality a common theme for college athletes and frat boys is that their teammates will attempt to sabotage their academic future most people are sheep and don t put an emphasis on academic performance the teammates will complain that you re spending too much time at the library or the frat boys will nag you that you don t spend enough time at social functions you need to understand that college is to get a degree and extracurricular activities are the second priority i have heard stories of people having roommates call them nerds because they are always studying in their free time fuck them certain minorities especially mexican americans have fathers that make fun of you for reading books and acting white realize that if you have people in your life that try to bring you down you must do your best to not be around them also be aware of doing too much extracurricular activities like student senate or school clubs at the end of the day what matters most is your g p a y take breaks you need to take breaks between study sessions and be careful of trying to do too much at once the reason you need to take breaks is for stress management i m assuming since you visit theredpill you lift weights are aware of meditation and maybe watch porn those are great stress relievers i highly recommend the pomodoro technique i mentioned in section a so you study for a predetermined amount of time and then take a break stress management is very important so you don t get burned out if you don t have a fulltime job i highly recommend you treat school as a full time job spend hours a week studying and if you finish all you work then work ahead of schedule this means you study for hours take a hour lunch and then study fours z supplemental learning most a students use youtube videos edx courses libgen and websites to learn about a subject more efficiently just relying upon the professor s powerpoint slides the textbook and homework might not fit your learning style most people have one or a combination of kinesthetic visual reading or audio learning styles i highly recommend you google learning styles to learn more if you re in a biology class a youtube video about the cell might help you learn faster than reading the textbook twice you need to discover your learning style and find supplemental learning material that benefits your learning style
15250,you can scroll down to where it says enter pua if you want to skip the long backstory tl dr i m here to dispel a few myths tell you to stop over analyzing with stuff like day game and neg and validation and all kinds of techniques or methods with fancy names names like chad and virgin don t count just be a normal friggin human being every girl is different and it s up to both you and her to steer the ship alright so when i was a kid i was kind of normal and maybe even a bit of a d d pimp look at it carefully but as you ll see later in life i hate to admit it but i became a bit of a dweeb in some senses so here s a little bit of history of mine with girls growing up i was a really short kid this is important in the last year of primary school i m australian i had a crush on this girl we ll call felicia i was already friends with her friend we ll call matilda matilda was a tall fun smart and polite girl who everyone respected she introduced me to hugging girls she would just come up to me because we were friends and give me hugs somehow this introduced me to getting hugs from her small circle of female friends which felicia was part of felicia was always talking about how much she liked certain brads which made me feel inferior and that i d never get her approval but on the other hand i was the one who would be going to her house every day after school and getting cuddles from her she introduced the definition to me that a hug was a brief hello or goodbye and a cuddle was when you are holding each other for an extended period of time weird that i was insecure about that yeah in the first year of high school which comes after primary in australia i walked up to this small girl reading a book we ll call her tiana i said hi and noticed she was reading about horoscopes she asked what my sign was and when i told her she just goes we re not compatible go away i wasn t sad about being rejected i just thought it was weird this is even more important that me being short i became a victim of childhood clinical depression eventually half way through the year all the girls in my homeroom and i mean all of them except the greek girls saw that i was withdrawn and not smiling they thought i was cute because i was so small and they chose to befriend me one of them we ll call jemima tall acne moody panic attacks had a thing for me but that was kinda gay point a real chad can get the girls even if he isn t confident and tall amp x b after i became friends with these girls the small girl tiana opened up to me i went on my first date with her to the shopping center where we just fooled around no kissing or holding hands but just being kids after that date she was telling all the girls that i was her boyfriend and all the guys at school were making fun of me because they thought she was a becky i told her we were just friends i don t know how she felt about that moving on amp x b this being short thing was really paying off matilda was like hey i play tennis with this girl pseudonym monique who thinks short guys are cute come to the club after school so i did shared some hugglie wugglies and then we were boyfriend girlfriend which meant i could kiss her on the cheek and hold her hand in hindsight this was strange because most of my romantic feelings were for felicia even though we never kissed or held hands and having another girlfriend seemed completely unrelated before i knew it i had four girlfriends at once monique felicia sarah and i can t remember the fourth one probably jemima monique went to a different school so no one knew her even though she was a total stacey i kept my feelings for felicia under the radar but it caught wind when i kissed sarah that i was uncool because she was considered another becky sarah ended up finding out about how much of a playa i was she said something like girls don t like it when you have more than one girlfriend and we broke up i stopped seeing monique for whatever reason i m sorry for all the blank moments this was years ago my feelings for felicia remained unrequited as i was too nervous to pursue or initiate any kind of intimacy beyond what we already had which had diminished since primary school and jemima was just rotten in year i was mad into skateboarding i was at the skate park every day after school my hair was getting long my depression was lifting i was becoming way less shy and conservative and started doing fun stupid stuff with my childhood friend jimmy that young boys do like riding shopping trolleys showing your ass to traffic and putting dogshit on a public barbecue in australia we have public barbecues in our parks it s friggin awesome and so convenient for family days at the park all the staceys were starting to dig me but they were all conceited bimbos to me so i snobbed them and retained my status as an independent chad skater kid instead of a conformist popular kid brad which jimmy was felicia became just a normal friend and it s like my childhood romantic feelings for her were never there to begin with now here s where things got mega saucy felicia her friend jackie whose older brother was a mad local skater stoner and this other cute girl michelle invited me and my two asian skate mates jayse and mark to come over to jackie s house because her parents were gone so we could try get drunk we were so we struggled to find someone to give us booze so eventually we just stayed up all night and ended up sleeping on her trampoline eventually out of nowhere jeise just says wow jackie s tits are really soft come over here and feel them so we did and it was mega saucy having the first time ever to touch tits this then progressed to me getting to grab felicia s and michelle s cuddled with felicia for the rest of the night none of that romantic feeling just mega horny she wouldn t let me get in her pants though point asian dudes can get white chicks even in high school something got ultra spicy stronger than mega sauce we had a school swimming day and i was so horny because of all the chicks in bikinis i decided to do something that some may considere creepy point what some may consider creepy may actually be helpful in the right context amp x b i thought it would be awesome if i swam under and grabbed felicia s ass and then swam way far away so she wouldn t see me come up out of the water and know it was me she eventually figured out it was me and she was mega into it this is where i got to finger my first girl in the pool with everyone none the wiser that s a spicy a meatball amp x b all of this frivolous behaviour ended i didn t notice it was just part of life or the game if you will i ll get into that later eventually i got a crush on this girl i d never spoken too i just thought her pale skin black hair and blue eyes were beautiful we ll call her belinda i only got to eventually talk to her the next year enter year i had a reaaal dark tan from all of that time at the skate park i saw belinda sitting down on a bench here s another thing some may find creepy i spontaneously hugged her from behind and asked what her name was her friend too a photo of it which still exists to this day year camp came and i talk to her she liked my ponytail i had to stop skating due to a long term knee injury so instead of hanging out with the chads i was hanging out with the virgin geeks and getting into heavy metal like iron maiden and megadeth belinda later told me she was also a fan of legend of zelda ocarina of time was my favourite game i told her i had feelings for her and then we were teenage sweeties i would basically hold her hand during recess and kiss her on the cheek at the end of the day kissing on the lips for me was too daring and should be reserved for a special moment coming from a dude who fingered a chick in a pool a year ago i know right eventually when i went to give her goodbye kiss she turned her head so my lips met hers instead of her cheek i didn t know she did this and i thought that i had accidentally kissed her on the lips so i apologised like a hundred times that i didn t mean to rush things like that point girls are just as eager as guys just don t be a dumb faggot and you re fine amp x b we broke up and she went for my mate paul he was even shorter than me wore glasses and was often called harry potter for his looks point you don t need to get contact lenses and start being a fag at the gym trying to grow some muscles to get chicks amp x b this part was funny as i didn t get jealous because i just considered belinda as a good friend but the drama surrounding this was really entertaining belinda went to paul s house with another geeky friend geekmaster he was the coolest of the geeks knew how to hack and all other kinds of cool computer stuff they were playing video games and belinda put a pillow over paul s lap and gave me a schneaky handy this act was obvious to geekmaster so word ended up getting out among our virgin circle amp x b enter year my chestnut brown hair had grown to its peak length and because the geeks were no longer in my homeroom i hung out with jimmy more at the end of the year i was becoming really depressed was skipping school and basically becoming that guy that a lot of guys into pua relate to the depressed recluse who has no chicks in his life because my lack of attendance i had to repeat the year level same thing happened depressed reclusive skipping school ended up leaving because jimmy was a bit of a brad he would always poke fun at me for being a virgin i started playing guitar because of my interest in metal a neighbourhood girl elise who was a piano prodigy and also into rock and metal invited me over to talk about music there was nothing sexual or romantic about this we just wanted to talk about music she asked if she knew some of the bands on her ipod she mentioned kalmah and i was like how do you know about kalmah she told me her friend sandra showed them to her and she was really into black metal too sandra had the reputation of being one of the ugliest most undesirable girls in school elise was mega popular so she had a huge house party for her birthday i didn t drink or do drugs back then and i bumped into a drunk sandra i told her i thought it was cool that she was into black metal and we became friends she messaged me at midnight and invited me to meet her at the train station we ended up going back to my room and having my first tongue kiss we didn t screw because i had no protection but two weeks later we both lost our virginity to each other and just became rampant sex fiends we didn t notice it at first but our friendship had vanished and just turned into sex we were just having sex all the frigging time and our emotions became dull i still feel that numbness point heaps of sex doesn t necessarily make you happy you could be using it to compensate for a real relationship as an escape it could even be an addiction amp x b i had sex with one more girl and had interest in one other we kissed but never had sex and then my reclusiveness got worse i went to the local pub where all the people my age went and my mate who i did taekwondo with adam who was also a geek virgin but had become a total chad at this point told me dude read this book called the game it ll teach you how to pick up chicks enter pua amp x b i had nothing going on no job no chicks the only socialising i did was thursday nights at the pub where all the uni students went and i was confronted with this game book thing i read it and joined my city s online lair i did the gay noob stuff i peacocked i used canned openers i negged i used stupid terms like number close and kiss close and wrote field reports of every time i sarged when i look back to who i was in the pua scene i hate looking at that guy i see him as a creepy guy who thinks that the game of getting along with chicks is all about sex and quantity you re told it s a numbers game you get as many girls and phone numbers as you can so you increase your chances you ve heard it a jillion times it s about improving your lifestyle not using tricks and techniques my past experiences growing up validate this but i m here to expand on that and show that your lifestyle even if you re a fat odorous neckbeard does not require that much change you don t need to change how you dress you don t need to start working your ass off at the gym just to feel good and impress people you re impressing guys more than you re impressing girls with those muscles trust me what you need instead of tricks techniques methods or a lifestyle change is just a few things such as respect honesty and integrity this talk about nice guys finish last is the biggest fattest lie that all incels believe being nice is the best thing you can do just don t be a suck up faggot let s go over the points i made above about success with women point a real chad can get the girls even if he isn t confident and tall i m still a pretty short guy i have long hair i don t do my laundry often so i sleep in my clothes and wear them for days on end i don t shower often i don t shave often why do girls still like me because i m honest with myself i tell myself look dude you don t take care of yourself i m honest to the women in my life i let my mum know everything in my life i tell girls from the get go what i think about them in a respectful manner i respect myself i tell myself i still like you you might just be going through some things right now so why should i judge you so harshly about how much you re taking care of yourself i have integrity i know very well that i probably smell and look dishevelled so i act on that i accept who i am in that moment and if i want to improve on it i do if i don t want to improve on it that s okay too so long as i accept the consequences point asian dudes can get white chicks even in high school honesty you like white chicks black chicks whatever colour chicks don t deny it let yourself interact with whatever kind of woman you like her interest in you will depend on how you treat her treat yourself and treat others respect don t play racial stereotypes unless it s funny lmao if a purple or whatever coloured chick is being a snooty bitch it doesn t mean all of them are like that and it doesn t mean she s like that all the time respect that everybody is different and that people change in all kinds of different ways integrity your parents are traditional don t ditch that your culture is great i m not saying everyone s culture is perfect some have misogynistic elements etc but don t pretend like you don t eat kimchi and rice with chopsticks at home be content with who you are and i m sure a cool chick will be interested too kimchi is friggin delicious and exotic point what some may consider creepy may actually be helpful in the right context honesty get it out of your system don t bottle it up i don t condone any of my sexual behaviours that i had expressed earlier but to put it in context i would say that if i had not expressed my sexuality i would have bottled it up and who knows how that may be expressed in my later years as a depressed recluse i m not saying go grabbing chicks asses at your school s swimming carnival what i m saying is express your desires it would have been a lot more appropriate if i told someone that i trusted about how i was thinking or feeling you can see countless examples of incel neckbeard dudes text messages to girls where they write a long love note even longer than this post and they get rejected my favourite one ended with the girl saying shut the fuck up you incel if you actually talk about your thoughts and feelings you can get it off your back and your friends and family can help you through those thoughts and feelings respect once again i do not condone grabbing the hot chick s ass not just because in hindsight get it hind sight that it could be creepy but in my example above i actually had context that she would not find it creepy because i knew her and had sexual experiences with her before i am telling you to respect boundaries being sexual or not is your own damn responsibility but there is something you need to know go for it but respect the boundaries go for the gold but don t jump down the mineshaft integrity this goes with honesty be honest with expressing your thoughts and feelings in an appropriate manner to an appropriate person don t fuck around point girls are just as eager as guys just don t be a dumb faggot and you re fine honesty kinda takes the pressure off eh guys as with above exercise respect to boundaries and you re fine respect acknowledge signs of interests that you re getting from a girl ask her about it do you feel about are you smiling at me because or or are you just happy gauge her interest in you and there s the green light for you to pursue don t run red lights unless you want to crash integrity it goes to show how these things go both ways the beautiful thing about a healthy relationship between a guy and girl is that you work together you only pursue the other when you have the indication from them and you are treated likewise this way you are holding each other accountable for your thoughts feelings beliefs and actions i m not married but i know enough to say that a proper healthy marriage is a status where this kind of accountability is demonstrated in its entirety point you don t need to get contact lenses and start being a fag at the gym trying to grow some muscles to get chicks honesty do you actually like exercise or are you doing it just to basically become a different person don t be someone you re not if you like exercise go ahead be lance armstrong or ahhhhnold but you don t have to work your ass off in unrelated areas of your life just to impress girls most girls really could not give a crap about your muscles what are you growing your muscles for anyway other than for a hobby do you really need to be able to deadlift kg to be able to function in your daily life only change yourself for what you honestly want to change don t make it so friggin difficult respect if you can accept yourself for being who you are in the moment then you can accept others too as i said earlier i can be a really lazy guy who doesn t always take care of his hygiene because i can respect myself for being a lazy slob it means i have no place to judge other people chad respects his fellow virgins and neckbeards despite their differences integrity goes in hand with what i said about being honest to yourself in this field you prefer glasses over contacts take advantage of it wear a different style or say a cool thing every time you put them on like horatio from csi miami you don t like going to the gym take advantage of it be like me and brag like a jerk how you have no need to work out because it has no benefit in functioning in my daily life turn that poop into wine point heaps of sex doesn t necessarily make you happy you could be using it to compensate for a real relationship as an escape it could even be an addiction i personally believe this is the most important point that i have to make disagree all you like but i believe that your goal should not always just be sex many of you may have started your journey into your change of lifestyle or pua or whatever because you were a shy recluse or something like that that s okay remember when you were having fun when you were young sex was not on your mind you were enjoying other things go ahead and find whatever it is that you enjoy you wanna keep on playing video games cool keep on playing video games and maybe you ll find a nice gamer girl to marry at comic con or whatever honesty if you can tell your romantic interest honestly that you want to reserve your sexuality until marriage or a special occasion or something if she doesn t respect that she ll probably leave you or pressure you into it however if she truly appreciates the idea i believe it would be likely that the both of you would grow in trust as you re not trying to impress the other one just to get what you want sexually respect your partner or not even yourself may be interested in sex at the time most guys can t function after they ve climaxed how would you feel if your partner pressured you into more sex after you re all tired you can learn to respect that both men and women have their times that they want to enjoy or not enjoy sex or even any other activity integrity i knew a guy who became part of a dating and lifestyle coaching company he ended up telling me how little self esteem he had in himself that even though he could bang hundreds of chicks he felt so inferior when he saw me playing guitar do you really want to be a sex obsessed macho man just to be superior to other men or do you want to enjoy all facets of life to the fullest if you got this far i thank you for getting so far and listening to me and i also apologise for writing such a long essay i just felt that i had something to offer to the community of men who want to have a richer life experience and also to have great relationships with women whether it is your girlfriend a friend your sister your aunt your mum the queen of england etc peace out dawgz
15636,it s been over a year since i posted my ultimate tinder roadmap i also did a part part part this is part it s not so much of an add on as much as it is a refresh i ll hit on or rehash points i covered in part or part but deal with it muh it seems like every post on trp these days about tinder bumble and other apps is nothing but a poster shitting all over them and then other posters circlejerking in agreement about how dumb online dating apps are and how we all need to avoid them if you think that online dating apps like tinder and bumble are not worthwhile and say that men shouldn t bother with them because they only exist for female validation or that its only useful for the top of men or that you should only focus on in person game or any other hamstering garbage to justify why you think they are stupid you suck dick by choice got that trp has been infected with a plague of incel mgtow losers who do nothing but shit on online dating apps and whine and cry about it let me tell you something you have nothing to lose by using a dating app so why would you just avoid it all together there has to be only one explanation you suck dick by choice and use grindr muh tinder only has girls on there who want validation so that doesn t mean of them are faggot muh tinder only works if you are in the top so that doesn t mean have a defeatist attitude again the competition sucks it doesn t take much to have a top tinder profile cum guzzler muh online dating is useless muh in person game instead who said you can t do both cocksucker i guarantee you the comment sections will be filled with the garbage above anyway who didn t do anything except see the title of the post and rush down to comment if you shit all over online dating apps you re just bitter that you suck at it or the more likely explanation you suck dick by choice chances are if you are reading this you aren t one of those types and therefore do not suck dick by choice moving on the rule of tinder your pictures are everything they will single handedly dictate your success or failure if you aren t getting matches its because of your pictures i guarantee it scouting one of the optional things you can do is create a female burner account on your computer you can use tinder from a computer and scout the men in your area you ll see your competition is mostly pathetic however the men with the highest elo scores generally are shown first so you can get an idea of who the top men in the area are off the bat i am not sure how consistent this is as i have seen some lousy men shown off the bat when doing this this is probably explained by new profiles also getting a boost and shown toward the top most men suck at this realize this and capitalize on it that s why i say it doesn t take much to have a top tinder profile the douche assumption all women who use these apps automatically assume without hesitation that every man they will come across is a creep or a douche or most commonly both it s up to you your profile and your pictures and eventually your messages game when you match to unqualify yourself as a creepy douche if you have to ask yourself if your bio or your pictures make you look like a creep or a douche it probably is the better your pictures are the better your profile and the better looking you are the more benefit of the doubt you will get to recap mallardcove s tinder maxim you are guilty of being a creepy douche to every woman who you come across on these apps until you prove yourself innocent picture selection picture selection is your greatest asset here it will make or break you if you aren t getting matches chance your pictures suck you can blame the algorithims or ego or the sluts who only care about validation and the top of top of chads but i can assure you its because your pictures suck the most important piece of this entire guide in the paragprah below obviously looking as good and attractive and well put together in your photos is important but its not the only piece of the puzzle your pictures need to tell an emotional story you know how women like to be taken on a roller coaster of emotions when you are with them you need to do the same with your pictures they need to take the woman who is viewing them on an emotional ride they have to inspire emotion and excitement i once put pictures on my tinder profile that all scored or higher on photofeeler i was not getting many matches because while i had the attractive part of the puzzle down the problem is my pictures were boring it appeared like the pictures were more a part of a photoshoot specifically for tinder nothing comes across as more pathetic than a group of pictures that represented my exciting life your best picture needs to go first otherwise she won t look at your other your first picture needs to clearly show your face and your entire body if possible it needs to be your best all around picture smiling too much is bad especially if you are looking into the camera i see a lot of tinder advice guides online that say smiling is good but its not you get one smiling while looking into the camera picture max and it can t go first if you have to have more pictures of you smiling make sure it is not looking at the camera shirtless pictures are fine as long as you have the pack and muscles to back it up and it has to be candid no selfies shirtless mirror pics or obviously staged pics it has to be outdoors you re looking for plausible deniability here if it appears like your shirtless picture was staged you get tagged as a douche and she ll swipe left a beach or lake is your best bet for plausible deniability here avoid selfies of any kind no outstreched arm pics pics of you sitting in your car or at your computer or mirror selfies no that s boring and weak it makes it appear like your life is so boring that your best pictures are ones you had to take yourself in boring situations avoid pictures of you doing douchey shit like flexing your arms avoid pictures that come across as douchey like pictures taken at the gym boat pictures are usually good but make sure you only have one try to have at least one group picture where you are not the only one in the shot dress well in the pictures that call for it basically here are picture types that you can t go wrong with in no particular order the outdoors picture a picture of you doing something outdoors the picture i have used for this one is a picture of me hiking taken slightly overhead with my drone so the height of how high i was up compared to ground level is on display hiking fishing boating camping etc work here the action picture a picture of you doing something in action differs from the outdoors picture because this one is meant to be captured in the movement while the outdoors picture is more of a still picture the picture i have used for this one is a picture of me cliff jumping swimming sports motorsports skydiving and such work here avoid pictures of skateboarding and only use biking if you are doing some kind of crazy jump if you own a gopro action camera it might not be a bad idea to use a picture or video still the leather jacket picture can t go wrong with a leather jacket probably the best outerwear accessory that can be used women love guys in leather jackets if you can pull it off if you are a fatass won t work but if you are in shape you can t lose with a leather jacket just make sure the shot is candid the leather jacket picture i use is one of me leaning on a balcony in las vegas overlooking the strip the travel picture a picture of you at some kind of known touristy destination preferably when traveling and not in your home location i have used many pictures from this one my favorite being with wild donkeys on route in oatman arizona the group picture just make sure you have a picture of you in a group setting it doesn t really matter where when how or what just make sure you look presentable bonus points if you have attractive women in the picture but its not a requirement a picture with your bros or family is just as good the shirtless picture you knew it was coming only put this one in if you can pull it off by pull it off i mean body fat percentages low enough to where you can see pack abs vein vascularity and muscle definition if not don t bother it won t work if you don t have the definition i don t care how big your arms are its probably mostly tricep blubber anyway it also has to be candid no mirror selfies or gym selfies the situation and scenario of the picture has to make way for plausible deniability the shirtless picture i currently use is one of me docking a boat at a marina yes i purposely planned the picture but women who see it won t know that they will just think someone took a picture of me while i was docking a boat on full display is my muscle definition washboard abs and vein vascularity it also helps if you are tanned and not pale i did a self tan the night before this picture if you can t pull off the shirtless picture just try to find another good outdoors action or travel picture to use for lead off with the best non smiling picture of the bunch that isn t the group or shirtless picture i lead with my oatman donkey picture how to get good pictures getting good pictures is harder than it sounds it presents logistical and technological obstacles putting yourself in social situations where others are taking pictures can work but even then you will still need to be able to take some pictures yourself myself i own a drone this allows me to get good shots outside from all kinds of angles my boat docking shirtless picture and hiking pictures would not be possible without it i also used my gopro for my cliff jumping picture but for those of you who don t want to spend a couple hundred on a good drone dji spark is a good option for or action camera you can use your phone and buy a cheap tripod for it then a selfie stick with a remote control so you can take pictures remotely editing your pictures is fine but if you can tell the picture has been edited its overdone it s fine to edit post process your photos but keep it subtle and realistic don t apply a million different filters and effects color correction is fine don t use face softeners for the shirtless picture it may not be a bad idea to up the texture contrast and clarity to make your abs show better and look more shredded overall i can hear it already muh thats a lot of time and investment for pictures on a dating app where sluts only care about validation and the top of men muh fuck off with that shit dick sucker by choice like everything else in life your results are the outcome of what you put into it if you don t think its worth all this trouble fine but realize that you are just going to be behind those who either put more effort in or are naturally more gifted than you i am not saying you can t get good photos without investing in equipment it just makes it easier it is perfectly attainable to get good photos with just your phone the bio most girls don t read it unless they have already matched you or are thinking of matching you if your profile is good enough they ll swipe right on you without reading the profile then they will read it later if they are on the fence it will be a possible deal breaker here is my stance on bios they can not help you at all they can only hurt it s similar to the concept of texting outside of logistics nowhere to go but down so keep it short and factual keep the jokes and essays and other garbage out too many men out there write fucking essays and you will see this if you scout no one is going to read that shit and it makes you look too thirsty two options i like to use one is just a straight quick bio if you are over feet tall put it in there put your location and a couple of words example east side looking for adventures that s it option is a straight quick quote or saying whether it be a song lyric or excerpt from a book or something as long as its short and sweet its fine example don t use this its purely an example there s heroes and there s legends heroes get remembered but legends never die elo score tinder has a built in elo score that is hidden to users it s basically a power ranking of your profile the higher your score the more other high score users will see you and vice versa this is why having great pictures and a good profile is vital you only can help your elo score by being swiped right by others but there are ways you can tank your elo score for reasons other than not being swiped one of which do not overswipe limit the number of swipes either direction you do per day this is for several reasons a big one is if you swipe too much tinder will think you are a bot and shadow ban your profile you ll be seen by no one and you have to wait several days if not more until it reverses at the same time you still have to swipe some in order to be seen by others and calibrate your elo score i think per day is a good number to settle on but space it out no more than a dozen in any given session i ve had my accounts shadowbanned too many times for overswiping why i think tinder gold is still a good investment i am not a tinder employee or shill nor am i someone trying to get you to buy it here is why tinder gold works for me because you can see who has already swiped right on you meaning you don t have to worry about overswiping yes of your like queue will be garbage but its still a good way to see who is active you know which girls are active on tinder and not dormant because you can get the ball rolling on your time table timing plays a key role in these dating apps so being able to dictate the flow and when things start is a bigger deal than you think it is the geography feature is good if you travel a lot so you can scope out women and have things lined up before you even get to your destination the extra super likes and free boost is fine but those are my key features boosting best done tuesday or wednesday nights from my experience around pm this is when girls are really open because they are looking for weekend plans if they don t have any already if you have tinder gold you ll get a shitload of mostly low value likes and its fun to watch them roll in by the gross super likes mixed results for me it gets you matches and puts your profile infront of her but sometimes she will accept your superlike out of pity and you ll be shit tested multiple times harder because the notion of a super like comes across as a bit thirsty be prepared to follow up a super like match with absolute rock solid frame or she isn t going to meet up with you another reason why the tinder gold like queue is helpful because you can find girls who have already liked you save the super likes for situations where you absolutely want her attention it s a gamble what to do when you have matched there are two ways to match one is where she matches you after you have already matched her two is where you match her after she has already matched you regardless of how it works you don t want to appear thirsty thirsty guys will message her as soon as the match hits at the same time you have a small window the clock is ticking and you are competing against other guys for her attention i usually give it a couple hours this way you give her a window for the chance of her message you it will happen occassionally if your profile is good enough and have enough time pass not to appear thirsty but quick enough to where she hasn t had enough time to be swept away by another dude this is also another reason why i prefer tinder gold and matching with girls out of the like queue this way you can make everything on your time table it s best to match girls sunday wednesday that is when they are open and looking she already has plans thursday saturday also its best to match with her in the late afternoon or night not the morning this way you can get the ball rolling at the right times it puts you in a squeeze when she matches with you at am and you are asleep vetting before moving onto an opener i always do as much vetting of the match as i can this way if she is catfishing me or isn t who she says she is i know before wasting any time at all on her it shouldn t be too hard to find her facebook instagram etc utilize her social media pages to make sure she has no red flags or isn t using year old pictures or isn t actually a fat landwhale don t tell the girls you did this its creepy it is creepy but its necessary and girls do it to us i ve had several matches tell me they looked up info about me online before meeting also reverse google image search is your friend it should be easy to spot fake profiles and bots but every now and then some fake profiles look legit reverse google image search if you aren t sure openers i think guys put too much thought into openers and too many guys try to follow some kind of structured script for every match what i ve learned from my experience is every girl is different every match is different it s too organic of a process and what works on one girl won t work on another it s something you have to develop kind of a gut instinct for witty funny pun openers work on some and not others one thing for sure is that they don t work on girls you have super liked because you already have one beta strike against you for super liking going the pun witty funny route is strike others being firm and direct works well remember what i said early on the douche assumption all women automatically will assume you are a creepy douche it s up to you to break that assumption my openers are one of three approaches approach i usually like to open by referencing something in her pictures or profile for example a girl i matched who was from omaha my opener i always have a good time in omaha another example is complimenting one of her clothing choices this isn t beta validation if its done as an opener its an ice breaker it s only beta validation when done later on and multiple times but women love being complimented by strangers as an ice breaker approach is using a gif approach is being direct with just saying her name or hi or what s up but that is rare not saying it doesn t work but i go with that direction if i have nothing for approach or openers are not as important as people make them out to be but that is not saying they aren t important she has already made the decision in her mind if she will fuck you based on your profile and pictures now its on you to prove to her you aren t a creepy douche in order to actually meet up with you the opener and ensuing conversation is about making her comfortable with the idea of meeting you the ensuing conversation again the idea here is not to win her over she has already made up her mind whether or not she wants to fuck you if she wants to fuck you you ve already done that with your profile and pictures if not there is nothing you can do or say to change that fact the idea here is to make her comfortable with meeting up with you i will keep repeating the maxim she automatically assumes you are a douche creep until you prove otherwise that s the idea of the ensuing conversation your goal is to make her comfortable with the idea of meeting up with you and or giving you her number in as short of a conversation as possible some girls this will only take a few messages others might need a bit more time and rapport again its an organic process how badly you want the girl should determine how much time and effort you are willing to put in not saying be ultra thirsty for the best ones but if a wants a lot of rapport its probably not worth it where as a or would be worth the effort of a rapport build i am not saying that sexual innuendo or sexually charged conversation will automatically put you in creep douche territory but your smv has to be high and you have to be extremely smooth with it it s a very fine line if you insist on being sexual in your conversation its best to be direct about it and just make your intentions known instead of try to sugar coat it and beat around the bush regardless your goal should be to get off the tinder app as soon as possible find an opening to get her number and take it to text knowing the right time to ask for her number is more of a feel thing that you have intuition for there is no magic number of back and forth messages you need before you ask for it nor is there a hard ceiling of messages that you have to ask for her number if you hit that point if she needs more rapport you can do it over text instead of in the tinder app but from my experience a phone number is usually good enough to start pushing for logistics less is more like with texting outside of logistics you should be very careful in how much you divulge about yourself when communicating with your matches try to reveal as little about yourself as possible you can not make her more attracted to you by what you say you can only hurt yourself goal is to get her number goal is to push for logistics do not lose sight of either of those goals you might need to divulge some info about yourself to accomplish both goals but be very mindful once you have immediately push for if she wants more time fine but ration it and keep it to a minimum and re push for again once you have the logistics set up keep all contact to a minimum until you meet up preferably go no contact ignore her if you have to shit or get off the pot another thing to keep in mind is that a lot of girls will never be comfortable with the idea of going out with or meeting up with a guy they met on dating apps there will always be a stigma attached to it and while they download the app thinking they are open to the concept when it actually comes time to shit or get off the pot they will chicken out for example she downloads the app and is open to the possibilities she matches with a guy and is open to the possibilities they talk a bit and she is open to the possibilities he asks for her number or asks her to meet up then she freezes it has become real in her mind she was open to the idea but in reality she isn t it s similar to someone saying they will go on a big roller coaster but when they actually get in line and get up to the car to get on the ride they chicken out this will happen just move on and if she comes around eventually great the flake flaking will happen in all stages flaking will happen after the first message after you get her number after you try to arrange a meetup after you have arranged a meet up get used to it don t get butthurt about it if you do it shows you are too invested in a tinder match you have never even fucking met move on like i said women are fickle and in their mind they might be open to meeting up with a guy on tinder or giving him her phone number but when it actually comes time to do it she flakes it s not you it s them do not get too invested into your matches this goes for women in general but for fucks sake especially don t do it with tinder matches it s for this reason i laugh when i hear guys on asktrp talking about running dread or soft nexting their tinder matches none of that is possible until you have stuck your penis inside of her yes tactics like ignoring her taking a long time to reply to her messages and obeying the rule will help but you re wrong if you think you have her wrapped around your finger before you have ever met her you don t when age gap matters in general age gap doesn t matter when a woman finds a man attractive she doesn t give a shit about his age or hamsters it away into a positive plausible deniability also plays a role if she doesn t know his age she will hamster him to be younger than he probably is but with online dating that s not the case remember the creep and douche assumption she is automatically assuming all men on these apps are either creeps douches or both she may swipe right on men in which there is a significant age gap but when they actually match and he actually starts talking to her the creep or douche alarm starts to go off and its up to him to prove he is not there is also no plausible deniability since your age is right there on display her hamster won t work even if you are attractive i am not saying its impossible to succeed when there is an age gap i have many times but the bar you have to clear is a lot higher when it comes to breaking down the creep douche assumption shield the best way to approach an age gap higher than half your age is bare minimum investment match escalate get the meetup or move on you and dozens of others keep in mind that you are not the only guy competing for the attention of your matches the more attractive she is the more guys she has competing for her time and attention in order to meet up with her you have to become her top option a lot of times this just won t happen and she will flake away deal with it this is why i recommend striking while the iron is hot and not wasting any time escalate to getting her number and arranging a meet up as soon as you can do not think its wise to slowly move the conversation toward meeting up or taking your time to get to know her or not wanting to move too fast if you don t move fast another guy will and she will likely ghost you when you get ghosted or flaked on its almost always because another guy how dumb will you feel that you wasted all that time and it didn t work out remember its a tinder match she has no emotional investment or attachment into you at all she just sees you as an option until you meet up with her too many guys delude themselves into thinking that because you matched she has investment in you she doesn t that s how women are as long as she is just a tinder match you have no leverage your power plays aren t going to work yet where to meet up i always meet up at a bar usually an open one with a patio where we can have space do not go to a sit down restaurant if you strike it off then you can take it somewhere else but a bar is a good relaxed setting to vet her and see if she is who she is in person bumble vs tinder both apps have their strengths and weaknesses tinder is generally better for hookups or flings the userbase skews younger is the hot zone and the userbase does not take it as seriously a big pond with a lot of fish that aren t as interested in biting there is more of a stigma attached to using this app bumble is better for something more than a hookup you will have more success in terms of on bumble but not as many overall number of matches the problem is that the userbase is smaller and more inactive it s a smaller pond with less fish but the fish are more interested in biting the active userbase will be a lot more serious also it skews older which can be good or bad you ll get more mature women in terms of behavior and not immature year olds but they are older is the hot zone less of a stigma with this app it has been accepted as something not to be ashamed of given the i prefer bumble simply because there are less games the women who are active on there aren t going to mess around generally women you match with will be open to meeting up and won t waste your time the issue is that you can run through the stack of active women rather quickly and it then becomes a waiting game for new women to start using the app this isn t saying tinder doesn t have its advantages both are good apps but fill slightly different niches tinder is a numbers game tinder is a shotgun bumble is a sniper rifle i do not recommend the bee line bumble s version of tinder gold because there just aren t enough active women on there to justify it restarting profiles people say its best to delete your profile and remake it because tinder and bumble automatically boost new users to the top of other s stacks for a couple of days i ve tested it myself to mixed results and no one seems to know for sure i would say in my testing restarting a profile would backfire more than it would help i think tinder and bumble both have ways of knowing if you are a retread or not more often than not i would remake profiles and be seen by no one i d get no matches at the very least you will know you are getting matches because even if you aren t a tinder gold beeline subscriber you will see those liked you queue numbers go up anyway but if it stays stuck at the same number even if your preferences are a wide net you re invisible i advise against restarting your profile too much if you must do it i recommend going dark for at least days if not longer i ve heard rumblings that your data is discarded and they forget you after days but who knows these days data is valuable and i am skeptical of these companies discarding it some say all you need is a burner phone number or facebook account but i swear i think that these companies can track ip or facial recognition in photos because despite using a new phone and such they still seemed to shadowban me during my tests do not use a burner facebook for your serious account the problem is that burner facebook accounts if flagged can be treated like a spam bot which will not only lock you out of your facebook but your tinder bumble accounts as well this has happened to me before and i wasted money on my tinder gold subscription due to it use one for a scouting account but not your main account the best way to do it is to make sure you have all your ducks in a row and shit together pictures bio etc before launching your tinder bumble profiles conclusion tinder and bumble and other apps like these are weapons any red pilled man needs to have in his arsenal there is no negative or downside to having them and you have nothing but upside it s a great way to run passive game to supplement your in person game it helps you cultivate abundance and raise your n count even if you only fuck girl on these apps every months that s still additional notches per year that you gained through minimal investment it adds up anyone who shits on these apps or say they are a waste of time is an incel mgtow retard who sucks dick by choice
15646,i can t think of a topic where more snake oil gets peddled so i d like to offer you a straight forward way of understanding the fundamentals of what women find attractive amp x b i m writing from a man s perspective but if you re a woman stick around this will be useful when talking with your man about what you find sexually attractive amp x b along the way i m going to oversimplify generalize embrace gender stereotypes and heterosexual examples if you re cool with that let s go amp x b here s what is attractive to women sex therapist esther perel famously asks women this question in her live seminars amp x b what s one thing that your man could do to make you more attracted and open to sex amp x b can you guess what the most common answer is amp x b help with the dishes amp x b if that makes no sense to you i feel your pain so you re not alone amp x b i recently explained this phenomenon one of my newsletters the next day i received this upset message from a guy named max amp x b bruce there are studies that show that the more men help with the housework the less their wives are attracted to them amp x b women are attracted to a masculine man who is somewhat dominant and decisive in his mannerisms somewhat mysterious and uncommunicative amp x b if you are a male girlfriend to your partner or too much of an understanding roommate you will get less sex from her amp x b reading ideas like this leaves many of us especially men feeling confused and inadequate amp x b what if we re not naturally dominant or mysterious or stoic are we supposed to fake it amp x b to understand what women find attractive in a man we first need to first make some assumptions amp x b assumption you re in a long term relationship with a mature woman a year old woman will be sexually attracted to different qualities than an year old girl will amp x b also the rules of the attraction game are vastly different depending on which relationship stage your relationship is in amp x b here we re talking about how to stay sexually attractive in the eyes of your long term partner amp x b assumption your partner s attachment style influences what they find sexy here s the deal you can be securely attached or insecurely attached amp x b securely attached means that you feel good about depending on your partner emotionally and having them depend on you insecurely attached means that you don t feel good about depending on your partner emotionally and having them depend on you there s a lot more to it than that but for the sake of preventing information overload we ll save it for another time what s important is that you know which you are amp x b if you re reading this you re almost certainly insecurely attached so is your partner amp x b that s not a judgement or a curse it s just a statistical probability hey i m insecurely attached too so you re in good company amp x b depending on your attachment style you ll be attracted by very different things amp x b whereas securely attached partners are drawn to have sex by the desire for intimacy insecurely attached couples are commonly drawn to sex by the desire to reduce their anxiety or fear amp x b you may not immediately recognize your anxiety or fear but that s ok stick with me amp x b attraction and sex drive decoded i have a high sex drive commonly turns out to be code for i feel insecure about me or us and i need sex often so that i can soothe myself and feel better amp x b i have a low sex drive commonly turns out to be code for i don t feel safe enough to be that vulnerable with you or i resent you and don t want to be that close with someone that i feel has hurt me and whom i can t trust won t hurt me again amp x b notice how neither of those have anything to do with intimacy amp x b assumption sexual attraction is sparked by two opposing forces within each of us just like an electrical circuit has both positive charge and negative charge let s pretend that everyone has two opposing forces inside of them me and we amp x b me traits me myself i autonomous analytical protective initiates leads amp x b we traits family community collaborative nurturing generous responds follows amp x b me traits are often considered masculine traits we traits are often considered feminine traits i don t like to use these terms because it s dangerously easy to confuse them with male and female me and we is simpler amp x b what is attractive to women me and we we all have both me and we traits in differing amounts amp x b alright with those assumptions out of the way let s do this amp x b do women really find dominant men attractive rp common knowledge women are attracted to a masculine man who is somewhat dominant and decisive in his mannerisms somewhat mysterious and uncommunicative amp x b dominant decisive mysterious uncommunicative amp x b phew that s a lot to live up to but there s some truth to this amp x b it s true that many women find confidence and mystery attractive traits in a man amp x b each of those is a me trait me traits signal autonomy and autonomy is sexy for reasons we ll cover another time amp x b however the idea that dominance is attractive is horribly oversimplified amp x b many men myself included have mistakenly concluded that we need to be dominant decisive mysterious and uncommunicative all the time or risk losing our woman s respect that s really hard to do amp x b there s a name for people who are dominant all the time they re called bullies amp x b most women aren t attracted to bullies amp x b try being mysterious and uncommunicative me traits when your partner is hurt and needs you to empathize and listen she ll erect even higher walls around her heart to protect it from your insensitivity amp x b then the last thing she ll feel like doing is making love with you amp x b the only person i can think of who meets the criteria for being dominant decisive mysterious and uncommunicative all the time is james bond amp x b the epitome of attractive daniel craig bond james bond amp x b most women would agree that james bond is a damn fine specimen of a sexy man amp x b i m pretty sure that there are millions of women who would be tickled pink at the thought of sharing some time between the sheets with such a confident autonomous and mysterious man amp x b i mean he s james bond right he s the poster boy for autonomy amp x b but if i asked those same women if they d want to spend the rest of their lives with james bond i m pretty certain that i d hear a resounding no thanks amp x b why amp x b because james bond is a man who can t commit he s incapable of intimacy he won t talk about his feelings and he d never help out with the dishes amp x b said another way james bond has massively under developed we traits as a result amp x b a man like james bond is good for only two things saving the world and a one night stand amp x b a man like james bond is good for only things saving the world and a one night stand amp x b amp x b do women really find nice guys unattractive we men have been indoctrinated to believe that nice guys don t get the girl amp x b not wanting to be jerks either many of us feel stuck between a rock and a hard place unsure of who to be and how to behave with our woman amp x b our uncertainty isn t attractive and so she rejects our sexual advances this perpetuates our belief that we need to be someone other than who we are to spark her sexual interest amp x b so we resolve to be more like who we think she wants us to be this in authenticity isn t exactly attractive either and so she rejects our sexual advances again amp x b and round and round we go stuck in a vicious cycle each one a little bit worse than the last amp x b until we resolve to banish our nice guy personality amp x b the game what pickup artists think women find attractive instead having read in some dating book that women find this behavior attractive we try to act like an alpha male amp x b those same dating books tell men not to be too needy available or emotional basically to not be human crazy huh amp x b so faking disinterest and emotional unavailability we end up coming across as a jerk instead amp x b being a jerk isn t attractive and so she rejects our sexual advances again amp x b until we end up in a sexless marriage having an affair or getting divorced amp x b all this because some relationship guru told us that women don t like nice guys amp x b phew amp x b so let s set the record straight once and for all amp x b most women aren t attracted to wimps but they aren t attracted to jerks either amp x b there s nothing wrong with being a nice guy a decent guy a considerate guy a thoughtful guy or a caring guy amp x b in fact if you can t express those traits no self respecting woman will want to be intimate with you amp x b so let s not use the term nice guy it s misleading i ve got some new terms for us instead amp x b the new archetypes of attraction the integrated man woman amp x b a person with developed me traits and developed we traits they are autonomous and play well in a team they re powerfully masculine and powerfully feminine and can choose to express more or less of either depending on which is appropriate in the moment amp x b the wimp male formerly known as the nice guy or the pushover female amp x b a person with underdeveloped me traits they tend to not have a clear sense of direction in life and often come across as passive and needing to please they re trying extra hard to not be too masculine amp x b the jerk male or the hard ass female amp x b a person with underdeveloped we traits they tend to be self centered pushy and dominant without much empathy for others they re trying extra hard to not be too feminine amp x b note these descriptions are the extremes of each archetype you might recognize yourself and your partner somewhere in the middle amp x b what women find attractive is an integrated man amp x b we wimps jerks pushovers and hard asses are not bad people we re usually very loving caring people but we haven t yet developed our me and we traits amp x b never again moments most of us have suffered a never again moment a moment where we experienced being badly hurt or betrayed by someone close to us and having little or no support to help us heal our hurt amp x b after a never again moment amp x b wimps and pushovers often make a promise to themselves that they will never be like the person who dominated them in doing so they deny their dominance a me trait jerks and hard asses often decide that they will never again be dominated in doing so they deny their vulnerability a we trait amp x b amp x b attachment style influences what you re attracted to to add to this sea of complexity our attachment style also influences our partner choice amp x b insecurely attached people tend to fall in love with other insecurely attached people amp x b so when we meet a securely attached integrated man or woman we ll commonly break up with them pretty early on but they re likely to be the very person who can give us the partnership that we so want amp x b why would we leave a person who can give us what we want because amp x b the consistent emotional availability and stability that an integrated man woman provides doesn t feel like love to us amp x b it feels unfamiliar foreign we re not expecting it or looking for it because we never received it as a child amp x b i love you but i m not in love with you the amount of emotional support we received as children can determine what we are attracted to as adults imagine for example that you grew up in a home where both of your parents worked all day they weren t available when you needed them to help you through difficult emotional times because they were working amp x b you d grow up having little experience of what emotional support feels like amp x b you loved your parents and they loved you too but you grew up with a model of love that didn t include consistent emotional support during tough times amp x b i m emphasizing the word consistent because as children what makes us feel safe is knowing that our parents will always be available emotionally responsive and supportive when we are in distress amp x b fast forward years and you begin dating someone really secure you fall in love they want to support you but you re weirded out by their emotional availability it feels icky to you amp x b eventually you end it saying amp x b i love you but i m not in love with you can we still be friends amp x b that phrase is code for i care for you but i feel no sexual attraction towards you i want to find someone that makes my heart pound and feel alive amp x b if we were more self aware we might admit to this instead amp x b your emotional support doesn t feel like love to me i learned from my parents that love feels like the lack of emotional support amp x b so i m breaking up with you so i can find someone less secure and boring than you are amp x b i don t feel comfortable being so stable i want someone who isn t so emotionally available so i can feel my heart pounding and know that i m in love amp x b but what insecurely attached people never come to realize is amp x b that heart pounding in love feeling isn t love it s fear amp x b love and fear feel similar if you pay attention when you re falling in love you ll notice that the feeling of being in love has many of the same characteristics as anxiety amp x b your heart beats faster your palms get clammy you obsess over one thing your mate you can t concentrate or focus for too long you ll do things you d never ordinarily do to get their attention when we find someone attractive our heart pounds this pounding is often fear not love amp x b that heart pounding in love feeling isn t love it s fear amp x b securely attached people report feeling love in a gentler way than insecurely attached people their hearts do beat faster but it s not that desperate kind of thump thump thump secure love is often a quieter more grounded some might even say boring experience amp x b but secure love lasts amp x b there s an overwhelming amount of evidence that suggests amp x b securely attached people are happier are healthier and can live up to years longer amp x b the good news is that anyone can learn to become securely attached and integrate their me and we traits that s what my work is all about amp x b what women find attractive in a man over the years that i ve been helping couples i ve heard thousands of men and women talk about the intimate details of their marriages and sex lives i ve been able to collect a lot of data points amp x b in my experience what most women consider sexy is a man who displays slightly more me traits and slightly less we traits than she has amp x b that word slightly is important amp x b try being too wimpy or too dominant with an integrated woman and she ll toss you to the curb amp x b when my clients talk about what their husband could do to be more attractive they almost always say something like this amp x b i want him to take the lead be protective if necessary but also be vulnerable honest and supportive amp x b are attractive integrated men unicorns isn t she describing a unicorn amp x b nope she s describing an integrated man amp x b these men are neither mysterious nor uncommunicative amp x b they re not overly dependent nor overly independent amp x b but they re strong kind open emotionally transparent and comfortable with being vulnerable e g expressing sadness fear hurt amp x b they don t project their feelings onto their partner e g it s because of you that i feel bad they re willing to be supportive and they expect their partner to be there and support them too amp x b you feel calm and safe being around them amp x b which is why the integrated men seems like a unicorn to most insecurely attached women amp x b most of them are already taken in stable marriages and have no plans to divorce amp x b if you re a man and you re feeling a little overwhelmed thinking how do i ever live up to that that s ok we all have to begin somewhere on our journey towards integration and maturity what s important is that you begin amp x b but where to begin amp x b what securely attached looks like because most of us insecurely attached folks didn t exactly have great role models when it came to love we ve never been shown what a securely attached relationship looks like and feels like amp x b so i d like to give you a sense of what a securely attached relationship feels like by offering you this metaphor amp x b partner dancing together sparks attraction amp x b when a couple with integrated me and we traits come together it can look a lot like partner dancing in partner dancing one partner leads and one partner follows amp x b this video will help you understand better than my words ever can amp x b beautiful right and it s damn sexy amp x b the man is leading a me trait but not dominating the woman is following a we trait but not like a pushover she follows powerfully amp x b that s what a mature securely attached relationship feels like in the bedroom and out in the world amp x b however for insecurely attached couples the dance of attraction doesn t always look as graceful it looks like a lot more pushing and pulling and standing on each other s toes amp x b and that s ok because partner dancing can be learned some of us learned as children by watching our parents but for the rest of us we have to find a teacher amp x b if you re interested in learning how to partner gracefully together i teach that here amp x b the final word on attraction and housework max wrote and over time the more men help with the housework the less their wives are turned on amp x b do women find washing the dishes attractive i haven t read the research max quoted but i suspect that the findings are a little more nuanced amp x b could being a good guy really strip you of your desirability in your mate s eyes and make you unattractive to women amp x b obviously not amp x b helping out with the dishes demonstrates partnership collaboration and caring all we traits amp x b the lack of me traits is what is not attractive to women not the presence of we traits amp x b and there s no way any researcher could ever correlate washing the dishes with a spouse s waning sexual desire amp x b firstly these couples were not in a controlled environment secondly there are a million other variables like age culture health menopause hormone levels etc that could be influencing her sexual desire perhaps it s a chemical in the dishwashing soap that zaps sexual desire in women amp x b did they test that i doubt it amp x b the best that researchers can do is thumb suck their conclusions amp x b while writing this i got side tracked and designed a dish washing liquid label i think it s funny amp x b can washing the dishes make your wife more attracted to you amp x b what turns all women off in her fantastic book hold me tight dr sue johnson shares research that shows that when men and women were presented with sexually explicit images while being hooked up to brain scanning equipment both sexes were equally aroused amp x b pre frontal cortex stops sexual desire amp x b however the women s brains lit up in an area that did not light up in the men s brains the prefrontal cortex this area of the brain is concerned with control and judgment amp x b the researchers concluded that in response to a sexual cue all women are preoccupied with safety at the same time amp x b not so in men amp x b so to all you men reading this if your woman doesn t feel safe around you you re not getting any nookie tonight amp

15863,a complete guide to picking up model tier girls today i want to tell you everything i know about getting the highest calibre girls from cold approach this guide will cover frame control inner game and passing tests which i consider to be the holy trinity of and game this guide will not cover body language pulling or handling logistics obviously the latter are extremely important but they ve been adequately covered elsewhere and there just isn t space to include them here my background picked on in school small and sickly didn t have a girlfriend until was dumped by her and spent the first years of college pretty much celibate got into redpill ideas through the old citizen renegade blog which is now heartiste from there stumbled on rsd s infield videos started going out and approaching regularly approach anxiety and ceaseless rejection for months but i kept at it the odd success here and there after about years i was fucking a new girl every fortnight or so mostly s and s with the occasional turbo when fortune smiled on me my current girlfriend is a has done modelling etc below is everything i know about getting the hottest women from cold approach pickup this is specially engineered for getting s and s and dealing with the kind of bullshit these girls will inevitably give you if you re more into sleeping with tons of s and there s nothing wrong with that this might be overkill when i was single i personally was one of those guys who would rather fuck half a dozen s s in a year than mid range girls so my whole approach to game is based on optimizing for that take it for what it is i m not saying my approach is better this is just how i roll based on my preferences this is a long post you may want to bookmark it and return to it later if you re particularly concerned with getting the hottest girls there s a lot of subtle points in here that won t be immediately clear on a first reading part the attraction process women are attracted to you because you have a stronger frame than they do that s all there s nothing else to it attraction is purely a function of the fact that you re a man you have a stronger frame than the girlas a man you naturally have a strong frame of reality whereas women don t therefore they value that having a strong frame is a result of high testosterone levels women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame than a handsome guy with a weak one evolution has designed women to be very flexible in terms of who they ll become attracted to women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame i e a natural leader than a handsome guy with a weak frame cowardice uncertainty that s because women who chose to fuck the latter ultimately had their genes rooted out of existence by the brutal conditions of ancestral life in consequence women now are very adaptable they have the capacity to be attracted to almost any man so long as his frame is stronger than hers a girl can only get horny for you if you have a stronger frame than her think of this like a mathematical equation there s no getting around it no cheating it no short circuiting it it is an immutable law women want to submit to you they want to submit to a strong man but she can t submit to you if your frame is weaker than hers physiologically girls can t even become wet for a guy who has a weaker frame than they do it s literally impossible be a man act like you have answers bill burr what is a strong frame fundamentally it s a sense of certainty in everything you do this certainty manifests itself as calmness in the face of social pressure simply put in a cold approach pickup the woman becomes attracted to you because you re more relaxed than she is that s all that might seem strange but it s actually not the very fact that you approached the girl at all demonstrates a massive amount of confidence and social value either real or potential so once you ve approached the girl and gotten her into a conversation the game is yours to lose she ll inevitably become attracted to you because you re a man and because you have a stronger frame than she does relax you will approach women and you will make mistakes that s fine women don t want you to be perfect they only want you to be a man you are not physically perfect neither am i neither is anyone women are not looking for perfection they re only looking for a man who has a stronger psychological frame than they do and fortunately for you you already have a naturally stronger frame than women an example of this is how women will freak out over spiders or mice jump up and down scream and so on whereas a man will calmly deal with the situation without it breaking his frame she tests your frame to test your masculinity the two are the exact same thing women are attracted to masculinity and masculinity can be defined as a measure of how much pressure a man can endure without it breaking his frame when you approach a hot woman she immediately starts trying to break down your frame she s testing it for strength if your frame crumbles in the face of her frame she knows you re not a man because men have a stronger frame than women fortunately your frame will not crumble a girl s frame will always buckle under yours after you pass several of her tests it s instinctual women want to be with the strong man when she sees you have a strong frame she starts getting wet listen smile nod agree then do what the fuck you were gonna do anyway robert downey jr women test me all the time women have said things to me that are totally brutal called me ugly too short a loser etc most of the women i approach will make a weird face or pretend to ignore me for the first seconds it doesn t penetrate it doesn t cause any emotional reaction whatsoever inside me i smile nod agree and then keep talking to her as if she s being nice to me eventually she starts responding then she starts laughing and then we have sex a woman s frame will always buckle under yours it s not a question of if but when chasing hot girls gives you a charge when you re first getting into game it s fine to only approach s and s many of these girls will be super nice to you and that s cool a lot of them are fantastic in bed but once you start to get some experience you re naturally going to want to move up the ladder and start laying s s and s this is a natural instinct and it s good it s okay to chase girls just because they re hot these girls want you to chase them if they didn t they wouldn t make themselves hot part of being a man is that you can appreciate a woman s beauty and femininity it gives you a charge and pursuing women who are out of your league by society s false standards also gives you a charge seducing a is no different from seducing a the process of attraction is exactly the same the only difference is that the hot girl s frame is stronger than the chubby girl s but ultimately no matter how strong a hottie s frame is your frame will always be stronger because you re a man women will test you brutally when they want to sleep with you when you approach any hot girl she ll test your frame hard to see if it s strong she ll act like a bitch she ll pretend to ignore you she ll tell you outright to go away she wants to see if you ll buckle to social pressure or if your frame will remain calm and consistent regardless of external feedback she actually wants to sleep with you but she needs to test your strength first don t be fooled by the bitch persona for a second it s a carefully cultivated test most men fail the test because they don t even realize they re being tested fight club analogy getting a hot woman into bed is like the hazing scene in fight club where the new recruits are lined up outside the door tyler berates the recruits with personal insults too old go away too fat go away he forces them to stand outside for days he tells them there s no possibility they re getting in most give up but the few who stay are ultimately invited inside seducing the hottest women is the same it s a war of attrition women will fuck pretty much any guy who s around at the end of the night so long as he has a stronger frame than she does but you have to stick around you can t leave when she insults you or acts like she doesn t want to talk to you if you do you re failing her tests we ll get into the mechanics of passing these tests in a moment first we need to talk about inner game which is the basis of out framing anyone part inner game the battle is won or lost inside you before it s ever fought we ve said that the only way to arouse a woman to the point that she wants to sleep with you off cold approach is to pass her tests how do you pass these tests the first principle is to understand is that all tests are frame tests the entire purpose of tests is to see if you have a strong frame that won t buckle under pressure therefore it s useless begin with talking about how to pass tests the real value is in having a strong frame to begin with as sun tzu says in the art of war every battle is won or lost before it s ever fought the i am enough frame the gold dust that gets you s and s the basis of your inner game is the idea that you are enough in other words you have value to women simply because you re a man everything else is built upon that foundation you don t have to do anything to attract a girl she s attracted to you simply because you re more relaxed than she is you don t have to change anything you don t have to improve your game beyond what it s at now you don t need to become better looking you can do all these things if you want and they will help you but you don t have to you re already good enough simply because you re a man because you ve got testosterone and a dick women value that men and women are meant to get together we fit together like a key and a lock there have been studies done in which women smell men s sweaty t shirts and it changes the chemistry of their brain making them more relaxed and calm your male ness is inherently attractive to women same way as their femininity is inherently attractive to you standards are a myth everyone is a horny scoundrel we have been brainwashed in our culture into believing that people women have something called standards women don t have any standards not really neither do men imagine you re naked in bed with a she s kinda chubby plain face you probably wouldn t be proud of the lay whatever but her skin s soft she smells good and she s naked and wet are you going to say no probably not if we re being honest with each other you d almost definitely fuck her if you could be certain that a she d leave afterwards and b no one would find out there s a natural magnetism between men and women we have no willpower around each other women are the same way take it from someone who s shot out of his league too many times to count be her cheat meal you can be a and she can be a if the circumstances are right she ll fuck you so long as there s no downside why because sex feels good even the hottest slimmest yoga bunny pigs out on pizza every once in a while it s human nature we re not strong we re weak we pretend to have standards to the outside world but down deep inside no one has any standards and we know it we have no will no self control hot women are the same if you can hold frame pass a woman s test and lead her to somewhere sex can happen while creating plausible deniability she will fuck you you d be amazed how easy it is when you get it down stop thinking you need to be an alpha to get hot girls helpful at first but it will ultimately stress you out your frame is i am enough your frame is not i m a badass alpha who s better than everyone that s hard to uphold in the face of conflicting evidence and will cause cognitive dissonance and stress it simply women and men are meant to get together i m a man therefore women are already attracted to me on some baseline level that s not a hard frame to maintain it doesn t stretch the truth it doesn t cause cognitive dissonance and therefore it s much more resilient in the face of tests and resistance which is the most critical element to getting the hottest girls cultivate a reality distortion field in order to do this you must fully internalize the i am enough belief system understanding it in theory isn t enough you have to feel it with your whole mass you have to believe it with total unquestioning brainwashed conviction the more you think about the idea that there s no reason you re not enough the more it will feel true things become true to us through repetition not through logic use self hypnosis if necessary find every reason you can to support the belief that you re enough while cultivating deliberate blindness to anything that contradicts it don t be a slave to logic make logic a slave to you this is how you cultivate a reality distortion field part how to make women horny by passing their tests enduring tests building attraction when you approach a woman she immediately starts testing you by passing her tests you demonstrate that your frame is stronger than hers this makes her horny for you women are wired in such a way that they can t become wet for a man unless he s overcome some kind of resistance to get her hence tests actually help you to seduce her you want her to test you the more tests you endure the faster she ll sleep with you when a girl is so into you that she doesn t test you this is how you end up on a rd date with a woman who still won t put out tests are your friend passing tests is where all attraction is ultimately generated attraction is not generated by pickup lines and witty comebacks attraction is not generated by manipulation techniques attraction is not generated by looks or money all of these things will increase your probabilities of getting laid and make your game smoother and more streamlined but they re not what builds attraction the one and only thing that builds attraction is enduring a woman s tests the reason for this is obvious when you think about it enduring her tests ability to overcome adversity good genes women have to see you have a strong frame because otherwise they have no confidence that you ll be able to protect them and remain calm in the face of danger and the only way they can figure out if you have strong frame is by testing you being bitchy insulting you brushing you off ignoring you etc that might seem unfair to you but if you can t handle the abuse from some blonde chick in a bar how the fuck are you going to handle beating a ft tall man to death with your bare hands when he and his tribe invade your village and try to gang rape your girl think about it women aren t built for starbucks they re built for the african savannah women aren t built for the modern world they re built for nature red in tooth and claw if you understand that you ll do things differently you won t take it so personally when you approach a girl and she tries to destroy you it necessary hot women aren t acting bitchy to you because of feminism they re acting bitchy to you because they want to fuck you but they can only do so after they ve proved that you have a stronger frame than they do this is instinctual it s part of the natural order innate female bitchiness existed long before feminism testing men who approach them is encoded into female dna when you get bitter at hot women for testing you you re being just as anti nature as feminists themselves eliminate self destructive beliefs there s a common myth in the seduction community that a girl who acts bitchy to your approach is fundamentally flawed and therefore not worth pursuing this is totally ludicrous in fact it s just an incidence of sour grapes cognitive games we play with ourselves to rationalize that the grapes we can t reach are sour the reality is that if a girl has any value whatsoever then she will test you hard during your first approach embrace tests do you want a woman who says yes to every cock who comes along without putting up the slightest resistance or do you want a woman who actually discriminates among men based on their value and who chose you over hundreds of other suitors because you had the highest value if you re a normal healthy man you want the second woman and that means you must logically expect her to test you hard and to test you with everything she s got and you must not only expect tests but appreciate them you like it when a girl acts bitchy on your approach it means that if you settle down with her she s likely to act bitchy to other guys who approach her scaring them away the higher a woman s value in looks and character the harder she will test you by acting boring and bitchy this is the way it is and will be this way and not some other way luckily passing tests is the fastest way to create arousal and horniness this means that paradoxically the hottest women are often the easiest to seduce if you know how to pass their tests the two categories of tests hot girls will give you and how to pass them women will give you two types of tests active tests and passive tests active tests active tests are covered frequently in pua literature when a woman insults you belittles you mocks you or says something provocative to get a reaction these are all examples of active tests common brush off lines like telling you she has a boyfriend saying you re a nice guy telling you ljbf these are also active tests i won t talk much about passing active tests as this material has already been done to death in the redpill pua world just look up anything on shit tests suffice to say the best way to pass active tests is to either a agree and amplify b ignore the test and continue as if you didn t even hear it generally speaking getting active tests is very good if the girl s actively testing you it means she s definitely interested it s also a very easy way to demonstrate your strength of frame by being a charming asshole in response how to get past her bitch shield persona and into her knickers recognize and endure passive tests but there is another type of test which is much more important to understand this is the passive test this is almost never covered by pua redpill literature yet these tests are actually the most common you ll encounter particularly when dealing with s and s passive testing happens when you approach a girl and she appears to be indifferent bored or aloof resting bitch face is a passive test giving you only one word answers is a passive test and my favorite when you go to approach a hot girl and she looks at you with a face of half disgust half horror and runs away utterly brutal as it seems yes even that is a test don t confuse passive tests with rejection of guys interpret passive tests as rejection even natural alphas do and that s totally understandable i mean it makes sense right if you approach a stunner and she takes one look at you before making a creeped out face to her friend and then they run away that s obviously a rejection right well what if i told you that at least half the women i ve slept with in my life reacted like that or similarly badly when i approached them here s a particularly good example rejection is not rejection there was this girl i went to college with brunette hot did modeling work in her spare time socially was one step down from a minor celebrity in my city probably one of the or hottest girls in my college i always wanted to fuck this girl because she seemed smart and interesting as well as just hot but i rarely saw her around one day she passed me in the stairwell and i thought this is probably the only chance i m ever going to get so i approached her and blurted hi i m mike good eye contact held my hand out to shake hers whatever she looked at me like i had leprosy i mean she literally recoiled her eyes went wide in horror as if i was trying to infect her with aids she shook my hand limply and muttered some social nicety back then ran away swiftly wow now that s a rejection right well the story has an addendum that woman is now my girlfriend has been for three years she ll probably be the mother of my children so what s going on here if she was attracted to me which she later told me she was why did she appear to reject me answering this question is the the key to mastering all of game and social dynamics you ready ok here we go you are too high value yes you read that correctly when you re getting rejected by girls it s because you re too high value for them and it makes them nervous and self conscious stay with me here i know this sounds paradoxical but try to grasp it women are nervous around you when you approach a woman out of the blue it demonstrates a lot of value more than you probably realize this is because of guys don t approach at all those who do are usually drunk and sloppy this means that if you re an average to fair looking guy and you cold approach a girl you ve just put yourself in the top of men in terms of confidence in other words she is going to naturally assume that you are an alpha male whether this is true or not this makes her nervous and self conscious she s ill at ease around you because she wants to make a good impression so she tries to act cool aloof and standoffish because she feels awkward she says bitchy things because she can t think of anything else to say she run aways because she feels anxious around you and doesn t know what to do next in other words you re coming across as too high value women are nervous around you be patient with them dumb yourself down hold frame tease them keep smiling warmly eventually they ll open up and start laughing flirting back and ultimately get turned on by the fact that you out framed them in a way no other man ever has bonus the most common tests hot girls will give you and how to pass them in a way that builds attraction you approach her say hi and she makes a weird face or pretends to ignore you simply keep talking as if you expect her to talk back she s nervous and self conscious and doesn t know what to say that s why she s acting bitchy you re too high value for her and she feels anxious causing her to try to act cool don t react to her keep your body language open and relaxed warm smile unwavering eye contact keep talking eventually she ll start talking back and responding positively you re talking to a girl and she acts indifferent or aloof only gives you one word answers or keeps looking off into the distance again you simply have to endure it keep talking keep being playful teasing her a little bit never hurts either are you this charming with all the guys this bitchy cheerleader persona you re putting on is really turning me on please keep it going when she sees you re not going to go away so easily her frame will crack she ll start to smile attraction you re talking to a girl and she leaves to go to the bathroom says i have to go find my friends or runs away for no apparent reason let her go then re approach her later i can t tell you how many girls have run off on me then i approach them half an hour later and they re like oh it s you and then we hook up why do women leave again they re nervous have you ever approached a hot girl and things were going too well the girl is smiling and laughing she s responding well and you freak out you don t know what else to do but you don t want to fuck it up so you leave set girls do this too women will run out of things to say and run away because they re nervous and overwhelmed by being in a high value person s presence same as guys will let her go then re approach her next time you see her she will respond extremely well of the time in my experience she ll literally be grateful to you that you gave her another chance women have told me this explicitly if you re talking to a girl and she tells you outright that you should leave or says well you should go back to your friends it was nice meeting you etc smile nod agree and then continue talking to her as if she said nothing never leave set because a girl tells you to she can walk away if she wants she has that right but in a public space like a bar or nightclub you re well within your rights to talk to whoever you want it saturday night it s a social environment you re mixing with people you re free to talk to whoever you want and she s free to walk away at any time but if she tells you to leave it s simply a test of your frame she wants to see that you won t buckle under social pressure pass the test by ignoring it if she tells you to leave again look her in the eye with a sly smile and say you re free to go if you want to her eyes will light up and she ll punch you in the arm pussy dampening commences you re talking to a woman and there s an uncomfortably long lull in the conversation stare into her left pupil while saying nothing instant sexual tension you approach a woman or a group of women and they attempt to mock or belittle you they re nervous around you because you re the alpha male in the environment as demonstrated by the fact that you approached they feel uncomfortable in your presence because you re high value and so they re trying to maintain frame by making nervous jokes smile nod agree and keep talking to them as if they were being perfectly nice to you if you act like they re being civil eventually their frame will buckle to yours and they actually will begin to act civil that s the nature of having a stronger frame you create reality other people adjust themselves to it tl dr women value you because you have a stronger frame than them that s all to figure out if you ve got a strong frame women test you these tests come in the form of indifference bitchiness aloofness personal insults etc you don t have to do much to pass these tests you just have to endure them keep talking to her teasing her a little and being normal over time her frame will buckle and she ll become aroused by you because she sees you have a strong frame that can t be pushed around attraction is a passive not an active process you attract hot girls by outframing them you outframe them by enduring their tests without it breaking your frame eventually they buckle to you and become wet laugh at your jokes ask you what you re doing later etc then you can take her hand and lead her to the sex location and she ll be compliant the hotter the woman the harsher will be her tests paradoxically this can actually make hotter women easier to attract because if you can endure her tests you stand out massively from other guys compare to an average girl her tests won t be as hard so you have to pass more of them and spend more time with her before she can see you re strong
15939,do you ever get sucked into a video game or hobby so much that it consumes your entire life and you neglect just about everything else does the world of normal social interaction simply seem puzzling and full of contradictions do you ever find yourself asking wtf is the point of small talk and standing up straight and a firm handshake and all these other meaningless social behaviors do you just not give a fuck about fashion and would rather all people judge you and everyone else on their intelligence or character do you have a really good memory and can remember details from childhood that other people have long forgotten do you have a weird thing going on with your eyes where one eye looks slightly off center compared to the other eye do people say you look stiff and unnatural in your body language if so there s a strong chance you re on the spectrum my background around of the population has autism spectrum disorder and it can lead to an incredibly frustrating experience with women growing up i always had difficulty making friends and staying out of trouble at school every school principal would call my parents and tell them that i was different from the others and should go to a psychiatrist to be checked for autism i ended up being diagnosed with aspergers syndrome a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests based on everything i observed growing up i m sure i got it from my dad as an engineer he exhibits almost all of my symptoms and looking at him i could see the end result of aspergers syndrome if left to grow unchecked into adulthood he had this weird hybrid between having a somewhat alpha vibe with my mom in that he wouldn t tolerate any bullshit and would lose his temper and scream when things don t go his way and this weird beta worldview that a man should be a provider and should look to make as much money as possible and take care of his woman unfortunately in the later stages of his career i realized after my parents divorce that aspergers can lead to serious consequences in career i don t think he ever recognized the importance of workplace politics in any company and always complained about brown nosers and other people getting promoted over him even though he was smarter and more capable it just never occurred to him that the reason he kept getting laid off was not because of his technical ability or not working hard enough but because of his poor eq and difficulty in building relationships with co workers and bosses there would always be a bullshit excuse for why he got fired every time like failed to meet performance expectations or not a team player but deep down i think he always knew that it was because he didn t brown nose or mingle with the other co workers socially looking back now i m incredibly thankful for my dad watching him and how his life turned out gave me the clearest example possible of what happens when you focus only on skills and neglect social development i saw myself going down the exact same path all the way to age getting good grades in high school and college while spending the majority of my time playing wow and league of legends check no friends or social life outside of online gaming of any kind check no girls even looking my direction or giving me any iois check neglecting physical appearance and fashion to the extreme around lbs overweight with horrible acne and wearing clothes my parents bought me check landing a great job in finance after graduation and thinking my life would be set check ironically enough looking back i don t think any of my problems would have been solved if i was born better looking or taller my dad never overcame his aspergers because in his home country he was average height and he never had to deal with racial disadvantages in dating so he was able to meet and marry my mom based on his educational background being short and asian in the united states i literally don t even remember a single ioi indicator of interest from girls growing up like not even a smile from a random cashier or a flirty glance from a girl in class absolutely nothing and trust me after years in game i know iois when i see them now and do not recall anything close to the sort throughout high school and college what s worse as is often the case of people with aspergers i had an incredibly high sex drive and would often masturbate x a day while watching porn i wanted so badly to get laid and have sex with a girl that i finally made a lifelong commitment to learning game and social skills for the sake of getting my dick wet to some extent i don t think i would have ever learned game if i was born tall and handsome as weird as it seems i would have continued to live in my own bubble like my dad and focused on video games or technical skills learning beginner level game between ages i remember devouring just about every book there is to read about game and seduction i just found this stuff so fascinating and intriguing on a fundamental level here were average looking guys going out and getting laid with nothing but their wits and charm if there s a book or guide on game girls i ve read it mystery method david deangelo nlp goodlookingloser redpill simple pickup rsd lovesystems girlschase seduction reddit mark manson s models david deida s way of the superior man even weird stuff like the art of seduction by robert greene todd valentine ross jeffries the saddest thing is that instead of actually going out and practicing i continued to play video games in all my free time and occasionally try to use tricks and techniques from the books on e girls yeah i cringed even writing this i kept looking for that magic bullet that magic line that would just make a girl want to fuck me going through hours of reading to try to find that little gold nugget all with this knowledge deep in the back of my mind that eventually i d actually have to go out and apply this stuff in the real world i created a plentyoffish profile and an okcupid profile and messaged girl after girl with lines from my pickup reading with no results zero results out of all the stuff i read redpill was by far the most impactful looking back turns out there was a golden nugget after all buried in all that reading lift heavy weights unlike with girls i actually went out and bought a gym membership applying programs and making adjustments as needed i started out with rippetoe s starting strength and transitioned into stronglifts x after hitting plateaus after hitting a plateau in stronglifts x as well i found the most success by decreasing the frequency of exercise from x week to x week this is purely opinion and broscience but my best guess is that as my muscles grew they needed a longer time to recover than i was used to and that was why i stalled throw in some hiit and heavy keto dieting with one cheat meal a week and like magic my weight started coming off man this self improvement stuff is so fucking easy i thought to myself after doing my first pull up ever and noticing the outlines of a six pack for the first time i even started getting iois from girls for the first time in my life very rare but they started happening furthermore i was even forced to update my wardrobe and go shopping for myself because my clothes wouldn t fit anymore if there ever was a magic pill in life for me lifting was it at age i finally committed to bringing that same intensity at the gym into the field it was time to do some cold approach i could see that just sitting at home hitting on e girls online was not going to go anywhere so i quit gaming cold turkey and devoted all my spare time to learning pickup in the hopes of losing my virginity and getting laid for the first time i was brimming with confidence i just lost lbs and got in the best shape of my life if i could do that i could do anything or so i thought my first time cold approaching was at a mall like everyone else i initially walked around the hesitated to actually approach for the first half hour but i manned the fuck up and walked right up to a starbucks barista as my very first approach she was a cute girl from greece i thought the conversation flowed smoothly because she answered all my questions without much resistance but when i asked for her number she refused oh well onto the next girl i ended up approaching girls total on my first day out and couldn t even get a single number even though i asked every one of them even the ones that brushed me off from the very beginning i walked after them like a retard and asked for their number cringe what a slap in the face as is often the case with people on the spectrum i had absolutely no idea what kinds of mistakes i was making in these interactions with the girls and due to overconfidence and ego refused to acknowledge that i suck and continued approach after approach without making any adjustments just running the same shit over and over again with the same shitty result wtf why isn t this working it s game i m spitting game why aren t these girls giving me their number i kept thinking in my brain maybe it s the wrong mall the next day i went to another mall and approached another girls out of sheer luck i managed to finally grab a number from a cute girl with glasses at the bookstore and texted her like an excited puppy after getting in my car only to find out it was a fake number there s this thing called imposter syndrome where you have self doubt that you re actually qualified to be in a certain job or role in society and keep thinking that surely there must be someone better than you out there that deserves the position more than you people on the spectrum don t tend to have imposter syndrome most people with aspergers i know tend to have the opposite problem overconfidence it explains why my dad kept working on his skills and studying up on his engineering knowledge even when it was painfully obvious to any outside observer that it was his poor social skills at work that were holding him back not his technical knowledge it s why i kept doing the same thing over and over again with girls straight with no adjustments i had this stubborn belief that i read all these books on game and should be an expert by now who knew what i was doing that was how i got results in the gym why shouldn t it be the same case here i finally started to humble myself and learn to kill my own ego i was desperate for results so i started reading about game again from various forums and communities i learned that the longer the interaction goes the more likely the girl is to give you her number and go out on a date with you can t believe i missed that it s amazing how much you discover how much you missed in your reading when you actually go out in the field and try to apply what you read instead of just mentally masturbating to the material i went to the local mall again and this time focused on extending the conversation and introducing topic after topic until the conversation takes off and the girl starts talking about her life my aspie self somehow made the analogy to a lawnmower i had this frame that if i pull the string of conversation topics enough times eventually the engine will start and the conversation will take off cringe the results started coming in right away i finally got numbers out of the girls i approached with basic text game i finally set up a date with a hot girl from my hometown my first date i was so pumped up as i walked into the local park i had no idea how cringeworthy the whole thing was even after it ended looking back i don t think i did a single thing right but i kept trying to escalate and go for a kiss even though she turned me down every time in my mind i was doing everything right i was being a man and going for the kiss i was using kino and escalating instead of being a pussy why the fuck isn t this working if i were to try to find one line to describe my early years of game this would be it why the fuck isn t this working my big ego was getting in my way again i kept thinking that there was nothing wrong with my game and i was just getting unlucky if i just rolled the dice a few more times i d get laid for sure i had to find a new place to approach since i could never find more than girls at the mall to approach every time i went i finally settled on the train station since there s always a constant supply of fresh girls going in and out it was all about volume and quantity here and my first time at the train station i think i approached close to girls i was getting a lot of numbers from sheer volume not skill i managed to coordinate and set up more dates not a single one of them went well all of them went pretty much the exact same way i tried to escalate and got rejected at every advance so i went for a hail mary and tried to kiss close only to get rejected again nothing i was doing was working and like a dog chasing its own tail my logical brain just could not process what i was doing wrong every time and kept going in circles i started getting desperate and started to try night game to see if that made any difference at this point i had close to approaches and still no lays to speak of i managed to get one kiss by basically pulling a shy nerdy girl from an instadate into me and kissing her before she could react things were not going well night game was the answer my first several nights out i approached girl after girl with no results but one night i got lucky and pulled a girl from the dance floor up to dance and grinded against her with my hard on before making out with her things escalated quickly from there and i batted away every attempt at resistance and finally had my first lay at her place to this day i still count this as the best sex of my life since it was my first time having sex one of the unspoken advantages of aspergers is that there s less oxycontin so we tend to last longer in bed imagine me a year old virgin finally having sex for the first time and knocking it out of the park there really is nothing that can beat the dopamine rush from that and to this day i count it as the most satisfying experience in my entire life i pulled another girl home from the nightclub after another weeks and this ended up being my first long term relationship given how poorly everything else went with girls so far i was fully expecting to have her leave me within the span of a week and continued to grind out approaches at the train station finally killing my ego and attempting to anticipate failure in advance this time so i could take steps to lessen its impact to my surprise long term relationships were not difficult at all for me and i didn t have any problems maintaining frame or calling her out on her bullshit to maintain boundaries i thought back to my dad and his relationship with my mom before he lost his job and reached the startling conclusion that aspergers probably provides a competitive advantage in ltrs due to the natural confidence and i don t give a fuck attitude it s not like there weren t any fights or drama it s just that at that point i didn t really give a fuck and every time she threatened to leave me i d just walk out the door fully intending to and even looking forward to approaching girls at the mall and train station again but having her call me and tearfully apologize on the phone every time before i drove all the way to the mall the sex was good because i was able to naturally last a really long time which is not unusual for people on the spectrum things were looking up through hard work and sheer effort i managed to build a decently muscular body and get into a long term relationship with a white girl that was when my work life started to fall apart i skipped all of the company s after work happy hours and social gatherings in order to practice game at the mall or train station i basically didn t give a fuck about anything else except for game and it was painfully obvious to everyone at work that i was doing the bare minimum to get by while blowing off all the social gatherings my boss gave me a scathing performance review and basically attacked my technical expertise and ability to grasp new material even though i didn t make a single error and finished my work faster than ever i was becoming my dad this was not going to work out long term and i knew it i looked around my company and noticed that even though every other department hated them the sales team was the only group that pretty much had impunity from the bullshit of corporate politics the top sales guy at the company was making well over k year and he was a grade a asshole the first time i heard one of his conversations with a client i was shocked he sounded so fucking smooth and polished sounded like a goddamn genius on the phone and was polite and respectful as hell completely different from how he was like in person i knew i had to get in i immediately asked to transfer from my current finance job to a sales role and nailed the interview emphasizing my lack of approach anxiety and ability to deal with rejection though i framed it as door to door sales growing up not picking up girls at the train station lol i gave it everything i had i wanted to prove my asshole boss in finance wrong so i put in hour workdays days a week banging on the phone for leads the deals started closing and the money started coming in i was making well over figures for the first time in my life this was before i got really good at sales so i was purely playing the numbers game this experience taught me that something must be very wrong with my approach to women if i could make six figures convincing people to give money to my company why couldn t i have the same success with women i saw the other top sales guys in the company had no problems with girls and often hooked up women from other departments after work i guess when you re producing revenue for your company it s very hard to get fired i did start to notice common trends with them though they were all tall and white black no exceptions some of the shorter sales guys were struggling with women just like me i started to realize that life is not this fantasy world where wishful thinking can negate the harsh realities of the world for the longest time i had this mindset that race doesn t matter and height doesn t matter but it was time to deal with reality and accept the fact that when i approach girls i have an inherently inferior product and will need vastly more game in order to sell it than someone tall and good looking at this point i was making enough money to finally move out and get my own place i also had all these ambitious goals of starting my own business i was looking at the numbers and realized that like any other company i was getting paid peanuts compared to the revenue and value that i actually generated for the business even though there was much less workplace politics to deal with i knew that i had to have equity and ownership if i ever wanted to get rich my girlfriend was not supportive in any way of my plans to start a business so i immediately broke up with her and deleted everything no room for negative influences in my life had to deal with constant calls and harassment from her for a while but that eventually passed stuck in intermediate hell i had the loftiest expectations after getting my own place i made sure that i paid for a place with the absolute best logistics about blocks away from the best bars and clubs in town i figured that if i could get lays after approaches surely the sky is the limit and i would fuck at least more girls before the end of the year wrong approaches later nothing it was getting really frustrating because i was doing all the right things from a career standpoint my business was going really well and i started making as much money from the business as from my old sales job in its very first year my life consisted of sales sales sales on a hour cycle every day every monday friday i d do followups and cold calling from am to pm and spend the rest of the time reading about sales and girls every friday and saturday night i d go out and hit on girls in bars and clubs until am in the morning this is all while continuing to approach and hit on random girls on my daily routine like picking up groceries or walking on the street i hit around total approaches before finally getting my rd lay i noticed a pattern all of these lays were with girls that were highly into me right from the very beginning every time i had to go on a date or deal with resistance in any way i failed all of my lays were from girls i pretty much got physical with right away and made out with passionately before bringing them home the sad thing is even with all this failure i refused to make any real adjustments i kept looking for lines and techniques scouring materials for the best comebacks to shit tests i was going nowhere and it was getting so frustrating that i decided to bury my ego once more and ask for help from every community i could get my hands on including reddit i posted on redpill and every other seduction related forum i could think of and opened up about my frustrations something i hadn t done since my newbie days when i was complaining about how shitty my dates were going i received so much advice from well meaning community members but nothing worked when i applied it here i was completely frustrated with lack of results reaching out to everyone for advice and field testing it and still failing i was killing my ego and field testing everything and still getting nowhere a lot of the advice i was getting was that i was being waaay too aggressive and needed to work on developing empathy some advice was pointing out that i was too desperate and needed to have an abundance mindset still others said that i needed to hire a coach since it s impossible to pinpoint where you re going wrong by yourself after trying so hard to implement an abundance mindset and develop empathy i finally pulled the trigger and signed up for a rsd bootcamp i m not going to go into the specifics because i know some guys claim they actually got great results from it but for me i followed everything to the t and didn t notice much improvement at all i tried meditating and cultivating an atmosphere of fun vibes i tried raising my energy and vibration levels but didn t get anywhere i was going out to the clubs every friday and saturday and pretty much getting the same shitty results i was getting laid but not with the women i really wanted and not at nearly the frequency i d like after so much effort was put in it would take me on average approaches to get laid i ve read in comments before that people can t believe i made approaches and only got lays the sad and horrifying truth is that this continued for an entire year until i lost count of the approaches but could still count on one hand the number of actual lays the only shining light at the end of the tunnel is that all the lays i did get turned into fuck buddies so i knew that if i actually got good at this i d have no problem spinning plates but it was still getting on my nerves i started to get angry angry at american society for portraying asians in such an emasculated light angry at girls for autorejecting me and not seconds later latching onto a taller guy i wasn t anywhere close to angry enough to shoot up a school but i could empathize and see why people like elliott rodgers existed they didn t seem like crazy anomalies anymore intermediate hell was absolutely horrific because i felt like i was doing all the right things but still getting bad results it s like if you had the perfect clean cutting diet and worked out x a week and still couldn t gain muscle or lose weight at some point it s hard to maintain a positive mindset no matter how confident you are the breakthrough acting class by my rd year of game my ego was completely dead i didn t give a fuck how many books i read or how successful i was in maintaining fuck buddies or ltrs i just wanted to get good i was willing to trade my soul for success with women at this point because i invested so much time and energy and never wanted anything so badly in my entire life i didn t give a fuck about my successes in business and spent all my free time looking for answers on how to get good with girls my mindset at the time was i don t care if i have to make or approaches before i get good i don t give a fuck if i die of old age before i get good no matter what it takes i m going to get good with girls to the point where i can pull a girl home every time i go out i started looking into weird occult rituals involving sigils and spilling blood they didn t work nothing was off limits if it was something i didn t try yet i was willing to try it pretty soon i enrolled in an improv class and made friends with a guy that was trying to become an actor he introduced me to an acting class he was taking and i quickly enrolled i mean i spent on an rsd bootcamp with no noticeable results what s the worst that can happen with an acting class there were quite a few hot girls in the class but i didn t bother to approach i wanted to give this acting thing a shot and didn t want to get distracted i was absolutely terrible at acting i don t think there s a single skill so far that i m worse at i ended up paying for private on coaching with my acting teacher since none of these skits were going well and people were laughing at me he told me that i had to feel the emotions naturally and stop trying to act what he was saying made perfect sense but i had a hard time feeling the emotions in the scene due to my aspergers so i was about to call it quits when something remarkable happened he brought a camera over and had me record myself practicing the scene with him when i watched the footage of myself trying to act for the very first time a light bulb went off in my head holy fuck i look so fake and stiff and retarded my teacher was kind enough to lend me the video camera and tripod stand so i could practice at home because even though i had no natural talent he could see that i was really trying and could respect that he kept giving me advice on how to feel my inner emotions and bring them out and gave me weird assignments and try to find times in your week that you are angry try to identify times when you are jealous etc i tried to implement it all but didn t get anywhere i finally got results by meticulously going over every detail in my facial expressions and vocal tonality until there weren t any glaring mistakes anymore the next week my professor commemorated me on my performance saying i got so much better he couldn t believe it little did he know i go there by mechanically correcting errors in vocal tonality and facial expressions instead of actually feeling the emotions lmao this vocal tonality training had huge benefits in my business as well pretty soon i was closing deals from prospects that i thought were dead leads the money was pouring in like never before i instinctively realized that this was the missing piece my aspergers brain was focused completely on myself and my own viewpoint and could not zoom out and look at the way other people saw me until i had unmistakable footage in front of me of how weird i sounded and looked i practiced in front of the camera every day and imitated my favorite actors like robert downey jr in iron man and leonardo dicaprio in wolf of wall street i started wearing elevator shoes and making sure my appearance and fashion were perfect before going out at night at the end of acting class my teacher came up to me and said he was so proud of me and in all his years of teaching he can only count a handful of times that students came in as bad as me and improved to the level i did i told me that if i wanted a career in acting it s definitely not for me since i don t have the natural talent but that i should still be very proud of the progress i made funny thing is i don t think i got a single piece of good advice from him that worked everything i learned i learned by myself grinding it out in front of the video camera and practicing my lines over and over again until the body language and tonality were perfect the rest is history with the improvements in fashion hairstyle height and body language amp tonality i started getting more results than i knew what to do with every night i went out i got laid the girls were getting hotter and hotter i had to intentionally let some plates go because i simply didn t have enough time to handle them all after all that fucking i finally achieved my goal and decided to settle into a happy ltr amp x b my advice for people with aspergers light autism amp x b don t view it as a pure disadvantage like everything else there are tradeoffs and benefits you tend to view women as a puzzle to be solved other guys get into game to find the girl of their dreams or to indulge in hedonistic sexual fantasies but you are here to solve girls like a rubik s cube and don t let anyone tell you that s the wrong approach i wasted an entire year trying to implement advice from normal people on how to act more natural and have a more abundant vibe and learn empathy but that kind of advice just doesn t work for people on the spectrum because something is fundamentally different in the way we see the world it s like trying to teach a non native english speaker about grammar and telling them that if you just say the sentence out loud you can find the error because something will sound off shit like that is not helpful at all compared to other approaches like actually teaching them the rules of the english language and how they all interact with each other ironically enough it s entirely possible for the non native english speaker to surpass the native speaker relatively quickly since he s actually learning the fundamental rules of english grammar instead of just relying on feel as someone on the spectrum you also come into game with a few natural advantages over other men little no approach anxiety less emotional clutter in your mind holding you back ability to give all your focus on one thing natural confidence and idgaf attitude last longer in bed it s not about confidence it s about looks amp skill for the longest time i thought that getting girls was all about confidence and having the balls to approach this could not be farther from the truth and my own journey is living proof of that i had massive confidence in my second year approaching girl after girl with little to no hesitation i didn t have any insecurities about my height or my race but it led me nowhere when people say being dark triad automatically gets you girls i say bullshit a dark triad personality combined with height and good looks will lead to massive success with women a dark triad personality on a short guy won t make much difference without social skill looks really are as important as theredpill says lift lift like your life depends on it because it fucking does dress to impress and use elevator shoes because girls are superficial as fuck it s hard as fuck to sell a shitty product so why wouldn t you do everything possible to maximize your looks before going out skill in game is largely about body language tonality facial expressions and eye contact if you re not the best looking guy you can still have massive success with women by making sure all of these factors are perfect these will lead to crazy results in sales as well so hone in on them every day and sharpen them until there are no more mistakes in the way you look and the way your words come off no more uptalk with girls confident breaking rapport downwards inflection tonality no more shitty eye contact get a fidget spinner if necessary and stare into it every day until your eye contact is laser focused people with aspergers tend to have this weird off center look to their eyes where one eye is looking in a slightly different direction from the other eye and it s creepy as fuck look up a picture of jeff bezos if you want to know what i mean normal social skills amp conversation skills are a lot more important than game all the flashy game lines are absolutely useless and will lead you nowhere if they aren t accompanied by a strong social foundation are you able to have a conversation for longer than minutes with someone on a topic you re not personally super interested in if not you have work to do sales will teach you faster than anything else things like mirroring building rapport and small talk all absolutely critical for success with women do not ignore small talk and having a normal conversation just spitting game at a girl on a date and escalating is creepy as fuck if you can t even hold a conversation then stop looking for advice on redpill on game related stuff you should be going out and looking for advice on sales or how to make friends and influence people that doesn t mean you carry on an entire conversation with a girl like a normal guy that also leads nowhere you have to occasionally use light teasing to spice things up emphasis on light teasing not heavy negging or ridiculous game routines like the cube tried it doesn t work ignore mindset advice and focus on technical skills that can be measured there will be a natural tendency to post on other forums asking for advice when you start to go out and struggle with girls most of these pieces of advice will be focused on mindset and other irrelevant factors if the advice does not first involve sending a picture or video of what you look and sound like it s useless someone with aspergers does not just naturally get it the way a native speaker of a language does he needs to learn the fundamental rules of the language in order to stand a chance if you re so far up the spectrum that you can t even tell what s wrong when looking at a video recording of yourself then you ll need to hire a coach or have a good friend who is socially calibrated help out there s simply no other way to get good than focusing on body language and tonality in front of a video camera if there was i would have found it by now learn to make adjustments quickly i strongly believe that if you take nothing else away from this you need to read this and internalize it with aspergers it s incredibly likely that you ll do the same thing over and over again and be okay with getting the same shitty results because of a naturally high ego and unwillingness to adjust normal guys would be like oh shit this isn t working and either quit or try something new but every time i hear stories of a guy approaching girls and getting lay they always fall into the aspergers autism spectrum bucket where they mindlessly grind out approach after approach without making any changes let me say this nothing is more pathetic and stupider than actually putting in tons of effort into something and getting no results it s not a badge of honor and a sign of incredible perseverance it s a sign that something is fundamentally wrong with your approach and you re not willing to make adjustments because of your ego or some other bullshit every sunday we see football teams that make adjustments quickly at halftime like the new england patriots and these are the teams that have the most success part of the problem is a lot of people on the spectrum tend to immerse themselves in video games in their younger years video games are a horrible analogy to life and teaches you all the wrong things in wow doing the same dungeon over and over again is the best way to get good results in league of legends grinding the same champion over and over again is the best way to get good and climb elo the real world is so incredibly different that i think it s much more similar to troubleshooting a broken computer if something on your computer isn t working do you just keep running the same antivirus over and over again hoping it will magically fix it after the th time no if something isn t working try something else if it still doesn t work after trying multiple different things reach out to experts this is remarkably similar to how to get results in the real world know the difference between dark triad and autism aspergers i ll be the first to admit that there s actually a lot of similarities between psychopathy and autism however things quickly fall apart once you actually look at the core traits of psychopathy which are glib and superficial charm when you re growing up it can be comforting to indulge in a fantasy of thinking that you re dark triad because you have problems with empathy and mirror neurons just like a psychopath but you re not one of them a psychopath is actually good with people and can charm the socks off of them upon first meeting them your awkward ass cannot recognize that you are firmly in the sperg camp not the dark triad camp no more fantasies of being a psychopath and having unlimited power you re a fucking sperg and have a lot of work to do to catch up to the normies let alone develop the glib and superficial charm of a full blown dark triad
16223,introduction this article is the first part of a part series part will discuss why a man s purposes are the most important things in his life and why they also bring him the most pleasure part also discusses how a man s confidence pushes him towards his purposes and anxiety pushes him away from his purposes part will discuss how a woman s attraction to a man is centered on his purposes which in turn create his emotional experience and his reality part will discuss how a man can manage his ego to maximize the pleasure he receives from pursuing his purposes and minimize his anxiety purpose and emotion the most important thing in a man s life are the purposes he chooses to pursue and the key to a successful and happy life is choosing your purposes with your rational mind rather than your emotions if you do not consciously and rationally articulate your purposes to yourself your subconscious emotions will determine your purposes and emotion without rational guidance usually leads to ruin worse yet if you do not consciously and rationally determine your purposes yourself others will determine them for you often by manipulating your emotions all human emotions and activity can be conceptualized in terms of purposes everything you do is directed to some purpose whether you realize it or not if you are watching tv eating cheetos and scratching your balls your purposes are watching tv eating cheetos and scratching your balls the question is not whether you have purposes but what your purposes are discussions of purpose often become abstract and meaningless so i seek here to link purpose to fundamental biological emotions human evolved to feel pleasure and positive emotion to motivate us to seek things that help in our survival and reproduction and pain and negative emotions to avoid purposes that will lead to us harm positive emotions include the desire for food sex and affection while negative emotions include grief shame guilt depression and anxiety positive emotions usually fill us with energy and enthusiasm to motivate us to move while negative emotions cripple us to prevent us from moving but every emotion serves some purpose and the key to a healthy and happy life is not to repress or kill your emotions but to put each emotion in its proper place so that they work in harmony for your overall good our rational mind is a much weaker than our emotions and is often overwhelmed hijacked and tricked by emotion the only thing that can defeat an emotion is a stronger emotion so the primary responsibility of your rational mind is not to conquer your emotions but to order your emotions properly so that your higher emotions predominate over your lower ones positive emotion the biological systems underlying positive emotion can be summarized using a familiar quote life is a journey not a destination the primary brain chemical that regulates positive emotion is a neurotransmitter called dopamine dopamine is released every time we do something pleasurable when you eat a tasty meal snort a line of cocaine or have sex you also feel dopamine when you experience higher pleasures like acceptance by the tribe love affection and the joy of accomplishing a goal or helping somebody but strangely most dopamine is released on the way to achieving the pleasurable goal rather than after we attain the goal itself most people think of pleasure as a destination you see or conceptualize a pleasurable goal you take steps to achieve that goal and you feel pleasure after you achieve the goal i call the pleasure you feel after you achieve some pleasurable goal destination pleasure but the journey to the pleasurable thing is stronger than arriving at the destination when you see or conceptualize a pleasurable goal and take steps to achieve that pleasurable goal you feel pleasure on the journey to the pleasurable goal i call this feeling journey pleasure as artie lange said the best part of doing cocaine is going to your dealer to get it the excitement and enthusiasm you feel on the way to something your subconscious thinks will be pleasurable is much stronger and longer lasting than the destination pleasure you feel when you actually consumer that thing this is why i consider journey pleasure to be a superior and higher pleasure the superiority of journey pleasure makes perfect sense from an evolutionary perspective humans need to go get food find shelter and have sex but evolution doesn t care if we feel pleasure after we achieve those things evolution is more concerned with getting us to those things in the first place which is why we are wired to feel most of our pleasure as we move towards the goal rather than after we get it we did not evolve to rest on our laurels and celebrate after getting something we want instead we evolved to immediately want to go get the next thing we have all experienced this on some level we have all won some championship completed some final exam scored with some hot girl or achieved some other goal only to find ourselves underwhelmed and feeling empty after we achieve the thing we thought we wanted as george bernard shaw famously said there are two tragedies in life one is to lose your heart s desire the other is to gain it this is because journey pleasure is much stronger than destination pleasure and once the journey is over the destination pleasure feels relatively weak and empty but make no mistake journey pleasure only exists when the journey leads to destination pleasure if there is no pot of gold at the end of the journey our subconscious mind will not generate the dopamine necessary to motivate us our brain is a pleasure seeking machine and if there is no pleasure involved we simply will not pursue something no matter how noble or important the goal we are animals not angels it is just a happy coincidence that pursuing noble and important goals sometimes brings us pleasure the brain s motivation system is somewhat paradoxical even though we are motivated by destination pleasure we feel most of our pleasure on the way to that destination pleasure so we often don t even care about the destination pleasure once we get to it billionaires work hour weeks to make a fortune only to give the fortune away after they have receive it they don t care about the money they have more than they could ever use they love the game nevertheless if there is no fortune or other attractive prize at the end of the journey billionaires would not be motivated to work hour weeks in the first place human beings will only do something if we feel like there will be some payoff in the end or if we are afraid of some worse outcome a child will only do his homework if he fears punishment or if he genuinely believes he will receive some worthwhile reward for doing it either in the short term or in the long term similarly as you move through life you will only be motivated to work hard if you believe your work will lead to something that something can be money developing your skills creating something new and valuable or helping people ideally your work will pay off in all of those ways the difference between successful and unsuccessful people is that successful people see their life as leading towards some higher purpose even when things are going badly even when they do something that sucks they are building towards something higher they are building their resume developing skills saving money learning lessons meeting people etc unsuccessful people feel like no matter what they do they will never get to the promised land which is why they are not motivated to work hard today successful people run towards a goal unsuccessful people run on a treadmill journey pleasure and emotional stability journey pleasure is superior to destination pleasure because it is stronger lasts over a longer period of time and does not require external things to be satisfied destination pleasure only lasts for the brief moment while you consume the pleasurable thing you feel destination pleasure while you eat the cake have sex or hug your friend but the pleasure disappears a short time after and you need some external thing to give you pleasure again journey pleasure on the other hand lasts for as long as you are working towards your goal so you can feel it anytime and anywhere because it is primarily mental if you are building your business you can feel journey pleasure as you work as you eat lunch and even as you have a few beers with your friends to wind down because all of those activities are taking you towards your goal journey pleasure is required for emotional stability and rationality humans are pleasure seeking creatures and we cannot think rationality if we are chasing one brief pleasure after another but journey pleasure satiates our desire for pleasure and once we have a consistent source of journey pleasure we can make rational long term plans even people that enjoy journey pleasure need to feed their lower desires occasionally but because their higher pleasures are satiated all of their thoughts and emotions are not directed towards satisfying their lower pleasures purpose routines your brain constantly creates maps of the world based on your purposes to determine where pleasure and threat exist as they are defined by your purposes your brain creates a spatial map of your immediate surroundings coloring what you believe to be indicators of pleasure and threat with emotion so you are drawn or repelled by those indicators your brain also creates a more abstract map of your life marking pleasures and threats that may occur in the future as you pursue your purposes to see this spatial map right now just look around what you see is not necessarily reality but a map of the world that your brain created with sources of pleasure and threat as you understand them emphasized by your brain to draw your attention similarly you can feel the abstract map by thinking about your future if you think about the upcoming week you will feel good about the pleasurable things you think will happen and anxiety about the shitty things you think will happen interestingly your spatial map and your more abstract map are both created by the same part of your brain the hippocampus to navigate these maps your brain creates what i call purpose routines a purpose routine is a set of procedures and rules designed to lead you to a certain goal like a computer program you can learn purpose routines with your conscious mind but after you do it a few times it becomes subconscious and executable with little to no conscious thought a simple purpose routine is walking downstairs to get something from the fridge tying your shoe or brushing your teeth purpose routines can also be more complicated drafting a routine letter to a client repairing an hvac unit or driving to work experienced doctors can even perform delicate surgery almost on autopilot because they have done it so many times sometimes your conscious mind even forgets the instructions to a purpose routine but your subconscious mind can still do it we need subconscious purpose routines to function because we cannot consciously think about every single little thing we are doing our conscious mind can only process around to pieces of information at one time but our subconscious mind can process much more most of our actions at any time are purpose routines running on autopilot if we learn to do something in the wrong way our brain might lock that defective purpose routine away in our subconscious making it difficult for our conscious mind to reprogram it the subconscious nature of purpose routines helps explain why sometimes very talented people are terrible teachers their skills are locked away as purpose routines so they cannot explain to another person what exactly they are doing purpose routines also explain why quack pick up artist instructors often fail to communicate their abilities to their students much of what we consider to be charm charisma and alpha behavior is an automatic expression of our purpose routines and it is very difficult to consciously articulate what exactly those behaviors are your brain learns to associate purpose routines with pleasure so for example if you have enjoyed snorting cocaine a few times your brain will learn to associate the steps of snorting a line of cocaine with pleasure even seeing a line of cocaine or going somewhere you snorted cocaine may cause your brain to release dopamine because it is anticipating the destination pleasure at the end of the journey it thinks it is on purpose routines help explain why addiction is so difficult to overcome your brain is a pleasure seeking missile so whenever it feels bad bored or eager to do something essentially a lack of pleasure it will automatically start running purpose routines it knows will lead to its drug of choice without your conscious mind even realizing this is why addicts often need to consciously and carefully monitor their behavior because your brain relies on your purpose routines to obtain pleasure it is all the more important to consciously determine your purposes most peoples subconscious minds are littered with garbage purpose routines they automatically run to whenever they want pleasure video games drugs alcohol wasting time on the internet etc whether we realize it or not our brain is constantly seeking pleasure and if we are not directing what pleasure it seeks it will probably seek the lowest cheapest pleasures that will ultimately lead us to ruin anxiety the key to happiness therefore seems simple pick a few good positive emotionally attractive purposes pursue those purposes collect journey pleasure along the way and live happily ever after why then are so many people miserable the main obstacle to journey pleasure is anxiety which is a subconscious mechanism designed by evolution to help you pick which purpose to pursue animals and humans feel anxiety when the subconscious brain believes there is a threat or anomaly on the way to the purpose it is seeking and or the subconscious brain is faced with multiple purposes that seem equally appealing when faced with either of these situations the anxiety circuit floods you with negative emotion to make you freeze and stop progressing along the path you were on and switches your mind into information gathering mode so that you can figure out which purpose to pursue the more important the goal and the bigger the threat anomaly or conflict between goals the stronger the anxiety to our brains a threat or an anomaly is anything that makes us feel like we are on the wrong path either because it will cause us to not achieve the goal or worse anxiety is the opposite of journey pleasure we feel journey pleasure only when we see a clear path to the goal but we feel anxiety when we see obstacles and threats on the way to the goal our anxiety decreases when we feel journey pleasure and our journey pleasure decreases when we feel anxiety both emotions are necessary we need journey pleasure to motivate ourselves to pursue the things we need but we also need anxiety so that we don t run into dangerous situations when our journey pleasure outweighs our anxiety we go for the goal but when our anxiety is stronger we stay frozen journey pleasure is the cure to anxiety but to feel journey pleasure we must feel like we can overcome the threats and obstacles on the way to our purposes anxiety is generally stronger than journey pleasure and with good reason if a mouse sees a piece of cheese guarded by a cat it should not pursue the cheese because the reward for getting the cheese is a little pleasure but the consequence of getting caught by the cat is death therefore when weighing the journey pleasure and anxiety of a particular course of action our brain puts much more weight on anxiety this means that humans are extremely risk averse and our default answer to any new adventure is no scientifically speaking anxiety is different from fear fear is the fight or flight feeling we get when we are actually in the presence of the threat whereas anxiety is the feeling of paralysis we get when we think there might be a threat a mouse who will not walk into a cage because it smells cat odor feels anxiety whereas a mouse that actually sees a cat and starts running from it feels fear anxiety becomes fear if we feel like the threat has actually arrived and people with very bad anxiety often have panic attacks which is a fear response when most people say fear they really mean anxiety but it is important to understand this distinction because fear is often an important motivator whereas anxiety is often a hinderance as i will explain later finally many kinds of anxiety exist social anxiety which views high status members of the tribe as a threat separation anxiety which views distance from the tribe as a threat obsessive compulsive disorder which views a lack of order and hygiene as a threat etc to simplify this article i simply use the word anxiety to refer to all of these emotions anxiety and purpose routines just as our subconscious mind tags certain purpose routines as pleasurable so we pursue them it also tags others as threat or obstacle so we avoid them for example if you put your hand on a hot stove and burn it your brain will subconsciously associate putting your hand on a hot stove with threat and strike you with anxiety if you start to do it again even if you consciously decide to put your hand on a hot stove because somebody offered you a million dollars to do it your subconscious mind will flood you with negative emotion and freeze your muscles so you do not do it moving your hand to the stove will feel like swimming through molasses because your underlying biological systems will be doing everything they can to stop you our brain uses anxiety for memory and map building because we need to know where not to go both spatially in our immediate surroundings and more abstractly in our life this is partly why drugs that reduce anxiety like marijuana alcohol and xanax also impair your memory anxiety is literally responsible for building the world we experience but as we will see anxiety can create a distorted view of the world the brain s process of painting certain purpose routines as threat is useful because it helps us automatically avoid dangerous situations without even consciously thinking about them we do this every single day with thousands of potential threats but anxiety tries to do a thorough job of documenting all of our threats so it often registers false positives these false positives occur when your brain subconsciously thinks something is a threat or obstacle when it is really not your brain subconsciously thinks something is a threat or obstacle when in reality you have the ability to overcome it or your brain associates a purpose routine with a threat or obstacle that will not be there in the future sometimes your brain does all of this at once for example imagine you go bowling for the first time and get stabbed at the bowling alley in that case your brain may associate bowling or going to the bowling alley with threat and make you feel anxiety the next time you consider going bowling no matter where the bowling alley is or who is there but getting stabbed is not a regular or inherent part of bowling so the brain s association of bowling alley with threat is wrong and counterproductive now imagine how many false positives your brain has created since your childhood and how many possible paths your brain has subconsciously marked as forbidden without your consent or realization most peoples subconscious minds are full of paths that have been wrongly labeled as negative and these paths accumulate to form complex emotional and belief systems that cripple us this mechanism often operates subconsciously without us even knowing what is happening we just feel bad when we leave our comfort zone and we don t know why anxiety may manifest itself in many different ways paralysis endless rumination that goes nowhere listlessness a desire to procrastinate hesitancy timidity laziness a tendency to become distracted a weird feeling you cannot explain a feeling of pending doom rational arguments as to why you should do something else etc anxiety will use any trick it can find to make you stop pursuing the goal including rational reasons that you cannot stop thinking about sometimes those reasons are laughably stupid and sometimes they are solid and should be taken into account it is your job to figure out which is which anxiety does not just try to make us pick a different path than the one we are considering it often causes us to not consider certain purposes at all most people never even consider following their dreams because their brain kills those thoughts before they even make it to their conscious mind most people live in a world of invisible walls they create for themselves most people never leave their narrow comfort zone because their brain subconsciously convinces them they will fail i strongly suspect this is also partly why people get stuck in their ways and more closed minded as they get older there has simply been more time for negativity to accumulate in their mind modern society exacerbates this problem the anxiety circuit is a primitive circuit designed to react to simple threats in the jungle not abstract complex threats like an emotionally unstable girlfriend a shitty job market or other complex changes and challenges that we face in the modern world the media and entertainment industry are also constantly trying to scare us into thinking that everything is a threat most people know the media and entertainment industry lie and fearmonger but if this programming only works of the time on us that is still a ton of irrational anxieties that are now part of our subconscious programming to make matters worse anxiety often hijacks our rational mind and creates false beliefs to match our garbage emotions the world is infinitely complicated which means that you can confabulate facts to support almost any decision you make or belief you hold and this is exactly what your mind does when it really wants to pursue a certain purpose or not pursue a purpose for example imagine somebody grows up in an environment where their friends family and society constantly tell them that it is very hard or impossible for the little guy to get ahead that person s brain will subconsciously associate the purpose routine of working hard to make money with insurmountable obstacles and threats if you asked them if it was possible for the little guy to get ahead they would rationally explain to why it was not this person may even use true facts to make their argument but they would only do so by ignoring all the other facts that contradicted their argument of course this person will never become rich because every time they do anything to make progress along that path their subconscious mind will cause them to feel anxiety and do something else instead even his conscious mind will often sabotage him because it has been subconsciously programmed by his emotions to form a series of false beliefs about the world in this way his emotions actions and beliefs will form a vicious cycle that will make it impossible for him to become rich the solution to anxiety and negative purpose routines is not always to ignore them and plow ahead anxiety serves an evolutionary purpose and your subconscious mind can store and quickly access much more information about threats than your conscious mind can sometimes you get a bad feeling because something really is a threat even though your conscious mind cannot articulate exactly why just because anxiety sometimes produces false positives does not mean that all anxiety is a false positive ignoring anxiety will deprive you of an extremely rich source of information and potentially expose you to danger instead of just ignoring your anxiety you should rationally analyze it and determine whether the threat you feel is real or not if i get a bad feeling about something i try to articulate to myself in words what is causing that bad feeling for example if i feel anxiety about a business deal i try to figure out if there is a real threat or if i am just afraid of the unknown unfortunately for people with lots of purpose routines that have been polluted negatively it will take a long time to clean your purpose routines that have been wrongly polluted anxiety is not the only negative emotion that colors our thoughts guilt shame depression jealousy also hijack our purpose routines and beliefs these other negative emotions mix with anxiety to create a terrible mixture of false beliefs falsely tainted purpose routines and constant negative thoughts and emotions cleaning this mess is extremely difficult because our false beliefs and purpose routines layer on top of each other over the course of years so to fix ourselves we must unwind each layer with our conscious mind reprogram our mind to see it as positive and then move to the next layer this process can be very difficult and time consuming which is part of the reason you should not bother with damaged women the unknown as our brain builds maps of the world and purpose routines to navigate those maps it must deal with the fact that much of the world is simply unknown to us the unknown contains the two main things which cause anxiety potentially infinite threats and infinite potential paths our brain needs to know which path to take so it runs the regular anxiety program when faced with the unknown we freeze and slowly try to gather information so we can figure out which path to follow the bible says that the human desire for knowledge of the universe is a result of anxiety when eve was faced with threat for the first time the snake she felt anxiety and ate of the tree of knowledge of good and bad evil is a mistranslation so she could become like god eve probably desired to become god because she faced threat for the first time felt unsafe and wanted to defeat that threat she then brought her anxiety to adam and convinced him to eat the forbidden fruit as well this was history s first shit test which adam failed gaining knowledge of good and bad did not make adam and eve gods instead they became even more fearful aristotle said that the highest and most noble pleasure for man is the desire for knowledge but the bible says that knowledge of good and bad pleasure and threats is useless if you do not have the courage to actually confront and defeat those threats without that courage gathering more information will cause you to only become more anxious because now you know about more threats when adam and eve gained knowledge of good and bad they became afraid of everything and interestingly the first threat that adam and eve recognized was their own sexuality i think the bible is correct it is true that one of our strongest emotions is the desire for knowledge but that desire is caused by anxiety we gather information so we can keep ourselves safe from threat and figure out what to do but information gathering often just makes us more anxious anxiety induced information gathering is a useful tool for animals exploring a physical environment but it is less useful for humans trying to navigate the abstract map of their life if we freeze and try to gather information to determine what to do next in our life we may stay frozen forever because the information we need may never come and even if it does come we may not have the courage to actually face the threats on our path sometimes in life you need to just go for it and leap into the unknown and sometimes you need to do so without having adequate information many people stricken with anxiety endlessly ruminate and never come to a conclusion because they do not have the information to decide what to do next or because they know the right path but ignore it because they see the threats on the way at the same time the unknown can contain potentially infinite pleasure so we have a deep and powerful fascination with the unknown and the transcendent no animal can survive without venturing into the unknown so we evolved to want to explore the unknown and figure out what is going on in there we always want to go beyond what we know make the unknown known and then go further into the unknown in fact the journey pleasure we get from venturing into the unknown is the strongest type of journey pleasure possible because all the pleasure in the known world is finite but the pleasure in the unknown is potentially infinite the strongest pleasure a human being can feel is the thrill of venturing into the unknown to create a future transcendent reality humans evolved to create things to guarantee ourselves and others pleasure in the future but once our creations give us an easy path to pleasure instead of enjoying it we wish to venture into the unknown again humans inherently desire transcendence the burning desire to go beyond whatever we have this emotion is impetus for the human race s insatiable desire to explore innovate and conquer but as we will see this desire is also the death knell for many friendships and romantic relationships we must venture into the unknown consciously and voluntarily so we can create a path through it that reaches the pleasure but keeps us safe too much unknown overwhelms and cripples us because we cannot carve paths through it quickly enough to get to our goals too much order we get bored humans literally evolved to feel best when exactly on the border of chaos and order as jordan peterson describes it similarly flow occurs when we do something that lies just outside of our ability this desire to make order out of chaos is one of the strongest feelings that human beings can have humans love to find patterns in randomness which is why we love music when we hear a pattern in a song two times we get a quick jolt of dopamine if we hear it a third time however it is also this desire to find patterns that causes people to become addicted to gambling or make stupid investments in the stock market when the blackjack table or the stock market changes in a way we feel is a pattern we feel like that pattern will continue which causes us to bet on it but casinos and the stock market are not designed to follow a pattern so betting on the pattern will cause you to lose money in fact i strongly suspect that casinos and the stock market are purposely designed to act randomly or in the opposite of the expected pattern so that sophisticated investors and casino owners can bilk poor saps that feel like they have found a pattern although humans strongest desire is to venture into the unknown most people cannot do so because they are crippled by anxiety as we will learn later anxiety is alleviated by the alpha male the dark side of the unknown although anxiety is always difficult to contend with anxiety caused by the unknown is particularly crippling because your rational mind cannot help you your rational mind is an information processing machine and can evaluate known threats or obstacles with information it previously gathered but with no information our rational mind cannot help which is why our emotions often take over when faced with the unknown we also have no purpose routines that we can rely on for pleasure when faced with the unknown so we are at the mercy of our negative emotions most people that have chronic anxiety are generally anxious of the unknown not specific identifiable threats people with anxiety disorders often have too much unknown coming at them from all sides and cannot create paths through it fast enough their boss is an unpredictable asshole their girlfriend is unstable their friends are shitty their own behavior creates more problems for them that it solves and worst of all they are simply unprepared for all the problems the world throws at them the more unknown they face the more they are crippled with paralysis so the less progress they make so the more unknown they are faced with it becomes a vicious cycle no situation is ever completely unknown most situations we contend with are a mix of known and unknown elements so our anxiety of the unknown can latch onto real facts to justify our paralysis anxiety never says don t move forward because you fear the unknown and you re a pussy instead it says you should not move forward because of reasons x y and z and those reasons will sound perfectly rational and logical fear it is important to know the difference between fear and anxiety because fear if harnessed correctly can be an extremely powerful motivator our subconscious mind will try to seek the clearest and easiest paths to pleasure which often lead to things like drugs pornography and video games almost all higher purposes have at least some threat associated with them and a purpose tinged with even a little threat may cause our subconscious mind to push us to take an easier path negative emotions like anxiety are generally stronger than positive emotions like journey pleasure so we will give up on a positive reward like journey pleasure if there is even a little anxiety associated with it this is why most people primarily chase lower pleasures rather than higher ones one way to force yourself to take the right path is to use fear fear is one of our strongest emotions if not the strongest emotion fear is even stronger than anxiety because fear indicates there is a currently present threat that will kill or destroy you if you do not immediately fight or run whereas you feel anxiety when there is a potential but yet unrealized threat we will gladly run down a path littered with potential threats if there is an actual threat chasing us down that path in ancient times the roman army would punish disobedient lazy and timid soldiers so harshly that it was famously said that roman troops were more afraid of their commanders than the opposing armies which is why the roman army was so courageous and successful on the battlefield our motivation is lowest when we see a threat blocking our way to the goal it is highest when we see a clear path to the goal and our fear is behind us pushing us towards the goal therefore if you are feeling unmotivated or feeling motivated to do the wrong thing you should create fear for yourself either by focusing your thoughts and emotions on the consequences of not doing the right thing or by creating an abstract fear for yourself like the fear of god without fear you are prone to chase lower easier pleasures rather than higher more difficult pleasures humans place disproportionate weight on pleasures and pains that will occur in the short term and we wrongly discount pleasures and pains that may occur in the long term if i have strong pleasure available to me now but the pain associated with consuming that easy pleasure will not occur until much later my emotions will incline me towards the easy pleasure now this is all the more prevalent when the later pain is abstract and difficult to conceptualize for example if ignore my training to chase easy pleasure now i will not see the pain of that decision until i lose the championship game which may not occur until many months from now to motivate myself to train hard i bring that future pain to the present i am not saying that one should constantly feel the emotion of fear the flight or fight response that fear produces is incredibly damaging and stressful on your body and evolved to only be invoked in emergencies and for a brief period of time if you have ever been genuinely afraid like in a fight or a car accident you know you cannot sustain that emotion for a long period of time the fear that motivates is a rational understanding the short and long term consequences of not pursuing the correct purpose not an emotional response for example my industry is very competitive and i know that if i do not work hard some upstart will take the top spot from me just as i took the top spot in the past from the previous winners that became complacent this is the same fear that causes me to not text and drive at the same time arrogance and laziness are the result of too much unhealthy anxiety and not enough healthy fear arrogance comes from enjoying the pleasure that high status brings and laziness comes from fear of the unknown arrogant lazy people enjoy feeling high status but fear the unknown so they lie to themselves and others that their current purpose routines are good enough but the world is constantly changing and the unknown is constantly encroaching so you will eventually be defeated if you do not venture into it a humble person doesn t enjoy the pleasure of high status he reaches for a higher pleasure the pleasure of venturing forth into the unknown knowing he will have to change his purpose routines to defeat whatever may lay therein fear should not be your greatest motivator your strongest motivator should be the journey pleasure that comes from pursuing a grand purpose but everybody is prone to becoming lazy and arrogant at some point especially after we have accomplished something so it is beneficial to have the ability to scare yourself to get back on track when necessary threat constantly surrounds us and anxiety makes us reluctant to face that threat so we sometimes need a stronger fear to force us to fight that threat most people in the modern world are motivated by fear not by any grand purpose they may enjoy some aspects of their jobs but the main thing pushing them to wake up and go to work in the morning is the fear of losing their job becoming homeless and being rejected by their tribe whatever that is journey pleasure is a rare and delicate flower that is hard to cultivate whereas fear is a more solid and consistent motivator which is why self motivated people are so rare in earlier times people feared their father their priest their teachers their society their king and their god and this fear propelled them to pursue higher purposes nowadays people fear dying and being homeless and whatever their tribe tells them to fear in la people fear being ugly in sjw circles people fear being called racist etc so they are content with living a mediocre existence the modern world makes a devil s bargain with us if we become a conformist slave we will have nothing to fear but by giving us nothing to fear the modern world ensures we stay a conformist slave this comfortable slave who had no higher purpose is nietzsche s last man i ran out of space on reddit please see the rest of this article on

blank because it s always going to be changing depending on the woman you are talking to the reason you do this is because you want to build as much baseline comfort as possible before you two even meet each other it plays on creating a sense of destiny and serendipity that will be important later on you want to create an effect where it s meant to be you want the story of how you two met and fell for each other be the plot of a romance drama commonalities are a major key to making this happen most important thing define the logistics you are after the whole reason you are using airbnb game is to improve your existing logistics ask yourself and find out the best nightclubs and restaurants in your city than find the hottest or richest female host closest to those locations example you live mins away from all the action in your city and on top of that you also live with family members you have shit logistics it s hard to pull constantly because you are so far away and you really can t practice game as hard you like because its hard to pull you can t drink if you re going to save money and drive yourself there because you put yourself at risk of duis and having to pay for parking you re going to be wasting s of dollars on uber and lifts rides if you do want to drink you re going to get less sleep because of the commute to get there and back it would be so much easier if you can just walk across the street to the club right so let s use a city like phoenix az for example there are only two locations worth living in phoenix for game in tempe with all the slutty asu women and scottsdale where the bitches with money and the industry live if you search on instagram and find a hot women i mean straight universal s from az the picture is most likely taken in scottsdale those are the locations to game in so why not just use airbnb game so you can live in the area you want to spend most of your time anyways makes it easy to pull when you stay across the street from the club you can walk to the club and walk to the bars restaurants you have your dates set up for it s all about the set up and this is how you create the perfect set up by having good logistics so you would want to find the female bnb host that are in those locations scottsdale has all the nightclubs and tempe has those asu young college sluts that you can just day game both areas have high foot traffic define the type of women that you are after you also want to define the type of relationship you are going to want to pursue here are the ones i use young hot plate that i can use as a wing woman i train her to basically be a female pua to game with me and pull threesomes with older average women that have lots of money that can spoil me and be a sugar mom info you want to find out about her logistics you want a host that will be there in person handing you the keys hosts that will also be staying with you during your stay hosts that have no men in their profile pics you want single women at least women who don t live with their boyfriends you want hosts where its only going to be her and you staying for the duration no other family members or friends also staying there it should just be the two of you during the duration when you re searching for places on the app you want to filter by private room and shared room you don t want to have the whole place to yourself you also want to find out as much info about her before you pick her to stay with using social media to run recon find her facebook and i g profiles to find out the locations she visits who her friends are what she does during her free time work you want to find this information out to help with the conversations you will have with her so you know what to talk about and can create more commonalities which are very important you need to be on the lookout and trying to find as many commonalities as you can at all times the two most important things that makes this game work will be the commonalities and the love bombing sex to find her social media profiles you can search by just her name and just match her face if you can t find it that way just message her and get her number i g account using basic text game all you need to do is find a b s justification so that its not weird example you see that she likes hiking text her from the app and asks her about it ask if she has any recommendations tell her you would love to check it out and that it sounds nice and if she has any pictures you can check out and she will give you her i g account so you can view them the hiking is the justification b s that you use it can be anything just use some info from her profile is the easiest way these women are very helpful they want to be a good host and show you around the city she would love for you to be an additional follower on her page once you have the i g just find her on facebook if you get her number just type it in any social media platform and it will find her automatically for you the same goes for her email address to get her number just use another bullshit justification like the app always crashes on your phone and it would be more reliable and convenient for you guys if you just exchanged numbers instead of communicating to each other from the app in case something happens the good thing about exchanging social media with her before you even meet her is if your social media is on point with high value content it acts as a dhv it shows you have social proof to build comfort with her and pre selection by all the women on your profile if a female looks at my profile and i m surrounded by l a model s and above and they fuck me if these girls that blow her out the water looks wise are fucking me she should probably be fucking me also that s how their brains work my i g games for me now once i exchange i gs with these host most of the game i have to run is already over and done with if you don t have a good social media its ok as long as its enough she can judge that you won t be a weird beta stalker murderer type of person and exchanging social media is not even required the only thing required for this game to work is commonalities and good sex which will make her fall in love it s pretty weird letting random people stay the night with you so you want to do everything possible to calm her nerves before you actually book her place and meet her me even being a man would be creeped out letting random people i know nothing about stay with me just let her get to know you a little by letting her also stalk your social media while you stalk hers arrival what to do on day one game her like a normal club slut the first thing you need to do is just relax and game her like she is a normal club girl fucking these airbnb host will be the easiest lay of your life you don t need to trip about it it s such an easy guaranteed lay because it s perfect logistics you both are temporary living together no matter what you do you know you will be seeing her again and that sex will happen because there are no logistical cock blocks no drunk friends no lost cell phone no fat friends that want to get food no waiting for uber rides nobody around to even judge her or find out about you two hooking up none of the bullshit the logistics are going to be seamless every night what happens when you leave people of the opposite sex in the same box for a couple days they will eventually fuck because why not all it takes is for you both to be up at at night drinking wine watching netflix in the living room and it just happens so just run your normal game don t switch anything up but in case you learned game the wrong way i m going to break down the only game techniques you need to be doing this is not going to be a full game breakdown because that is not the nature of this post you should already know this part this is a refresher and how i game exactly introductions off the open the first thing you want to do when you meet is assume formality act like you have known her for years to do this just act over excited and give her a hug off the open give her good energy come off as extrovert over exaggerate all your actions and responses break rapport breaking rapport is what sparks attraction they can be negs push pulls disqualification or something as simple as you being in good shape and pre selection the point of breaking rapport is to get her to qualify herself answer your questions as detailed as possible build attraction and to punish non investment compliance i m going to give you some examples from my own game using these techniques the topic i will be breaking rapport about will be her hair to demonstrate how each technique is different using the same topic neg a neg is anything that makes her feel insecure and feels a negative low value emotion about herself why isn t your hair done right now with a disgusted tone she s going to have to qualify about how she was lazy which is low value and that it s usually doesn t look like this it calls out a dlv about herself and forces her to explain qualify it away which is investment which is what you want and how you know it s working and that your breaks in rapport hits push pull a push pull is a negative and positive comment observation in the same sentence love hate push pull icy hot sweet spicy omg i love that hairstyle on you pull yeah i almost couldn t tell that s its horse hair push most hot girls have fake hair their called extensions by white girls and weaves by the minority chicks it s a big thing in the female hairstyle community that most of the extensions are not human hair but animal hair this is a good line because she s spent a lot of time and effort on her hair but your also breaking rapport that you know it s not her real hair it makes her qualify that it s not horsehair or that it s actually her real hair it s not about the line or it being correct it s about getting her to qualify after you say the line disqualification disqualification is telling her all the reasons why you two could never be together hows she s not good enough for you and doesn t meet your standards again what s the point of breaking rapport to trigger investment aka qualification she has to defend and qualify herself to you in order to save face see this is why we are only ever going to be just friends you know i don t fuck i mean date blonde girls she s going to qualify about how she usually has brunette hair and is about to dye it again the more you disqualify the more she is going to seek your validation she s going to seek your approval she s going to crave wanting to live up to your standards she s going to brag qualify and want to jump through the hoops you have laid out for her giving these examples you should be able to come up with your own now about any topic you can think of break rapport about the future date you guys are going to go on for the day date example again going back to hiking if that s what you plan the date to be break rapport about how she won t be able to keep up with you how you know a better spot how her clothing attire is not the best how you could beat her in a race across the trail she s not in shape enough etc you want her selling you on the date and proving to you why you guys need to go do it together by breaking rapport about the future date proving you wrong becomes the reason for the date once you have the minimum requirement for attraction stop breaking rapport and only break rapport now from that point on to punish non investment compliance where you ask her a question she gives you a low investment answer like a simple yes no idk maybe one sentence reply every question you ask she should be replying for mins straight just talking your ear off creating attraction once you have it reaches a point where you can no longer build any more it s like a bucket full of water once it reaches its capacity you can t fill it up any more it just spills and is a waste don t be the guy that never stops breaking rapport that s bad game the amount of attraction you will need to fuck your host is like a out of a again this will be the easiest lay in your life building rapport aka creating comfor t comfort is what you should really be focusing on unlike attraction you can t have too much comfort in order to get this woman to let you live with her rent free for mouths you re going to need an over abundance of comfort it needs to feel like she has known you her whole life when it s only been a couple of days that is the effect you need to create you do this by focusing on comfort you want to become her best friend her confidant her therapist just like attraction techniques there are comfort techniques that i will break down for you these are the only ones you should worth using commonalities people always ask the question and want to know what to talk about with a women the answer should be any topic of conversation you can build commonality off of future projections future projections are you talking about doing something together in the future like a date vacation what you re going to do together later in the night etc you can also use future projections about a potential future relationship you two may or may not have example future project making her your girlfriend wife having kids where you two are going to move etc rewarding when ever you ask a qualifier and she gives you investment you want to reward her investment by telling her how amazing that it is that she does xyz how fucking cool that s she s from xyx and how you want to hear more about it it s giving her permission to qualify more you reward investment and it makes them invest more you ask a question and you want her to keep talking simply say why how so or tell me more and she will talk your ear off about whatever question you asked her example omg it s so awesome that you go hiking because xyz keep it up tell me more say tell me more or simply just ask a follow up question it s during the rewarding phase that you usually would build a commonality and do any other comfort techniques love bomb love bombing is how you get women addicted to you love bombing is emotional heroin love bombing is a bunch of different comfort techniques in one and it s on steroids you want to overload her with validation about everything and anything tell her she s the best at xyz comfort her on her insecurities how special and different she is from all the other women always taking her side rewarding her good behavior and investment you want to install a god complex into her love bombing is flattery it s creating a sense of destiny building up her self esteem love bombing is complete acceptance of her you don t see any flaws she can do no wrong shes the fucking best ever at everything drama game drama game is what it sounds like you want to create drama about anything that you can think of love bombing as the pull and drama game as the push drama is basically starting little arguments with the point of eventually resolving it and making your bond stronger drama is the reason make up sex is so much better and emotionally charged fighting and making up is very addicting to women even if it doesn t end with sex the point of drama game is to just basically make a woman feel a wide variety of positive and negative emotions in a quick span give her emotional whiplash i routinely start fights with women about stupid shit because i know if i don t create the drama she will and i rather be in control and on the offensive instead of reacting and being on the defensive women need drama or they get bored and create it themselves they always need to be feeling a wide range of positive and negative emotions i also don t have to start the fights but instead do something that will make her start the fight example tell a plate she can spend the night at my place for the first time but at the last second cancel with her and have another plate spend the night while posting about it on social media plate number is going to be crying and pissed and jealous and will hit you up and cuss your ass out over the phone deal with that for a bit than love bomb her and make up the next time you see her you will have the greatest sex you have ever had with her start small fights with your host about anything you possibly can drama is the reason women stay with abusive men its because women are addicted to the emotions drama creates and the constant fighting and making up it s actually called trauma in the psychological community and its what bonds a women to you for life this is how you form alpha widows you form alpha windows by giving a women a wide range of emotions that she just can t get from a beta male because beta males care too much about her and don t want to hurt her it s not actually you as a person that alpha widows a woman but the positive and negative emotions you make her feel understand this women are like muscles you need to break them down with drama game and destroy them psychologically than build them back up using love bombing for the relationship to reform stronger then ever just like muscles your relationships will be stronger each time you use love bombing and drama game together break them down and build them back up again all your relationships if you self inspect have both of these it s just instead of it being random you are deliberately creating it yourself all relationships that don t have drama and love bombing are doomed to fail it s when the emotions you make her feel stop that her hypergamy kicks in and starts searching for a man to make her feel them again this is the exact method people with bpd use to get people hooked to them it creates an endless cycle that women can never escape from don t leave this part of relationships to chance artificially create it finding out her logistics you should be finding out your host logistics as soon as possible find out what her plans are for the week what time she starts and gets off work what does she usually do after work you want to find out the answer to these questions so you can better plan your time with her to know when she s free to hang out fuck you don t want to end up surprised when her friends come over or something to cock block all your plans at the last minute here are the logistical questions you should be asking in every interaction you have not just only with your bnb host who are you here with how do you know each other what area do you stay in what hotel are you staying at do you have roommates are your friends here your roommates how did you get here how are you getting home what are you doing tomorrow later tonight this week what time do you start and get off work what do you usually do after work what time is your lunch break of course use the questions that apply to whatever situation you are in you wouldn t ask your bnb host about her having roommates when you already know she doesn t setting up the day date ideally you set up the date the next day about a commonality that you two found so for example you both like a certain kind of food and you do a future projection about having brunch over it tomorrow or you both like hiking future projection she has to show you the trails for tomorrow get her agreeing to the date before hand my personal favorites are brunch hiking and photo shoots brunch because it s socially acceptable to day drink during brunch and we all know how good of an excuse even one drop of alcohol gives women permission to act like sluts and have an excuse for it just happened pull her back and rail her out hiking because i already know the trails i enjoy it i get to see her with practically no clothes on hot and sweaty with smeared make up and i know the secluded locations of the trail to fuck her outside she thinks she s showing me this trail for the first time n all i already go there all the time you can fuck in her car you can fuck in bathrooms you can fuck on the trail and when you get back fuck her in the shower it s a date that naturally flows into wild adventures sex than flows into more sex because we have to go home and take a shower from the hiking and the sex to help give her that plausible deniability since you really can t use alcohol i just use weed joint or vape since it s more healthy when your about to do a cardio activity being high outdoors and connecting with a new person is just an amazing feeling she s not a whore for fucking me on the trail it was the weed photo shoots because nothing makes a women get loose and lose all inhibition quite like a camera her place should already be nice so it makes a great shooting location have some music and liquor on hand you don t have to leave her place to have the date it can be done at any time of the day it also transitions nicely into sex and making a sex tape i mean the cams already on i get to dictate what she wears tell her and force her into poses say a couple magic lines to turn it to a nude photo shoot the transition into sex is just so seamless and effortless doing a photo shoot date do not fuck her on day after you get her agreeing with the date leave her alone and go do whatever else you have planned for the day you don t want to telegraph you really want to fuck her that night it will make everything to obvious and kill the romance plot line she should be masturbating to you during the night thinking about your date tomorrow this is important to have her insinuate and think of all the things you can do and what it would be like to have you around living with her long term and how crazy and dirty it is to fuck her guest you want her mind to be on you all night you fucking her on day stops all this from happening it s boring and it kills the seduction let her soak in her juices for the night build more pre selection this is something i like to do just because i m a little twisted and like stacking the cards in my favor at all times as soon as i m done and befriended set up the date with the host i ll go out and do some day game my goal being to pull and fuck this new girl from day game while the host is home introduce them than fuck her loud my goal is to have my host chick fantasizing about me all night demonstrates even more pre selection but this time in real life instead of instagram she needs to know exactly what type of guy i am before we become involved do the same thing during the night go to the club pull and fuck your club girl loud and time it so you can kick her out when host chick is making breakfast chilling in the living room so she sees her choose one whatever works better for her schedule to see the girl you pulled if i fail to pull a girl i ll just invite one of my other plates over to fuck and let her think i pulled this girl and i just met her you don t have to do this it s optional eliciting her motivations in life and solving them with value arbitrage this is my secret sauce right here this is how i can get away with crazy behavior and not let it affect my social circles it s how i can get away with anything without facing consequences everybody is my life i offer them more value then i take everybody is indebted to me i own them when you hear about nurturing dependence this is how you do it eliciting motivations is finding out people s hopes wants dreams and ambitions through strategic questioning that have them telling you all the ways you your connections can help them achieve it you want to become such a net positive in somebody s life they can t afford to lose you when people talk about vague bullshit like offering value this is the brass tacks of what they actually mean this is basically a sells technique weaponized to help people so you can climb social circles pimps also use something similar when they turn women out they find out what they are missing in life and offer it to her in exchange for her very soul using this technique you can get anything you want out of anybody you just need to help them first and in return they help you get what you want exchange of social currency example you meet a cocktail waitress and befriend her you find out her motivations and learn she s tired of the nightlife scene and actually went to school to be a chef it s just she never got hired and she s hot so she became a cocktail waitress it just so happens you re good friends with the owner of a restaurant you simply get her talking about all the ways her working and actually using whatever her degree is all the ways her being a chef would be better then being a cocktail waitress all the ways you introducing her to your friend would be beneficial for her you re basically hooking this woman up with her dream job and in exchange you can get whatever you want from her they will always be grateful and ask about ways they can help you out just tell them and you shall receive in my case i simply want to add her to my collection i want her to no questions asked whenever i get a comp table to show up to whatever event i m throwing i need hot women so i can get free comp tables at nightclubs that s what she can do for me and she agrees so i helped her out and now she s indebted and helping me out with what i want which is to use her as eye candy so i don t have to pay thousands of dollars for vip tables at nightclubs it benefits all of us the girl gets her dream job the restaurant owner gets a chef that is vouched for by a friend i get a hot women to show up to every party and event i throw to help save me money on said event and party so with everybody you meet find out what they are missing in their lives and deliver it to them than get whatever you are after out of them you will have limitless influence and power over them and you can get whatever you re after this is how all real friendships are real friendship is helping people achieve their dreams friendship is not that you are coworkers so you hang out after work sometimes resources to learn more about this concept is the book influence by robert cialdini spin selling by niel rackham and anything rsd luke use those to start and the rabbit hole will lead you to more resources find books about social engineering and con men sex again the two most important things to make this work is building that love bombing comfort and love bombing sex the sex you want to have with your hosts needs to be the most degrading and emotional experience she has ever had sex with you needs to put her in a state of trauma your dick game needs to be better then whatever other guys she is currently fucking along with the connection she feels during it before we even discuss what exactly you need to be doing and saying during sex there is something you have to get handled before that which is improving your sexual stamina otherwise the other shit does not matter because you wont have the stamina to maintain it this is how i increased my stamina i don t cum now or should i say ejaculate unless i want to and the women is deserving doing all this i also became multi orgasmic and can have multiple female like orgasms now without even touching myself or mental stimulation full body shaking like google search and download the book the sex god method and the multi orgasmic man to learn more about all this those are the resources you want to use you need to break all her sexual boundaries that she has i ve never done this before is all you should be hearing if shes never been in a threesome you need to make that happen if shes never been fucked in the ass you need to do that if shes never took cum to the face blast that bitch if shes never been choked knock that bitch out how to last longer pc and bc kegel flex create a routine much like in the gym working out your dick muscles keep stats with the sets and reps do this for about months and you will be able to just use your muscles to hold back or shoot way more cum you need to measure your improvement in order to build positive reinforcement i personally tracked everything i made colorful graphs showing my improvement with reps and sets when i was edging i measured how far i could shoot my cum etc be as obsessed about measuring and tracking your results doing this also just makes your dick naturally harder if you have that pushing rope type of erection you need to be doing this for sure to solve that meditation and breath control dudes cum to quick because they lose control of their breath and emotions meditation solves this in order to last forever during sex no matter how fast you are jack hammering you need to breath exactly like you are meditating your mind needs to be empty again create drills and track your progress with meditation try to work up to an hour with minimal thoughts edging when you start off with edging start off with a goal of just lasting mins with your hand jacking it than increase by a min each time tell you can make it to mins with out cuming after that increase the difficulty by edging but this time rubbing your cock instead of jacking off again start at mins with the goal making it to mins last get a flushlight and use that start off at mins make it to do all these first without porn while basically meditating than move on to doing the exact same drills but with porn if you start off with porn and the flushlight there is zero chance you will ever improve that s too much stimulation to fast cardio a big part of lasting long is breath control how can you control your breath if you have no cardio endurance you can t work your way up to being able to run at minimum miles without stopping and do lots of hitt training those blue and yellow pills when i first started doing this game i had no stamina but i instinctively knew this type of sex would be a requirement to make work so i just pop some viagra or cialus they are easy to get from a doc if you don t want a doc you can get them from any website that sells gear eventually once you mastered all the drills and you can stop using these devi dominance emotion variety and immersion are what you need for good sex this is from the book the sex god method so to learn more read the book that is your sex bible use these as pillars and come up with your own shit to do to her in the bedroom what i did was use these and come up with material every day and wrote down what i would say to her and the physical actions i would take example choking her out while looking deep in her eyes and telling her i would never hurt her i ll protect her always and keep her safe i wrote that down in evernote and the next time i had sex i used that material and did that action when you are having sex you are not going to just come up with new shit to do and say to her off the top of your dome which is why you need to come up with and write down shit before hand brainstorm than use it the best shit is mis matching doing something very dominant physically while saying something very emotional verbally and vice versa i m choking the bitch out while telling her i will never hurt it it makes no fucking sense and doesn t need to dominance choking spitting in her mouth face fucking hair pulling slapping or punching bdsm cuming on her face pissing on her gagging on your cock tell she vomits emotion body to body contact non stop eye contact love bombing words variety fuck her outside fuck her in the bedroom role play different fantasy s every time you have sex fuck in different rooms immersion what i found creates immersion is role playing non stop eye contact and all distractions like tv and cell phone out of sight and out of mind no upcoming appointments her schedule needs to be free she needs comfort so don t go too far and hurt her or that will break immersion example doing some crazy bdsm shit like whipping her with a belt will hurt and the pain will distract her breaking immersion though it can also add to immersion sometimes also come up with a bunch of things to say and actions for devi and apply it porn star modeling something else i did after reading the sex god method was to find a male porn star and copy steal everything they say did to jump start on creating material i personally choose james deen i feel like he s one of the few male porn stars that use devi most male porn stars are boring as fuck they don t say anything and just jackhammer bitches opposite of what you need to be doing for good sex you need to fucking talk and be expressive not a mime with a dick after you fuck the rest of the days just keep doing and using every technique i talked about over and over again tell slightly before the check out date game her and fuck her everyday make more commonalities do more future projections just keep pouring it on ask her deep comfort questions that get her telling you about her childhood and any trauma that she experienced get her to tell you all her secrets shit even her family and best friends don t know about if you use my verbal structure this is very easy just reward investment and break rapport and try again when she gives you a low investment answer eventually she will break and tell you want you want to know endgame so after you do all this shit for days however long it s time to get what you are after a free place to live this is how you spring it on her after sex say something like this tell her how you feel like you two have something special and you wish you could stay longer how it s not fair that you two met and have to get pulled apart how you really enjoy her and the city and thinking about moving there she will just offer to let you stay and makes jokes about you being able to repay her some other way that s it say some shit how you two have something there and she will feel it to and how she s the only woman you can open up with this shit right here is chick crack shit like how s it s destiny you two were supposed to meet each other supposed to be together you have so much in common congrats you now live in the best part of your city rent free and you got some free on demand pussy to go along with it from here on out it s a whole other post on how to manage the relationship from this point on but keep separate bedrooms for sure and sometimes spend the night at your own house or some other women s just because you moved in with her does not mean you actually have to live with her non stop if shes hot teach her game and turn her into a female pua go out to clubs and pick up women together all women are bi this also goes along with the whole breaking her comfort zone and i never done this before sexual experience if she s older with money play house and get her to buy you shit use her for whatever she s good at recap so to recap this is how you get a free place to live make an airbnb account and run social media recon on your target have your profile mirror hers exchange social media game her like a normal club girl make her fall in love with drama and love bombing make her feel a sense of destiny and that you two were supposed to meet and be together using a bunch of commonalities give her very dominant and emotional sex keep doing all this for the duration of your stay before you check out date tell her some bullshit like you would like to stay longer and that you feel something for her there is something there
16241,introduction this article is the second part of a part series part discussed why a man s purposes are the most important things in his life and why they also bring him the most pleasure part also discussed how a man s confidence pushes him towards his purposes and anxiety pushes him away from his purposes part will discuss how a woman s attraction to a man is centered on his purposes which in turn create his emotional experience and his reality part will discuss how a man can manage his ego to maximize the pleasure he receives from pursuing his purposes and minimize his anxiety what are women attracted to most men cannot answer a simple yet extremely important question what exactly is it about men that women are sexually and romantically attracted to most men would say that women are attracted to good looks height a big dick social status money and cool stuff like cars and houses obviously women find these things attractive but it is clear that these things by themselves are not enough to build real sustained attraction over the long term sometimes men say that women are attracted to men who are alpha confident intelligent nice or have a good personality but those answers are usually not helpful because they just create deeper questions what exactly does it mean to be alpha confident nice or intelligent all of these answers contain some truth but miss the primary thing women are attracted to the most attractive aspect of a man to a woman is the emotional experience he enjoys what he enjoys not what she enjoys women obviously also want to experience positive emotions but there is a hard ceiling on how awesome a woman s emotional experience can be which is why she prefers to enjoy the man s emotional experience vicariously through him as if she was experiencing his reality through his emotions it s a bizarre quirk of human nature and the strangeness of this concept is why most men completely misunderstand women by emotional experience i mean the totality of the emotions a person experiences from your lowest emotions your desire to eat shit and scratch your butt to the highest emotions your desire to learn about the universe have deep relationships with people and venture into the unknown the pinnacle of an attractive emotional experience is the pleasure that comes from pursuing desirable purposes what i call journey pleasure and not the feeling of actually consuming the fruits of the journey destination pleasure it is the difference between journey and destination pleasure that most men do not understand and why they think they can attract women by buying them things or doing them favors to create an attractive emotional experience for yourself you must have confidence which is the feeling that you can easily make progress towards your goals and that nothing can stand in your way confidence is the firepower you need to feel journey pleasure and is essentially the feeling that you can get whatever you want whenever you want nothing can stop you and that you are pursuing the best possible thing you can be pursuing anxiety is the opposite of confidence and occurs when your subconscious mind feels like there may be a better purpose you could be pursuing and your journey to your current purpose might be thwarted because of threats or obstacles on the way because confidence is the primary ingredient for an attractive emotional experience it is the most important trait women look for in men women can also pursue desirable purposes and feel journey pleasure but their ability to do so is greatly hindered by the fact that they naturally feel much more anxiety than men which means they naturally feel less confidence which is why they prefer to vicariously feel a confident man s journey pleasure which is stronger and more consistent than hers having anxiety is like living in a physical and psychological prison that cripples you when trying to pursue things you want and makes you a slave of what others think of you which is why women want to psychically step out of their own body and fly on the alpha male s wings in addition humans did not evolve in a world with police guns or jails so women have a strong constant emotional need for an alpha male to keep them safe and hunt down future resources for them outside of the tribe s territory even though these emotions make less rational sense in the modern world women still have those emotions and are still strongly attracted to confident men who hunt down desirable targets the larger more difficult and more desirable the purposes you pursue the more attractive you become to provide an attractive emotional experience for women a man must create an attractive emotional experience for himself first which requires him to insist on following his own purposes rather than the purposes of others holding frame is the alpha male s insistence that his purposes are the correct ones a man does not hold frame by forcing his purposes on others but rather by sticking to his purposes with laser focus and only paying people attention who help him pursue those purposes and if a woman chooses not to pursue the alpha male s purposes that is her loss she is just stupid it may sound counter intuitive but the more of your thoughts and emotions you dedicate to your own fun and following your own purposes the more she will feel attracted because your selfishness causes you to enjoy a superior emotional experience which will in turn allow her to vicariously experience a superior emotional experience the feeling projected by an alpha male and the feeling that betas wish to vicariously experience is the feeling mike tyson feels when he knocks out his opponent when eddie van halen rips a guitar solo in front of thousands of screaming fans when firefighters walk into the burning world trade center on when elon musk invents some new technology that changes the world or when michael jordan hits the game winning shot and cry tears of joy as he hugs the championship trophy afterwards people enjoy watching those men in action because they place themselves in the shoes of those men and feel the confidence power and ultimately joy of those men vicariously through them as they purpose their grand purposes because those men have cultivated the conquering emotion with regard to the at least one of their primary purposes they can also carry around that emotion to other aspects of their lives which is why people like being around somebody like mike tyson even when he is doing something mundane like eating dinner or going bowling but even those great men sometimes sacrifice their own emotional experience to make women happy and lose the thing that is most attractive about them each of the men i mentioned in this paragraph is or has been considered one of the top alpha males in society but each has also been treated like shit and taken advantage of by women for acting beta to create an attractive emotional experience you must consciously and rationally determine your purposes rather than let your emotions or other people determine your purposes you must also order and prioritize your purposes correctly so that each purpose has the correct amount of space and importance in your thoughts and emotions and most importantly you must feel like your purposes are correct such that doubt and anxiety do not cause you to deviate from them the universe is constantly trying to distract you from your purposes and you must stand steadfast in the face of these distractions especially if they come from women women evolved to carefully analyze mens thoughts and emotions and can often determine what your purposes are when even you cannot and the moment they suspect the hunt is compromised and you are being distracted even by them they start looking elsewhere your purposes create your reality so when a woman adopts your purposes and your leadership she enjoys your reality as if she stepped into a virtual reality game where you are the hero a woman who emotionally invests in an alpha male often acts like a little child in an amusement park because her reality is a constant joyful adventure towards desirable goals with nothing to fear or be anxious about the world is a beautiful place but most people live in a miserable reality because they feel like there are obstacles to the things they want but those obstacles melt away in the alpha male s reality which is why people want and should want to live in his reality rather than their own women obsessed with an alpha male often compare it to a religious experience because being in his presence makes her feel like she in a higher reality where there is complete abundance joy and no anxiety anybody can create an appealing emotional experience for themselves for a short time a nine year old girl can snort a line of cocaine or buy a ticket to disneyland the challenge however is to sustain that emotional experience in the face of potential threats and distractions so that you continue feeling joyful and confident no matter what anybody else does or says to you and no matter what happens to you it is this solidity immovability and ability to draw boundaries to protect their emotional experience that women are seeking in men they want to make sure the virtual reality game they have stepped into is safe and free from threats and to check if you have this solidity women will try to attack and destroy your emotional experience from every angle to see if you can continue to maintain a joyful emotional experience if she can destroy your emotional experience then she will feel like anybody can furthermore humans evolved to view reality as a battle of wills and a struggle for power in the dominance hierarchy so if your word is not law in your reality then somebody else s word is law and if your word is not law then she will subconsciously feel like you cannot pursue your purposes which means that you cannot guarantee an enjoyable emotional experience to vicariously experience your emotional experience a woman must feel accepted by you in fact the desire for acceptance by the alpha male is one of the strongest human emotions because without acceptance by the alpha male we are left in the jungle alone with no protection but women evolved to only feel accepted by the alpha male after they positively contribute to his emotional experience this means she must take meaningful steps to gain your validation and only afterwards can you provide it to her if you try to accept a woman when she has done nothing to deserve it she will either feel like you are not really the alpha male or that your acceptance is fake you must protect the quality of your emotional experience with your life because women are attracted to you because of your emotional experience so if she can ruin your emotional experience not only will your reality be less enjoyable she will lose attraction to you the predominant emotion in an attractive emotional experience is joy joy is the emotion women are attracted to because it is the culmination of all of the other emotions coming together in a harmonious and satisfied way a man feels true joy when his lower desires purposes are satiated so he can focus his thoughts and emotions on venturing into the unknown to transcend his current reality and create a superior future reality for himself and others think about the most fun you have ever had you weren t worried about you had enough food or shelter or money or that somebody was going to kick your ass so you could focus your thoughts and emotions on your highest purposes your sense of wonder your sense of curiosity your sense of adventure your sense of accomplishing something valuable that is joy because the alpha male is uniquely suited to feel joy and to spread that joy to others he is uniquely attractive it may sound cheesy or gay to say that the pinnacle of an attractive emotional experience is joy most people think of an alpha male as serious angry aggressive stoic or mean certainly the alpha male must be able to embody those traits when necessary but the ultimate reason for deploying those traits is to obtain joy similarly the purpose of money status material things and everything else is ultimately to feel joy it is a sign of the beta ization of our society that the ideal man is depicted as gloomy aloof angry or hard throughout most of history a real man has been portrayed as a simple dullard who works his ass off and sacrifices his own enjoyment for others that man is not the alpha male he works for the alpha male the ideal emotional experience the ideal emotional experience for a man to experience depends on three primary factors each of which depends on the others first you must feel safely warmly and permanently accepted into the tribe as if there is no chance you will ever be rejected the alpha male is the top ranking member of the tribe so not only is his status unquestioned he can reject others at his discretion which means that everybody must follow his lead or suffer rejection second because you enjoy a privileged position in the tribe you have privileged access to all of the tribe s resources including food money sex and anything else you could ever want in the ideal emotional experience you are a member of the perfect tribe which means that the tribe has everything and anything a person could ever want or need third because you control all the tribe s resources and can give orders to the rest of the members of the tribe you can focus on doing what is most pleasurable to you or anybody else confidently venturing into the unknown to defeat challenges obtain new resources and create a superior future reality for yourself and others into the tribe i call this pleasure journey pleasure if you can induce these three emotional states in yourself you can feel like the alpha male and you will act accordingly inducing this emotional state however is difficult and may require meditation study self analysis therapy successful accomplishments of goals and other spiritual work to make matters worse even if you induce this emotional state in yourself for a short while it is always liable to be wrecked if you are faced with a difficult challenge if you are rejected by somebody by biological factors etc you need therefore a way to quickly bring yourself back up to emotional speed especially if you are mid interaction with a girl i discuss how to induce this emotional state later in this article and in part of this series journey pleasure is the highest pleasure humans can feel because from an evolutionary perspective the most important thing an archaic human being could do was to venture outside of the tribe s territory kill enemies and hunt down animals for food everything about a human being s body and mind was designed for hunting and we feel our highest pleasure when hunting a resource rich target the power of this emotion is even apparent in modern society most popular sports involve defeating some kind of rival sometimes in physical combat and hurling a projectile into some kind of goal the plot of almost every movie and play involves a man defeating a challenge to get some resource and usually the resource is a beautiful woman because journey pleasure is the strongest and most exciting pleasure a human can experience i believe it is also the raw unfiltered thing that women are most attracted to a man who has achieved these three primary prongs has fulfilled all his emotional wants and needs so he can feel the highest emotion of all joy joy is the feeling that we are making continuous progress into the unknown to fulfill our desires in novel ways and we can only feel joy when our lower desires are satiated when a man perceives obstacles on his path he feels anxiety so joy requires feeling that any obstacle can be overcome that is why at least at the very beginning of every interaction with a woman you must exude unfettered joy even if there is something negative and shitty you can talk about don t the most powerful thing you can provide her is positivity an extravert by the way is just a person whose subconscious mind naturally feels positive emotion in social situations because it feels like it can get the things it wants from the interaction and in general conversely an introvert feels negative emotions neuroticism in social situations because it feels like the paths to the things it wants are blocked by threats psychologists define happiness as just extraversion minus neuroticism people who are energetic and excited in social situations feel like they have a clear path to the things they want from other people whereas people that are timid low energy and feel drained by social situations feel like other people represent a threat to them that they cannot overcome your challenge is to be able to trick your subconscious mind into feeling that the paths to the things it wants are open just like an alpha male would feel to do this you must build an inner world that you can use to delude your subconscious mind into feeling these emotions if you are tall rich famous and women throw themselves at you your outer world will cause your subconscious mind to create these emotions but if your outer world is not there yet you can use your inner world to trick your subconscious mind into producing the right emotional experience i discuss how to do this in part of this series venturing into the unknown journey pleasure is strongest when one ventures into the unknown because it is wired into our genes to understand that all new resources must come from the unknown if we stay within the confines of the tribe we will only have access to the existing resources all existing resources will eventually be consumed the unknown however provokes deep anxiety within humans because it is full of potential threats and it is full of infinitely appealing paths so it is not clear which path one should take the individual best equipped to venture into the unknown is the alpha male because he is the most capable both physically and emotionally of overcoming threats and he can provide certainty to himself and others that he is on the right path evolution determined that the tribe will be more successful if it ventures into the unknown and faces threats as a unit rather than as a set of individuals each doing their own thing because the alpha male is most capable of venturing into the unknown evolution wires betas to follow and obey the alpha male to let the alpha male lead the way and to give the alpha male superior access to the resources of the tribe in return the alpha male provides the betas protection from the dangers of the unknown and resources in proportion to what they have contributed to the tribe the most important resources the alpha male provides however are two meta resources protection and the ability to venture into the unknown to go get more resources these meta resources are much more important than any other resource which is why women are not impressed with guys who buy them things they don t care that you can give them a banana they want the man they feel can protect their current banana stash from thieves and get them infinite future bananas in the future anxiety causes us to freeze and slowly gather information about the unknown until we see a clear path through this is partly why anxiety causes you to ruminate so much however sometimes the additional information is just not there and you need to jump into the unknown with wild abandon only the alpha male has the emotional fortitude to jump into the unknown like this because he has more testosterone than anybody else testosterone is the chemical that makes men competitive and want to do wild reckless things it is usually dangerous to do wild reckless things but sometimes when facing the unknown that is your only option you can think of the tribe s territory as a physical place surrounded by boundaries these boundaries are invisible enforced by the emotions of the apes in the tribe but the betas often instantiate their emotions in the physical world by actually building physical boundaries or walls evolution keeps the betas within these walls by making them feel strong anxiety whenever they even think of leaving the territory to venture into the unknown at the same time evolution causes betas to want to obey and follow the alpha male using a carrot and a stick the carrot is that venturing into the unknown is the most emotionally appealing thing a person can do so betas can enjoy that experience vicariously through the alpha male oftentimes a beta fuses his own mission so deeply with the alpha male s mission that he loses his own identity and just sees himself or herself as an appendage of the alpha male the stick is that beta evolved to feel crippling anxiety whenever they feel they might do something that would upset or offend the alpha male the alpha male decides who is accepted or rejected by the tribe so if the betas do not play their role the alpha male can reject them leaving them in the jungle alone and unprotected humans also emotionally conceptualize the walled territory abstractly a human is just an ape that can think abstractly your comfort zone is essentially the walled territory and you conceptualize everything outside of your comfort zone as the unknown if you leave your comfort zone you feel anxiety whether it involves getting a new job getting a promotion at your current job moving to a new city approaching a woman at a bar or even exploring a new idea that contradicts ideas you are comfortable with humans are resistant to change because it makes them feel like they have left the territory where they are safe and protected by the alpha male this is why feminists often demand that men encourage give courage to women to do things that women traditionally have not done when interacting with a woman you must read her and determine what her walled territory is in other words figure out who she is then you excite her and build attraction by leading her out of the walled territory into the unknown in a controlled way for example if she is interested in philosophy you can build attraction by having a conversation with her about philosophy that is slightly beyond what she can do normally by herself if she has a stupid opinion about philosophy you can challenge it but do it in such a way that she continues to feel accepted by you the last thing you want to do is pull her into the unknown and make her feel abandoned there humans become bored the moment there is no unknown left to explore the desire for the unknown is why people want what they cannot have and why the grass is greener on the other side it is also why a woman married to successful businessman will fantasize about slumming it with broke rappers and why people with nice houses with big lawns and beautiful kids have mid life crises the desire for the unknown is the source of all human innovation and creativity but it can also lead to insanity and useless wandering down meaningless and dangerous paths worst of all the desire for the unknown can lead to serious problems in relationships as we will discuss later in this article practically speaking you can venture into the unknown by creating art consuming art learning stuff overcoming your own limitations through self improvement solving problems in your life being curious growing in your career or just walking through the world with an open mind and absorbing everything in social situations with a woman you can venture into the unknown by engaging in challenging interesting conversations where you both learn something and or solve some problem together consuming mind expanding art exploring a city together violating social norms with respect to behavior and opinions in a good way having new experiences like trying new food challenging each other by making fun of each other playing competitive games with and against each other engaging in some kind of self improvement together etc you fail to venture into the unknown by having boring mundane conversations by focusing on your lower pleasures like eating and video games by letting her take the lead and take the conversation into boring and stupid territory by doing mundane repetitive things that she has done a million times and by acting fearful and anxious if you talk dress and act like every other guy and hold a series of narrow minded and conformist opinions and show a strong fear of doing anything that violates social norms or her rules you will not represent the unknown to her to remain on the cusp of the unknown you must remain dynamic and be constantly ready to change the subject of conversation leave the situation or suggest that you and her go somewhere else and or do something else or just do and say anything that pops into your head that will make the interaction fun for you again there is no rulebook for how to do this you must do what is fun for you at that moment whatever it is if you feel the interaction dying or slowing down or becoming boring it is your responsibility to do something to make it fun again most guys let interactions go to shit just because they are happy to be in the presence of a hot girl if your only option is to leave her it is better to do that than to suffer through a shitty emotional experience once she sees that you are willing to defend your emotional experience at all costs she will be more attracted to you more willing to emotionally invest in you and more willing to let you take the lead the next time you come back and give her a second chance ordering your emotions the ideal emotional experience is a pyramid where the less important emotions eating fucking staying warm support the higher and more important emotions hanging out with your friends expanding yourself intellectually accomplishing goals the less important an emotion the less precedence and time you give to them the pinnacle of this pyramid the purpose that all lower purposes support is venturing into the unknown to pursue the ultimate transcendent purpose the ultimate transcendent purpose is the creation of a future reality that is infinitely better than the current reality in every way it is an impossible goal which means that you will never run out of journey pleasure as you pursue it the alpha male has perfect abundance which means that he can fulfill his lower emotions at any time his attitude towards lower pleasures is yes i enjoy sleeping eating and fucking but i can get those things whenever i want so i don t worry or even think about them because his desires are ordered correctly and he can fulfill them whenever he wants the alpha male consistently feels a calm disinterested almost humorous satiation and contentment about most things the same way you feel most of the time about cheeseburgers the only desire of the alpha male that is not satiated is the feeling of venturing into the unknown which is fine because venturing into the unknown is our highest purpose human beings innately know what the ideal emotional experience is and we just feel right when our emotions are correctly prioritized unfortunately most people cannot maintain this prioritization because they feel scarcity so they place that particular desire at the top of the pyramid obviously many men feel scarcity with respect to sex so they put sex at the top of their pyramid putting sex or any other lower desire at the top of your pyramid is unattractive to women for several reasons you are no longer focusing on venturing into the unknown to pursue grand purposes which is the most fun thing you can be doing so your emotional experience now sucks you are showing that you are not satiated with respect to your lower desires which means that your emotional experience sucks if you were around a guy who was constantly talking and thinking about eating food and was constantly desperate to eat you would think he was either starving or mentally ill in either case you would not want his emotional experience eating food is great but it is objectively not the highest part of your emotional experience women evolved to constantly scan your thoughts and emotions to to figure out what your emotional experience is to determine whether it is worth vicariously experiencing women can therefore sense if your emotions are ordered properly if not they lose attraction when women complain about the men in their life they usually complain that the guy is over prioritizing some purpose the woman thinks is stupid like video games they also complain that the man is not ambitious enough which is code for his highest purpose is not impressing me there is nothing wrong with desiring sex discussing sex with women and even telling a woman you want to fuck her in fact women want a man who is confident and in control of his desires and lose interest if you try to present yourself as a harmless asexual dork but sexual desire becomes creepy when wrongly prioritized creepiness is just emotional over investment in a particular emotion and you over invest in something when you place it in the wrong place in the hierarchy of your emotional experience if somebody spent more than hours a day worrying about how good his shits were you would think he was creepy therefore when you talk about sex you should talk about it as if it had the same importance and emotional weight and importance as eating lunch i used to wonder why women only wanted to have sex at the end of the night why can t we have sex at the beginning of the date and go out to dinner and a movie after why do i need to have a conversation with you and pretend like it is interesting like most guys i assumed that women would not have sex with you until you proved that you liked them and you prove you like a woman by doing things for them like buying them dinner or listening to their bullshit the real explanation is actually much weirder and more interesting women do not want to have sex until the end of the night because women want to have sex with the alpha male and to the alpha male sex is a relatively low priority activity almost an afterthought the archetypal alpha male goes out has a fun night and then has sex as dessert almost like masturbating before bed a man who just wants sex is beta because he is willing to spend time with a woman who contributes nothing to his emotional experience because so many men overvalue sex and because women know that most men overvalue sex when discussing sex you should be careful to pull the conversation back to higher things occasionally to show that you are not a needy monster that just wants to put his dick into something women s access to your joy women want to experience the alpha male s emotional experience including and most importantly his joy women want to feel like they are at the center of the tribe like they can cut through any challenge to get the things they want like they can control other people to do their bidding and most importantly like they are on a fun adventure towards a worthy goal unfortunately women cannot be the alpha male because they do not have alpha male s confidence women are about twice as prone to negative emotion than men this evolutionary curse is because women are physically weaker than men and also evolved to protect children in other words you must defeat challenges to be the alpha male and women are too afraid to confront the challenges in the unknown head on especially when those challenges are other people and especially when those challenges are men and because women cannot become the alpha male they also have a deathly fear of rejection from the tribe because they need the alpha male s protection the hottest meanest sluttiest most arrogant woman must obey and follow the alpha male because from an evolutionary perspective he can go get anything he wants and she cannot so she has to rely on him both for the things she wants and needs to survive and for the journey pleasure he feels to get there and she must act right because he can get anything he wants so he can leave and go get better looking women if she does not act right i am out of space on reddit go to my website at to read the rest
16243,what is airb amp b game this is a repeatable method i have created in order to quickly get a free place to live at my ideal logistics by fucking and making female airb amp b host fall in love

pussy to go along with your new place it s all about creating an effect where the women feels like she s known you for years with in a couple days how i came up with it i was broke and living with family with shit logistics about mins away from all the clubs i needed to improve my logistics so i could improve my game further it was too much of a hassle to pull consistently i came up with it out of necessity now i use it when i want to go on long vacations and have my main city covered at multiple locations using this do this with multiple hosts don t stop with only one like they say one hoe is close to no hoe how can you use it use it to improve your own logistics in your city or use it when you go on vacation to save money on hotels you can even just use this to straight up move to a new city you can even use most of this on normal women that you pick up off a cold approach it does not have to be a woman you stay with airbnb below ill give a breakdown on what you need to do during each step along with gaming and relationship techniques i ll go over what you need to do before hand with setting up your profile and running social media recon how to game her once you meet her the exact techniques to use and why you need to use them how to get her to fall in love fast and create that effect where she feels like she s known you forever what i m going to go over shouldn t only be used for this type of game but should be used at all times with all the women in your life pregame setting up your profile defining the logistics you are after and social media recon download and set up your profile download the app and set up your profile give as little info as you can about yourself choose a profile picture of you with a hot women to demonstrate pre selection to let the host know you are not a weirdo beta in the about me section leave it blank you will notice a lot of these female host over qualify themselves and tell you their life story in their bio when you message the host that s when you want to edit your bio and have it mirror hers example the host likes hiking and the outdoors in general and she s originally from cali before you hit her up change your bio so that it says you also like hiking and the outdoors and that you re from cali also you want the describe yourself section to mirror whatever host you plan on staying at this is why you want to leave it blank because it s always going to be changing depending on the woman you are talking to the reason you do this is because you want to build as much baseline comfort as possible before you two even meet each other it plays on creating a sense of destiny and serendipity that will be important later on you want to create an effect where it s meant to be you want the story of how you two met and fell for each other be the plot of a romance drama commonalities are a major key to making this happen most important thing define the logistics you are after the whole reason you are using airbnb game is to improve your existing logistics ask yourself and find out the best nightclubs and restaurants in your city than find the hottest or richest female host closest to those locations example you live mins away from all the action in your city and on top of that you also live with family members you have shit logistics it s hard to pull constantly because you are so far away and you really can t practice game as hard you like because its hard to pull you can t drink if you re going to save money and drive yourself there because you put yourself at risk of duis and having to pay for parking you re going to be wasting s of dollars on uber and lifts rides if you do want to drink you re going to get less sleep because of the commute to get there and back it would be so much easier if you can just walk across the street to the club right so let s use a city like phoenix az for example there are only two locations worth living in phoenix for game in tempe with all the slutty asu women and scottsdale where the bitches with money and the industry live if you search on instagram and find a hot women i mean straight universal s from az the picture is most likely taken in scottsdale those are the locations to game in so why not just use airbnb game so you can live in the area you want to spend most of your time anyways makes it easy to pull when you stay across the street from the club you can walk to the club and walk to the bars restaurants you have your dates set up for it s all about the set up and this is how you create the perfect set up by having good logistics so you would want to find the female bnb host that are in those locations scottsdale has all the nightclubs and tempe has those asu young college sluts that you can just day game both areas have high foot traffic define the type of women that you are after you also want to define the type of relationship you are going to want to pursue here are the ones i use young hot plate that i can use as a wing woman i train her to basically be a female pua to game with me and pull threesomes with older average women that have lots of money that can spoil me and be a sugar mom info you want to find out about her logistics you want a host that will be there in person handing you the keys hosts that will also be staying with you during your stay hosts that have no men in their profile pics you want single women at least women who don t live with their boyfriends you want hosts where its only going to be her and you staying for the duration no other family members or friends also staying there it should just be the two of you during the duration when you re searching for places on the app you want to filter by private room and shared room you don t want to have the whole place to yourself you also want to find out as much info about her before you pick her to stay with using social media to run recon find her facebook and i g profiles to find out the locations she visits who her friends are what she does during her free time work you want to find this information out to help with the conversations you will have with her so you know what to talk about and can create more commonalities which are very important you need to be on the lookout and trying to find as many commonalities as you can at all times the two most important things that makes this game work will be the commonalities and the love bombing sex to find her social media profiles you can search by just her name and just match her face if you can t find it that way just message her and get her number i g account using basic text game all you need to do is find a b s justification so that its not weird example you see that she likes hiking text her from the app and asks her about it ask if she has any recommendations tell her you would love to check it out and that it sounds nice and if she has any pictures you can check out and she will give you her i g account so you can view them the hiking is the justification b s that you use it can be anything just use some info from her profile is the easiest way these women are very helpful they want to be a good host and show you around the city she would love for you to be an additional follower on her page once you have the i g just find her on facebook if you get her number just type it in any social media platform and it will find her automatically for you the same goes for her email address to get her number just use another bullshit justification like the app always crashes on your phone and it would be more reliable and convenient for you guys if you just exchanged numbers instead of communicating to each other from the app in case something happens the good thing about exchanging social media with her before you even meet her is if your social media is on point with high value content it acts as a dhv it shows you have social proof to build comfort with her and pre selection by all the women on your profile if a female looks at my profile and i m surrounded by l a model s and above and they fuck me if these girls that blow her out the water looks wise are fucking me she should probably be fucking me also that s how their brains work my i g games for me now once i exchange i gs with these host most of the game i have to run is already over and done with if you don t have a good social media its ok as long as its enough she can judge that you won t be a weird beta stalker murderer type of person and exchanging social media is not even required the only thing required for this game to work is commonalities and good sex which will make her fall in love it s pretty weird letting random people stay the night with you so you want to do everything possible to calm her nerves before you actually book her place and meet her me even being a man would be creeped out letting random people i know nothing about stay with me just let her get to know you a little by letting her also stalk your social media while you stalk hers arrival what to do on day one game her like a normal club slut the first thing you need to do is just relax and game her like she is a normal club girl fucking these airbnb host will be the easiest lay of your life you don t need to trip about it it s such an easy guaranteed lay because it s perfect logistics you both are temporary living together no matter what you do you know you will be seeing her again and that sex will happen because there are no logistical cock blocks no drunk friends no lost cell phone no fat friends that want to get food no waiting for uber rides nobody around to even judge her or find out about you two hooking up none of the bullshit the logistics are going to be seamless every night what happens when you leave people of the opposite sex in the same box for a couple days they will eventually fuck because why not all it takes is for you both to be up at at night drinking wine watching netflix in the living room and it just happens so just run your normal game don t switch anything up but in case you learned game the wrong way i m going to break down the only game techniques you need to be doing this is not going to be a full game breakdown because that is not the nature of this post you should already know this part this is a refresher and how i game exactly introductions off the open the first thing you want to do when you meet is assume formality act like you have known her for years to do this just act over excited and give her a hug off the open give her good energy come off as extrovert over exaggerate all your actions and responses break rapport breaking rapport is what sparks attraction they can be negs push pulls disqualification or something as simple as you being in good shape and pre selection the point of breaking rapport is to get her to qualify herself answer your questions as detailed as possible build attraction and to punish non investment compliance i m going to give you some examples from my own game using these techniques the topic i will be breaking rapport about will be her hair to demonstrate how each technique is different using the same topic neg a neg is anything that makes her feel insecure and feels a negative low value emotion about herself why isn t your hair done right now with a disgusted tone she s going to have to qualify about how she was lazy which is low value and that it s usually doesn t look like this it calls out a dlv about herself and forces her to explain qualify it away which is investment which is what you want and how you know it s working and that your breaks in rapport hits push pull a push pull is a negative and positive comment observation in the same sentence love hate push pull icy hot sweet spicy omg i love that hairstyle on you pull yeah i almost couldn t tell that s its horse hair push most hot girls have fake hair their called extensions by white girls and weaves by the minority chicks it s a big thing in the female hairstyle community that most of the extensions are not human hair but animal hair this is a good line because she s spent a lot of time and effort on her hair but your also breaking rapport that you know it s not her real hair it makes her qualify that it s not horsehair or that it s actually her real hair it s not about the line or it being correct it s about getting her to qualify after you say the line disqualification disqualification is telling her all the reasons why you two could never be together hows she s not good enough for you and doesn t meet your standards again what s the point of breaking rapport to trigger investment aka qualification she has to defend and qualify herself to you in order to save face see this is why we are only ever going to be just friends you know i don t fuck i mean date blonde girls she s going to qualify about how she usually has brunette hair and is about to dye it again the more you disqualify the more she is going to seek your validation she s going to seek your approval she s going to crave wanting to live up to your standards she s going to brag qualify and want to jump through the hoops you have laid out for her giving these examples you should be able to come up with your own now about any topic you can think of break rapport about the future date you guys are going to go on for the day date example again going back to hiking if that s what you plan the date to be break rapport about how she won t be able to keep up with you how you know a better spot how her clothing attire is not the best how you could beat her in a race across the trail she s not in shape enough etc you want her selling you on the date and proving to you why you guys need to go do it together by breaking rapport about the future date proving you wrong becomes the reason for the date once you have the minimum requirement for attraction stop breaking rapport and only break rapport now from that point on to punish non investment compliance where you ask her a question she gives you a low investment answer like a simple yes no idk maybe one sentence reply every question you ask she should be replying for mins straight just talking your ear off creating attraction once you have it reaches a point where you can no longer build any more it s like a bucket full of water once it reaches its capacity you can t fill it up any more it just spills and is a waste don t be the guy that never stops breaking rapport that s bad game the amount of attraction you will need to fuck your host is like a out of a again this will be the easiest lay in your life building rapport aka creating comfor t comfort is what you should really be focusing on unlike attraction you can t have too much comfort in order to get this woman to let you live with her rent free for mouths you re going to need an over abundance of comfort it needs to feel like she has known you her whole life when it s only been a couple of days that is the effect you need to create you do this by focusing on comfort you want to become her best friend her confidant her therapist just like attraction techniques there are comfort techniques that i will break down for you these are the only ones you should worth using commonalities people always ask the question and want to know what to talk about with a women the answer should be any topic of conversation you can build commonality off of future projections future projections are you talking about doing something together in the future like a date vacation what you re going to do together later in the night etc you can also use future projections about a potential future relationship you two may or may not have example future project making her your girlfriend wife having kids where you two are going to move etc rewarding when ever you ask a qualifier and she gives you investment you want to reward her investment by telling her how amazing that it is that she does xyz how fucking cool that s she s from xyx and how you want to hear more about it it s giving her permission to qualify more you reward investment and it makes them invest more you ask a question and you want her to keep talking simply say why how so or tell me more and she will talk your ear off about whatever question you asked her example omg it s so awesome that you go hiking because xyz keep it up tell me more say tell me more or simply just ask a follow up question it s during the rewarding phase that you usually would build a commonality and do any other comfort techniques love bomb love bombing is how you get women addicted to you love bombing is emotional heroin love bombing is a bunch of different comfort techniques in one and it s on steroids you want to overload her with validation about everything and anything tell her she s the best at xyz comfort her on her insecurities how special and different she is from all the other women always taking her side rewarding her good behavior and investment you want to install a god complex into her love bombing is flattery it s creating a sense of destiny building up her self esteem love bombing is complete acceptance of her you don t see any flaws she can do no wrong shes the fucking best ever at everything drama game drama game is what it sounds like you want to create drama about anything that you can think of love bombing as the pull and drama game as the push drama is basically starting little arguments with the point of eventually resolving it and making your bond stronger drama is the reason make up sex is so much better and emotionally charged fighting and making up is very addicting to women even if it doesn t end with sex the point of drama game is to just basically make a woman feel a wide variety of positive and negative emotions in a quick span give her emotional whiplash i routinely start fights with women about stupid shit because i know if i don t create the drama she will and i rather be in control and on the offensive instead of reacting and being on the defensive women need drama or they get bored and create it themselves they always need to be feeling a wide range of positive and negative emotions i also don t have to start the fights but instead do something that will make her start the fight example tell a plate she can spend the night at my place for the first time but at the last second cancel with her and have another plate spend the night while posting about it on social media plate number is going to be crying and pissed and jealous and will hit you up and cuss your ass out over the phone deal with that for a bit than love bomb her and make up the next time you see her you will have the greatest sex you have ever had with her start small fights with your host about anything you possibly can drama is the reason women stay with abusive men its because women are addicted to the emotions drama creates and the constant fighting and making up it s actually called trauma in the psychological community and its what bonds a women to you for life this is how you form alpha widows you form alpha windows by giving a women a wide range of emotions that she just can t get from a beta male because beta males care too much about her and don t want to hurt her it s not actually you as a person that alpha widows a woman but the positive and negative emotions you make her feel understand this women are like muscles you need to break them down with drama game and destroy them psychologically than build them back up using love bombing for the relationship to reform stronger then ever just like muscles your relationships will be stronger each time you use love bombing and drama game together break them down and build them back up again all your relationships if you self inspect have both of these it s just instead of it being random you are deliberately creating it yourself all relationships that don t have drama and love bombing are doomed to fail it s when the emotions you make her feel stop that her hypergamy kicks in and starts searching for a man to make her feel them again this is the exact method people with bpd use to get people hooked to them it creates an endless cycle that women can never escape from don t leave this part of relationships to chance artificially create it finding out her logistics you should be finding out your host logistics as soon as possible find out what her plans are for the week what time she starts and gets off work what does she usually do after work you want to find out the answer to these questions so you can better plan your time with her to know when she s free to hang out fuck you don t want to end up surprised when her friends come over or something to cock block all your plans at the last minute here are the logistical questions you should be asking in every interaction you have not just only with your bnb host who are you here with how do you know each other what area do you stay in what hotel are you staying at do you have roommates are your friends here your roommates how did you get here how are you getting home what are you doing tomorrow later tonight this week what time do you start and get off work what do you usually do after work what time is your lunch break of course use the questions that apply to whatever situation you are in you wouldn t ask your bnb host about her having roommates when you already know she doesn t setting up the day date ideally you set up the date the next day about a commonality that you two found so for example you both like a certain kind of food and you do a future projection about having brunch over it tomorrow or you both like hiking future projection she has to show you the trails for tomorrow get her agreeing to the date before hand my personal favorites are brunch hiking and photo shoots brunch because it s socially acceptable to day drink during brunch and we all know how good of an excuse even one drop of alcohol gives women permission to act like sluts and have an excuse for it just happened pull her back and rail her out hiking because i already know the trails i enjoy it i get to see her with practically no clothes on hot and sweaty with smeared make up and i know the secluded locations of the trail to fuck her outside she thinks she s showing me this trail for the first time n all i already go there all the time you can fuck in her car you can fuck in bathrooms you can fuck on the trail and when you get back fuck her in the shower it s a date that naturally flows into wild adventures sex than flows into more sex because we have to go home and take a shower from the hiking and the sex to help give her that plausible deniability since you really can t use alcohol i just use weed joint or vape since it s more healthy when your about to do a cardio activity being high outdoors and connecting with a new person is just an amazing feeling she s not a whore for fucking me on the trail it was the weed photo shoots because nothing makes a women get loose and lose all inhibition quite like a camera her place should already be nice so it makes a great shooting location have some music and liquor on hand you don t have to leave her place to have the date it can be done at any time of the day it also transitions nicely into sex and making a sex tape i mean the cams already on i get to dictate what she wears tell her and force her into poses say a couple magic lines to turn it to a nude photo shoot the transition into sex is just so seamless and effortless doing a photo shoot date do not fuck her on day after you get her agreeing with the date leave her alone and go do whatever else you have planned for the day you don t want to telegraph you really want to fuck her that night it will make everything to obvious and kill the romance plot line she should be masturbating to you during the night thinking about your date tomorrow this is important to have her insinuate and think of all the things you can do and what it would be like to have you around living with her long term and how crazy and dirty it is to fuck her guest you want her mind to be on you all night you fucking her on day stops all this from happening it s boring and it kills the seduction let her soak in her juices for the night build more pre selection this is something i like to do just because i m a little twisted and like stacking the cards in my favor at all times as soon as i m done and befriended set up the date with the host i ll go out and do some day game my goal being to pull and fuck this new girl from day game while the host is home introduce them than fuck her loud my goal is to have my host chick fantasizing about me all night demonstrates even more pre selection but this time in real life instead of instagram she needs to know exactly what type of guy i am before we become involved do the same thing during the night go to the club pull and fuck your club girl loud and time it so you can kick her out when host chick is making breakfast chilling in the living room so she sees her choose one whatever works better for her schedule to see the girl you pulled if i fail to pull a girl i ll just invite one of my other plates over to fuck and let her think i pulled this girl and i just met her you don t have to do this it s optional eliciting her motivations in life and solving them with value arbitrage this is my secret sauce right here this is how i can get away with crazy behavior and not let it affect my social circles it s how i can get away with anything without facing consequences everybody is my life i offer them more value then i take everybody is indebted to me i own them when you hear about nurturing dependence this is how you do it eliciting motivations is finding out people s hopes wants dreams and ambitions through strategic questioning that have them telling you all the ways you your connections can help them achieve it you want to become such a net positive in somebody s life they can t afford to lose you when people talk about vague bullshit like offering value this is the brass tacks of what they actually mean this is basically a sells technique weaponized to help people so you can climb social circles pimps also use something similar when they turn women out they find out what they are missing in life and offer it to her in exchange for her very soul using this technique you can get anything you want out of anybody you just need to help them first and in return they help you get what you want exchange of social currency example you meet a cocktail waitress and befriend her you find out her motivations and learn she s tired of the nightlife scene and actually went to school to be a chef it s just she never got hired and she s hot so she became a cocktail waitress it just so happens you re good friends with the owner of a restaurant you simply get her talking about all the ways her working and actually using whatever her degree is all the ways her being a chef would be better then being a cocktail waitress all the ways you introducing her to your friend would be beneficial for her you re basically hooking this woman up with her dream job and in exchange you can get whatever you want from her they will always be grateful and ask about ways they can help you out just tell them and you shall receive in my case i simply want to add her to my collection i want her to no questions asked whenever i get a comp table to show up to whatever event i m throwing i need hot women so i can get free comp tables at nightclubs that s what she can do for me and she agrees so i helped her out and now she s indebted and helping me out with what i want which is to use her as eye candy so i don t have to pay thousands of dollars for vip tables at nightclubs it benefits all of us the girl gets her dream job the restaurant owner gets a chef that is vouched for by a friend i get a hot women to show up to every party and event i throw to help save me money on said event and party so with everybody you meet find out what they are missing in their lives and deliver it to them than get whatever you are after out of them you will have limitless influence and power over them and you can get whatever you re after this is how all real friendships are real friendship is helping people achieve their dreams friendship is not that you are coworkers so you hang out after work sometimes resources to learn more about this concept is the book influence by robert cialdini spin selling by niel rackham and anything rsd luke use those to start and the rabbit hole will lead you to more resources find books about social engineering and con men sex again the two most important things to make this work is building that love bombing comfort and love bombing sex the sex you want to have with your hosts needs to be the most degrading and emotional experience she has ever had sex with you needs to put her in a state of trauma your dick game needs to be better then whatever other guys she is currently fucking along with the connection she feels during it before we even discuss what exactly you need to be doing and saying during sex there is something you have to get handled before that which is improving your sexual stamina otherwise the other shit does not matter because you wont have the stamina to maintain it this is how i increased my stamina i don t cum now or should i say ejaculate unless i want to and the women is deserving doing all this i also became multi orgasmic and can have multiple female like orgasms now without even touching myself or mental stimulation full body shaking like google search and download the book the sex god method and the multi orgasmic man to learn more about all this those are the resources you want to use you need to break all her sexual boundaries that she has i ve never done this before is all you should be hearing if shes never been in a threesome you need to make that happen if shes never been fucked in the ass you need to do that if shes never took cum to the face blast that bitch if shes never been choked knock that bitch out how to last longer pc and bc kegel flex create a routine much like in the gym working out your dick muscles keep stats with the sets and reps do this for about months and you will be able to just use your muscles to hold back or shoot way more cum you need to measure your improvement in order to build positive reinforcement i personally tracked everything i made colorful graphs showing my improvement with reps and sets when i was edging i measured how far i could shoot my cum etc be as obsessed about measuring and tracking your results doing this also just makes your dick naturally harder if you have that pushing rope type of erection you need to be doing this for sure to solve that meditation and breath control dudes cum to quick because they lose control of their breath and emotions meditation solves this in order to last forever during sex no matter how fast you are jack hammering you need to breath exactly like you are meditating your mind needs to be empty again create drills and track your progress with meditation try to work up to an hour with minimal thoughts edging when you start off with edging start off with a goal of just lasting mins with your hand jacking it than increase by a min each time tell you can make it to mins with out cuming after that increase the difficulty by edging but this time rubbing your cock instead of jacking off again start at mins with the goal making it to mins last get a flushlight and use that start off at mins make it to do all these first without porn while basically meditating than move on to doing the exact same drills but with porn if you start off with porn and the flushlight there is zero chance you will ever improve that s too much stimulation to fast cardio a big part of lasting long is breath control how can you control your breath if you have no cardio endurance you can t work your way up to being able to run at minimum miles without stopping and do lots of hitt training those blue and yellow pills when i first started doing this game i had no stamina but i instinctively knew this type of sex would be a requirement to make work so i just pop some viagra or cialus they are easy to get from a doc if you don t want a doc you can get them from any website that sells gear eventually once you mastered all the drills and you can stop using these devi dominance emotion variety and immersion are what you need for good sex this is from the book the sex god method so to learn more read the book that is your sex bible use these as pillars and come up with your own shit to do to her in the bedroom what i did was use these and come up with material every day and wrote down what i would say to her and the physical actions i would take example choking her out while looking deep in her eyes and telling her i would never hurt her i ll protect her always and keep her safe i wrote that down in evernote and the next time i had sex i used that material and did that action when you are having sex you are not going to just come up with new shit to do and say to her off the top of your dome which is why you need to come up with and write down shit before hand brainstorm than use it the best shit is mis matching doing something very dominant physically while saying something very emotional verbally and vice versa i m choking the bitch out while telling her i will never hurt it it makes no fucking sense and doesn t need to dominance choking spitting in her mouth face fucking hair pulling slapping or punching bdsm cuming on her face pissing on her gagging on your cock tell she vomits emotion body to body contact non stop eye contact love bombing words variety fuck her outside fuck her in the bedroom role play different fantasy s every time you have sex fuck in different rooms immersion what i found creates immersion is role playing non stop eye contact and all distractions like tv and cell phone out of sight and out of mind no upcoming appointments her schedule needs to be free she needs comfort so don t go too far and hurt her or that will break immersion example doing some crazy bdsm shit like whipping her with a belt will hurt and the pain will distract her breaking immersion though it can also add to immersion sometimes also come up with a bunch of things to say and actions for devi and apply it porn star modeling something else i did after reading the sex god method was to find a male porn star and copy steal everything they say did to jump start on creating material i personally choose james deen i feel like he s one of the few male porn stars that use devi most male porn stars are boring as fuck they don t say anything and just jackhammer bitches opposite of what you need to be doing for good sex you need to fucking talk and be expressive not a mime with a dick after you fuck the rest of the days just keep doing and using every technique i talked about over and over again tell slightly before the check out date game her and fuck her everyday make more commonalities do more future projections just keep pouring it on ask her deep comfort questions that get her telling you about her childhood and any trauma that she experienced get her to tell you all her secrets shit even her family and best friends don t know about if you use my verbal structure this is very easy just reward investment and break rapport and try again when she gives you a low investment answer eventually she will break and tell you want you want to know endgame so after you do all this shit for days however long it s time to get what you are after a free place to live this is how you spring it on her after sex say something like this tell her how you feel like you two have something special and you wish you could stay longer how it s not fair that you two met and have to get pulled apart how you really enjoy her and the city and thinking about moving there she will just offer to let you stay and makes jokes about you being able to repay her some other way that s it say some shit how you two have something there and she will feel it to and how she s the only woman you can open up with this shit right here is chick crack shit like how s it s destiny you two were supposed to meet each other supposed to be together you have so much in common congrats you now live in the best part of your city rent free and you got some free on demand pussy to go along with it from here on out it s a whole other post on how to manage the relationship from this point on but keep separate bedrooms for sure and sometimes spend the night at your own house or some other women s just because you moved in with her does not mean you actually have to live with her non stop if shes hot teach her game and turn her into a female pua go out to clubs and pick up women together all women are bi this also goes along with the whole breaking her comfort zone and i never done this before sexual experience if she s older with money play house and get her to buy you shit use her for whatever she s good at recap so to recap this is how you get a free place to live make an airbnb account and run social media recon on your target have your profile mirror hers exchange social media game her like a normal club girl make her fall in love with drama and love bombing make her feel a sense of destiny and that you two were supposed to meet and be together using a bunch of commonalities give her very dominant and emotional sex keep doing all this for the duration of your stay before you check out date tell her some bullshit like you would like to stay longer and that you feel something for her there is something there
16289,introduction this article is the second part of a part series part discussed why a man s purposes are the most important things in his life and why they also bring him the most pleasure part also discussed how a man s confidence pushes him towards his purposes and anxiety pushes him away from his purposes part will discuss how a woman s attraction to a man is centered on his purposes which in turn create his emotional experience and his reality part will discuss how a man can manage his ego to maximize the pleasure he receives from pursuing his purposes and minimize his anxiety link to part link to part managing your ego i do not think it is possible to kill your ego nor do i think you should you need your ego to navigate the world to know what to focus on and what to ignore to know what to do and what not to do to differentiate between bullshit and truth and to avoid threats the goal is not to kill your ego but rather to manage it and fix it when it is wrong the most important thing to realize about your ego which literally means i in latin is that your ego is not you you are a real material living thing with objective characteristics strengths and weaknesses but you also have the ability to make conscious and rational decisions based on new information which means you are almost infinitely malleable and have almost infinite potential your ego however can only characterize you in terms of your limitations so when it presents your characteristics to your consciousness it usually leaves out the infinite potential that you possess because there is no way to know how much potential any particular person has many cultures have identified the essence of a person with their soul a transcendent divine thing that is indestructible connected directly to god and has infinite potential i am not a fan of religion and i hate to inject religious language into my articles but i cannot think of a better concept to characterize the true essence of you than your soul because your soul is separate from and higher than your physical characteristics your belongings your emotions your internal maps and even your thoughts one way to characterize your essence is your ability to make conscious rational decisions but as we will learn your rational thinking ability is often hijacked and tricked by your emotions so even your rational thoughts can be tainted by ego it s not clear what your soul even is but it is something completely separate from anything limited finite or material you don t have to believe in a soul if you don t want but you should extract the important lesson that you should view you as separate from your thoughts emotions and internal maps and that you are infinitely malleable and have infinite potential human beings and other primates evolved to feel shitty when they get rejected from the tribe so when your girlfriend dumps you you feel shitty that shitty feeling can evolve into long term and chronic depression anxiety feelings of inferiority self hatred laziness listlessness paranoia and other self defeating feelings but your girlfriend did not dump you she dumped your outward manifestation your outward appearance your emotions your thoughts your actions etc but because you have an infinite capability to evolve and improve you can change your outward manifestation relatively easy and become a completely different thing than the thing she dumped paradoxically the only thing stopping you from fixing your outward manifestation are those very self defeating feelings that come about as a result of being rejected you should think of your soul as infinitely powerful your outward manifestation is limited you may not be able to ever become feet tall or look like arnold schwarzenegger but you can make major changes to your outward manifestations there are many ways to skin a cat so instead of becoming depressed that you were born a short asian you can use the infinite power of your soul to make yourself powerful in other ways you may say sorry but i m a scientific rationalist and materialist and i don t believe in a soul i think humans are limited and finite if you want to think that way go ahead but you may get end up getting your ass kicked by somebody who does believe in an infinitely powerful soul because that person may end up seeing a path to victory when you see none the reality is that nobody knows exactly what their limitations are and how the world can constrain them so it is better to assume there are no limitations than to assume limitations exist when none actually do your ego is an attempt by your subconscious mind to create a model of your outward manifestation so you can navigate the world but as we will learn in this article this model is often inaccurate in important ways and skews overly negative more importantly there is much our subconscious mind does not know about the world or how the future will unfold so our ego is often overly narrow minded and pessimistic your ego is a useful tool that you can use to accomplish your goals and you should ultimately try to mold your ego as much as possible to tackle the world with hope positivity and optimism but you should be constantly careful to realize that your feelings beliefs and even your thoughts may not be accurate representations of the world the greek philosopher heraclitus famously said that most people live in a fantasy world built by their own mind your goal should be to make your internal map as accurate as possible but one of the hardest things a human can do is to tell the voice in their head that it is wrong to manage your ego you must do the following things keep your soul in charge and use your rational thinking ability to the extent it is working to fix and manage your ego adopt a new set of beliefs about the world that will cause your rational and subconscious minds to work together to build a more positive map of the world constantly test your own boundaries using exposure therapy and prove to your subconscious mind that the threats its perceives are not as bad as it thinks trick your subconscious mind into becoming more positive by showing it positive images engage in activities that flush out your negative emotions like lifting art meditation etc what is your ego your ego is your subconscious internal map of the world and your subconscious internal map of yourself those two maps correspond your subconscious builds your internal map of yourself based on what it thinks the outside world is humans evolved to build these maps to keep us safe from threats and to guide us towards pleasurable things if we see in our internal map a clear path to a pleasurable thing we feel confident and motivated to energetically pursue that thing if we see a path to something we want blocked by threats we become anxious about that path and look for alternative paths our subconscious internal maps seek to guide us towards many things including food shelter warmth sex affection relationships etc but the two most important pleasures for human beings are feeling accepted by the tribe and feeling like you have contributed to the tribe depression is a failure of and anxiety is a failure of to feel like you have contributed to the tribe you pursue some grand purpose with the feeling that you will certainly defeat any challenges on the way to that purpose confidence i call this pleasure journey pleasure and journey pleasure is strongest when you feel you have ventured into the unknown to pursue desirable resources defeated threats and challenges blocking your way to those resources and returned those resources to the tribe to distribute to the members of the community much of our ego is centered around accomplishing or at least feeling like we are accomplishing these two goals acceptance and goal conquering these desires are never satisfied to stay alive we need to stay in good standing in the tribe so we constantly need to feel accepted and like we are contributing to contribute we need to feel like we are making progress towards obtaining some desirable resource and to feel like we are making progress towards a desirable resource our subconscious needs to feel like there is a clear path through our map of the world to get that thing we therefore rely on our maps to feel positive emotions and when our maps are destroyed we are plunged into anxiety and depression human beings evolved to adapt to and accommodate their environment so our ego is an internal character our subconscious mind builds that it thinks will best contend with the world as it perceives it and of course most of our psychological issues are the result of inaccurate internal maps for example people who are overly anxious or timid overestimate the threats in the world and underestimate their own ability to defeat those threats people who arrogant underestimate the challenges of the world and overestimate their own abilities people who are narcissistic are insecure and subconsciously believe that they are constantly on the verge of being rejected by the tribe so they must constantly fight to remain in good standing people who are depressed view themselves as being rejected by the tribe or at the very bottom with no hope or way to rise through the ranks etc to put it another way our ego is the outcome of your assumptions about the world i assume the world is a place where only assholes can succeed therefore my subconscious pushes me to become an asshole i assume that i am at the bottom of the tribal dominance hierarchy and cannot move up therefore my subconscious characterizes me as a sad bitch that needs handouts from people who are higher than me these are strongly anchored by our emotions so our rational mind may even realize that these assumptions and their accompanying emotions are wrong but nevertheless we feel they are true so we internalize them and build our ego around them imagine you are an asian guy and you think or more importantly feel that white women don t like asian guys your subconscious mind may adjust your internal map and ego to reflect this belief you now see yourself as a thing that white women will never like and you adjust your behavior accordingly you may seek to avoid approaching white women to avoid humiliation and rejection you may see white women as somehow superior to you and therefore subconsciously or consciously supplicate to them or debase yourself around them worst of all once you have accepted this barrier in your life your ego will start wondering what other shit you cannot do as you will learn most of the inaccuracies of our map and our concomitant psychological pathologies are the result of an overly negative and fearful view of the world one of the hardest things about becoming psychologically healthy is building an accurate or at least less inaccurate map of the world managing your desire one way your ego can create a counterproductive internal map is by populating your internal map by false pleasures our fundamental motivation comes from our goals conscious or subconscious so if our goals are wrong we can be lead into ruin humans develop counterproductive goals for two reasons we fundamentally misunderstand our desire for acceptance and we are too afraid to pursue our productive goals one of our strongest emotions is our desire for acceptance and that desire becomes the basis for many of our other stupid desires for example people that are obsessed with money status and appearance are actually yearning for acceptance and they subconsciously feel that if they do not have money status and appearance they will be rejected from the tribe it does not help that many people actually will basis their acceptance of you on how much money status and appearance you have as i stated in part of this series insecurity is the feeling that you may be rejected from the tribe and is the primary thing that motivates you to desire things that are not actually necessary for your well being of course there is nothing wrong with having money status or appearance but you should pursue them for rational reasons not to impress some hypothetical tribe that only exists in your head people buy things they can t afford to impress people they don t like because they subconsciously see those people they don t like as being in their tribe people often radically change when they change tribes for example when they graduate high school because the criteria for being cool has now completely changed insecurity also drives drives douchey conformist and submissive behavior because insecure people will do anything they think they need to be accepted they become extremely vulnerable to manipulation political parties corporate marketing cult leaders and psychopathic people all take advantage of people by playing on their insecurities to make matters worse humans evolved to feel like there is only one tribe which means that if an insecure person feels rejection from anybody they feel rejection from the entire tribe this is why people s desires are infinite no matter how much money status or appearance a person has there are always going to be people who have more than them and or will reject them for not having enough which means they will always want more insecure people and narcissists often silo themselves in groups of people they know will accept them so they never need to feel the pain of rejection but you can never completely wall yourself off from people who do not like you the particular pathological things you desire are often influenced by the tribe you are trying to impress for example if you grow up around people obsessed with appearance you will highly value desire and pursue appearance taken to the pathological extreme this desire may cause you to mutilate your face with plastic surgery spend money on clothes you can t afford freak out when you look bad and waste time working on your appearance when there are better things you could be doing this is all a subconscious process you don t consciously think to yourself i overly value appearance because i was raised around people who based their acceptance on appearance instead you just think i like looking good or you may have no conscious thought at all interestingly once you have internalized these desires in your subconscious they will become a part of your internal map once the tribe is gone which means you will still desire these things even if they no longer bring acceptance if somebody sees their value to the tribe as tied up in their attractiveness they may continue to desire being attractive even after they move somewhere everybody is ugly their neural networks still associate attractiveness with acceptance and therefore pleasure even though in their new community attractiveness is no longer required for acceptance women often say i put on makeup and slutty clothes for myself not to impress guys and men think they are lying but women may not necessarily be lying in that case their subconscious mind has associated looking good with acceptance so they feel that rush of pleasure even when there are no actual guys to accept them the first step to removing your pathological desires is understanding that they are usually just distortions of your desire to be accepted if your desire to be accepted has been fulfilled then you can pursue money status and appearance for rational reasons not to impress other people one way to fulfill your desire for acceptance is to find a good group of friends that are solid reliable people that will not condition their acceptance of you and their friendship on stupid criteria or on you supplicating to them but no matter how reliable your friends are they will still occasionally let you down ideally you would find some spiritual way to feel acceptance so that you do not need to rely on earthly sources of acceptance in many religions the idea of god helps people feel accepted which is why religious people are often good at resisting society s pressures psychedelic drugs also induce a deep feeling of acceptance which is why people often associate psychedelics with ego death spiritual experiences and a feeling of release from their regular stupid concerns the neurochemical associated with the feeling of acceptance into the tribe is serotonin and most psychedelic drugs work by flooding the brain with serotonin or serotonin agonists once your brain is flooded with serotonin you feel at one with everything you feel this oneness because you no longer feel like you are on the outside of the tribe and that you need to fight your way to get in you also lose feelings of douchiness anger anxiety and other defense mechanisms against rejection you can also develop pathological desires if your map becomes littered with threats and you feel like there is no clear path to the actual things you should be pursuing your highest pleasure is the feeling of pursuing desirable purposes journey pleasure but you will not feel journey pleasure if you feel like the paths to desirable purposes are blocked problems with ego our internal maps often become inaccurate because they are overly negative fear is our strongest motivator because for our evolutionary ancestors encountering a threat could have meant death or permanent expulsion from the tribe your subconscious mind will happily give up the opportunity to get wins in your life if it means you avoid loss because in the jungle a win was a small amount of food or sex but a loss meant death as you can imagine this type of thinking is no longer relevant for most modern humans because most threats we fear are no longer fatal but nevertheless our emotions are wired to see them as fatal even positive psychological maladies like narcissism and bipolar syndrome are often caused by fear narcissists feel intensely insecure and desperate for acceptance so their mind creates ham handed weak primitive laughable efforts at acceptance like maybe if i brag about how awesome i am people will believe me and accept me into their tribe in other words a narcissist is like a crackhead trying to scheme a way to get a few dollars to get high again impulsivity is also often the result of feeling like you are on the verge of being kicked out of the tribe your subconscious minds wants to consume as much resources as it gets rejected and has no access to resources people with intense anxiety also act impulsively because their subconscious mind sees all their paths to meaningful goals which produce dopamine blocked with threats so they seek dopamine from cheaper easier sources drugs pornography etc as we will learn even people that are overly optimistic often operate from a place of fear their internal maps shows them false easy paths to the things they want but they are too afraid to tear down those maps and replace them with more accurate ones the ego is healthiest when it feels comfortably accepted into the tribe and making progress towards accomplishing meaningful positive goals people who feel comfortably accepted do not feel scarcity and do not act impatiently impulsively or in ways that maximize short term pleasure at the expense of long term gain the ego will not feel healthy however if it feels like you are on the bottom of the dominance hierarchy on the verge of getting kicked out of the tribe or like all your goals are blocked by threats so managing your ego is most often an exercise of eliminating false negativity from your map but it sometimes requires you to add some negativity to your map once you learn of a threat you didn t realize was there but even our failure to accept necessary negative truths about our reality is the result of fear our brain is very reluctant to change a map that it thinks will lead it to a positive outcome because it fears it will never find another map to that positive outcome if you think that you can only be happy by dating katie and then you find out katie cheated on you your subconscious mind may try to ignore the fact that katie is a schisty bitch because it thinks katie is your only chance at happiness and if you leave her you will die alone to summarize your maps could be inaccurate because they are overly positive or overly negative but in both cases the inaccuracy is often because of fear several other things cause our maps to become inaccurate first the world is infinitely complex but our subconscious mind builds our maps based on the thin slice of the world we actually experience which means that if our experiences do not accurately represent the reality of the world then our map will be inaccurate as well for example if you are an asian guy and you have never seen an asian guy actually succeed with a white girl and you have only seen asian guys get rejected by white girls your subconscious mind will build a map where it is impossible for an asian guy to get a white girl why wouldn t it it doesn t know better and logical arguments aren t persuasive to it the fact that your ego builds itself based on its experiences can create a dangerous feedback loop if you are an asian guy who thinks that white women will never like asian guys you may never approach white women but if you never approach white women then you will be less likely to see a white woman like an asian guy which will in turn strengthen your internal map s belief that white women never like asian guys you create your own reality with your actions and if you act based on certain assumptions about reality then the reality you create will reflect those assumptions it is a self fulfilling prophecy our internal maps also become inaccurate because our subconscious mind builds our internal maps using visceral images that provoke emotion rather than cold rational facts imagine our sad asian guy approaches three white women and gets rejected by each one and then his subconscious mind builds a map wherein white girls never like asian guys now imagine you tell our sad asian guy i have lots of rational logical empirical data that shows that white women sometimes like asian guys even if he believes your rational facts his subconscious mind will still think that white women do not like asian men because the subconscious mind was taught that fact by an emotionally significant experience he will still feel anxiety when approaching white women he will still feel like it is an impossible task etc our map building circuits are very old from an evolutionary standpoint much older than our rational brain so rational arguments are not very persuasive to it plenty of people hear the truth but they fail to internalize and accept it because our internal maps are more respondent to emotion and because our subconscious mind is so responsive to emotion our internal maps are often rough drafts and lack nuance a major problem with our internal maps are overly negative is a lack of nuance for example let s say our asian friend approaches a white woman but does so timidly and anxiously and then gets rejected the right lesson our friend needs to learn is women white or not do not respond well to timid and anxious approaches however because our subconscious lizard mind is crude and un nuanced the lesson it might learn is white women do not respond well to approaches for asian men so now his map is much more negative that it needs to be i have coached a lot of guys and usually they do of things right but they have one or two sticking points that keep tripping them up with every woman they approach but their subconscious mind doesn t realize they are doing of things right the subconscious mind just sees a failure rate which makes them feel completely worthless our maps are also often wrong because our subconscious mind does not like to change our maps the world is infinitely complex and our maps are our only source of stability and positive emotion in a sea of chaos so our subconscious mind tries its hardest to keep our maps stable and intact as jordan peterson has famously observed the unknown induces anxiety in humans and any part of the world that our subconscious mind has not created a map for is effectively unknown we rely on our maps for positive emotion because our maps tell us how to get to pleasurable things without our maps we are adrift in a sea of terrifying unknown with no clear path to good things because we are so terrified of the unknown we try to desperately build a map to figure out everything if our map is somehow wrong we need to deconstruct that part of the map and reconstruct it to be correct but the process of deconstruction and reconstruction requires us to go through a period of chaos and anxiety while we are trying to figure out how to correctly reconstruct that map that period of chaos is terrifying so we often prefer to stick with the wrong map than to risk plunging back into chaos i believe that part of our fear may come from the thought that if we deconstruct our maps it will be too difficult for us to put it back together again because of the fear of changing our maps humans often become dependent on overly simplistic religions ideologies political parties beliefs or life plans we sometimes even have a sneaking suspicion that our beliefs may be wrong but we are too afraid to change our maps imagine you are a hardcore christian and most of what you do and believe is based on the bible you are a hard working kind faithful person because of christianity you have avoided drug addiction poverty failed relationships and many other bad decisions because of your christian beliefs now imagine an atheist comes up to and makes some intelligent logical well reasoned points about why christianity is wrong even if the atheist s arguments are persuasive and make sense to you you may still try to ignore them because you are afraid that if you abandon christianity your entire internal map will be gone and you will be plunged back into a chaos were life is meaningless nothing makes sense and you may be tempted by all the bad decisions you previously avoided that may sound silly to you if you are not a christian but it only sounds silly to you because you already have a non christian internal map so you don t realize why a person would need to rely on a christian internal map people are also reluctant to change their maps because they have a deep psychological need to have the most positive map possible our map is our reality so we want to have the best reality possible even if it means ignoring inconvenient facts and living in delusion this causes us to forego taking risks because if we take a risk and fail our reality becomes worse but if we never take the risk we can always comfort ourselves with the idea that we might have succeeded in other words we would rather have uncertainty in our map than a definite negative for example imagine our asian guy who thinks white women do not like asian guys might see a white woman and subconsciously think she might like asian guys but probably not so i will not approach the rational thing to do would be to approach to capitalize on the chance that she likes asian guys but if he thinks that he will probably get rejected he will subconsciously refuse to approach because he would prefer to live in a reality where she might like him rather than one where she definitely does not like him it may sound like i am contradicting myself by saying that our maps are often overly negative and built from fear but also that our mind wants to keep the most positive map possible this contradiction can be resolved as follows our subconscious mind wants to keep the most positive map possible but because it gets an inaccurate view of the world and because it gives too much weight to possibly negative outcomes it almost always creates an overly negative map our subconscious mind is like a crackhead fiending for crack positive emotion but who also thinks that everybody is a cop that is about to arrest him threats the crackhead realizes that some people may not be cops but he keeps his map positive by assuming that everybody is a cop so he doesn t take the risk of getting arrested finally we cannot change our subconscious maps too radically because we rely on our maps for most of what we do our conscious mind cannot make a rational well thought out decision with respect to every single thing we do throughout the day so we need to rely on our subconscious maps to guide us about of what we do is conscious everything else is subconscious or automatic we especially rely on our subconscious maps in social situations most people s social behavior is based on subconscious adjustments to other s reactions because we have such a strong need to be accepted by the tribe if a high status person expresses pleasure at something we did then our subconscious map knows to do that again if the high status person expresses displeasure our subconscious map colors the neural network associated with that action as a threat as you can probably guess you should not completely rely on other people s reactions to guide your behavior in social situations nor should you completely rely on your internal maps because your internal maps may have been built on bad feedback from people who were morons and did not have your best interests at heart at the same time however you cannot just completely dump your internal map and consciously analyze every single thing you do in social situations like some kind of autistic person that would be way too much to remember you would like a soulless robot and you would miss out on the internalized knowledge embedded within your internal map instead you need to fix your ego fixing your ego the first step in fixing your ego is realizing that it is good for you to occasionally dissolve and reconstruct your map even though dissolving your map is painful it is worse to have an inaccurate map while it is inevitable that your map will never be perfect you should want your map to be as good as it can be to feel comfortable dissolving and reconstructing your map you must have faith in your map building abilities as stated before people are afraid to dissolve their map because they think their current map is the best they get and if they lose it they will not be able to replace it with something better you must overcome that fear i think your faith in your map building abilities springs from your beliefs for example i believe that the world is governed by rational laws that can be understood by humans which means that everything about the world is understandable so if ever find yourself adrift in chaos you can eventually rebuild your map by collecting information and putting that information using your own mind i also believe that humans have almost limitless potential to create their own reality so no matter no who you are most of the limitations that you perceive in your map are either constructions of your own mind or can be overcome i also believe that human beings can eventually overcome any limitation so it is better to face our threats and challenges head on rather than running from them once i imagine myself as having an infinitely powerful soul i feel like i can make any change in my exterior world that is necessary i also believe that facing our threats will cause our internal map and therefore our reality to be better in the long run for example let s say our asian friend says i would rather live in a reality where the white woman might like me rather than one where she definitely does not like me the right answer to this guy is not you should approach her anyway because she might like you and if she doesn t like you you just have to deal with it instead the right answer to our asian friend is you should approach her anyway because there is a chance that your reality will improve if you approach her if she likes you great and if she doesn t like you you will learn a lesson that will help you with future approaches no matter what happens however your overall reality after the approach will be better than your reality before the approach this is an extremely important point if you do think have full faith and confidence that you reality will improve if you push your boundaries your subconscious mind will not want to do it we simply do not want to venture into the unknown if it means we might get eaten or may never find our way back to the tribe whenever your rational mind has decided it is safe to push your boundaries and take a new risk you must push that new boundary with the feeling and confidence that you will definitely succeed even if your rational mind understands that you may fail the good news is that once you successfully push your boundaries a few times your subconscious mind starts to realize that the grass is indeed greener on the other side and pushing boundaries is ultimately a beneficial exercise which will cause your subconscious mind to automatically generate positive emotions when venturing into the unknown in the future of course i cannot rationally or scientifically prove any of these beliefs they are more like articles of faith or religion rather than empirically demonstrable facts but humans have discovered since the beginning of time that to succeed sometimes you need irrational unfounded optimism based on unprovable beliefs if you watch interviews with successful people they often reveal that part of the reason for their success was a completely irrational belief that they could succeed an irrational belief that many people do not have if you only base your internal map on your own experiences and what society tells you about reality you may find yourself with an unnecessarily limiting map i am not a fan of religion but i think one advantage of religion is that it gives people hope that the facts as they see them are not all there is and the facts can be broken to create a better reality one of the disadvantages of the scientific materialist worldview is that people feel trapped by the material facts and scientific laws in the world and feel like they cannot overcome their limitations once you ve developed a set of beliefs about the world you can slowly fix your maps with your rational mind and by fix i mostly mean remove unnecessary negativity of course there is some negativity you need for example you should not run into the street thinking that cars cannot hit you i see a lot of guys on the manosphere tell you to kill your ego but i disagree with this approach because they seem to advocate completely dissolving all of your maps and acting like a psychopath this advice is terrible because nobody can actually do this including them removing all of your boundaries will just make you an offensive annoying douchey asshole these guys are creating an army of socially clueless pushy mean dorks that have no sense of social boundaries and will repeatedly fail counterintuitively these guys will become even more depressed and build even more negative maps because their attempts at killing their ego will just produce more failure of course i realize that the manosphere guys give this advice because most of their audience are overly limited and bounded and need to let loose but there must be a happy medium between timid dork and insane psychopath the good news is that your rational mind can identify what threats on your map are real and which are not and it can build a set of nuanced behaviors that will carry you to the things you need while simultaneously avoiding pitfalls for example our asian guy might say that white women do not like when guys approach them and whip out their dick and he would be right that is rationally not the right thing to do and it is fortunate that his subconscious mind has also internalized that fact such that even if you paid him to a group of women with his dick out he still would feel immense anxiety while doing it but if our asian guy says that asian men should never approach white women that statement is just wrong from a rational point of view and his rational mind probably recognizes that it is stupid to generalize all white women as not liking asian men our asian friend may have even seen white women with asian men so how do we use this rational knowledge to actually reprogram our friends mind into approaching asian women as we ve discussed you cannot fix your internal maps with rational arguments so you need to teach your subconscious mind the truth about the world with visceral images that speak to your emotions there are two ways to teach your subconscious mind with real images and with fake images obviously reprogramming your subconscious mind with real images is more effective than reprogramming it with fake images the best way to teach our asian friend s subconscious mind that an asian man can successfully approach a white woman is for him to actually see it happen or better yet for him to actually do it and succeed preferably multiple times if he gets a few successful approaches in his subconscious mind will stop coloring white women as threat and perhaps start to view them as prize and he will feel less anxiety when he sees white women if our asian friend is too crippled with anxiety to approach any white woman we may need to slowly train his subconscious mind using exposure therapy first he makes eye contact with a few white women nothing bad will happen probably so his subconscious mind will realize that making eye contact with white women will not lead to anything harmful next he practices saying hi to white women just hi nothing else after his subconscious mind learns that nothing bad happens after saying hi and in fact good things often happen he can move onto approaching starting a conversation etc i ran out of room on reddit please see the rest of my article at my website
16397,i don t give a fuck has become the mantra for our modern age from drunk frat boys to angsty teenagers to people arguing in facebook comments it has become important for people to let other people know that they do not care what they think this is ironic because if somebody feels the need to tell you they don t give a fuck they probably give a fuck in reality i don t give a fuck usually means i care deeply but i don t want to admit it why is giving a fuck so bad and why has our culture become so obsessed with not giving a fuck from dating to pop culture to news to business deals it always seems like the loser in every transaction is the party that cares most people in our modern culture have become obsessed with not giving a fuck because human beings evolved to deeply care what others think of them humans evolved to live in tribes and evolution keeps the tribe together and people acting correctly by wiring them to care deeply about what the tribe thinks of them and by the tribe i mean the alpha male emotionally speaking not giving a fuck is very difficult because what the alpha male thinks of us determines whether we are accepted into the tribe or not and whether we are accepted into the tribe or not determines whether he live or die in the jungle and whether we have access to the resources we want and need to survive the subconscious desire to conform to the whims of the tribe is so strong primal and deeply ingrained that we often do not realize that we are giving a fuck or that we are altering our behavior to make other people happy most people want to think to themselves at least consciously that they are independent free thinkers that form beliefs and make decisions based on rational reasons and not emotion or peer pressure but science and plain old observation clearly show that humans frequently irrationally change their behavior due to pressure from whoever seems to have power and authority at the same time sometimes you should give a fuck what other people think the world is too complicated to figure out everything on our own so we largely rely on others to tell us what to believe and how to act without feedback from our community we would become weird antisocial psychopaths living in the woods like the unabomber we also need to be able to work together understand the emotions of others and take into account their feelings and finally nobody is perfect and we all need help and guidance from others to improve ourselves because we need to enmesh ourselves in a series of relationships to fulfill our emotional needs and to help us reach our highest potential we sometimes need to give a fuck so when should you give a fuck and when should you not give a fuck and most importantly how do you not give a fuck the challenge is to determine which of the feedback we are receiving from others has merit and which of it does not have merit much of the feedback we get from others is wrong which occurs for many reasons including the person giving the feedback is stupid the feedback is technically correct but is incomplete so it is unhelpful to us the feedback is not applicable to us or the person giving the feedback is consciously or subconsciously trying to manipulate us into doing something that is not good for us sometimes the feedback is wrong for more than one of these reasons at the same time to be able to discriminate between meritorious and non meritorious feedback you must do three things fulfill your emotional requirements so you feel confident and certain about what you are doing so you can no longer be emotionally manipulated by others create for yourself a set of rational rules and boundaries for how to interact with other people and what you do for them and develop emotional intelligence to determine what other people want from you and when if you should give it to them in this article i hope to give a brief sketch of how to do these three things and then later expand this article into a full fledged book fulfilling your emotional requirements when your emotional requirements are not met you are more likely to accept bad feedback and let others manipulate you because you rely on others to fulfill your emotional requirements for example your girlfriend may withhold sex or attention from you unless you do something she wants you to do or your boss may threaten to fire you depriving you of your financial means of support unless you do what he says any emotional need you have love affection money status becomes a lever that others can use against you the two highest and strongest pleasures for any human beings are the feeling of pursuing desirable purposes and the feeling of being accepted into the tribe anxiety is a failure of depression is a failure of if these emotional needs are filled it will be much harder to manipulate you into doing things that are wrong for you you will be more calm confident certain of your purposes happy and emotionally stimulated of course you are always vulnerable to manipulation because even if your emotional needs are satisfied no person is completely self sufficient from a material standpoint everybody needs food money shelter and acceptance and to some degree we are always dependent on others for these things but if your emotional requirements are met you will be much more able to go get these things by yourself without needing to rely on any particular person many emotionally weak people become dependent on others because they are afraid that they cannot get money sex or emotional fulfillment elsewhere in turn the master in these unhealthy relationships reinforces the slave s belief that they are incapable of being emotionally fulfilled without the master pursuing desirable purposes to pursue desirable purposes you must conceptualize your desires purposes and emotions as a pyramid with lower purposes supporting higher ones at the bottom of the pyramid are your lowest purposes eating shitting having sex staying warm etc those purposes must be satiated so you can pursue your higher purposes lifting having a successful career maintaining good relationships etc at the top of the pyramid your highest purpose the purpose which all lower purposes support is your desire to venture into the unknown defeat the threats that lay therein and create a transcendent future reality that is infinitely better than your current reality the highest pleasure a person can feel in life is life is what i call journey pleasure the feeling of making progress towards an appealing goal when you see or conceptualize a pleasurable goal and take steps to achieve that pleasurable goal and you do not feel like the path to the goal is blocked you feel pleasure as artie lange said the best part of doing cocaine is going to your dealer to get it the excitement and enthusiasm you feel on the way to something your subconscious thinks will be pleasurable is much stronger and longer lasting than the destination pleasure you feel when you actually consume that thing by ordering your purposes correctly you can maximize your journey pleasure a person who feels journey pleasure will find it easier to control their emotions and think rationally because they will have less anxiety and because they will not be tempted by destination pleasure as much journey pleasure is stronger than destination pleasure lasts over a longer period of time and does not require external things so feeling journey pleasure will free you from the tyranny of destination pleasure destination pleasure only lasts for the brief moment while you consume the pleasurable thing and then disappears when the pleasurable thing disappears you feel destination pleasure while you eat the cake have sex or hug you friend but that pleasure is temporary and requires the pleasurable object journey pleasure on the other hand is primarily mental lasts for as long as you are working towards your goal so you can feel it anytime and anywhere if you are building your business you can feel journey pleasure as you work as you eat lunch and even as you have a few beers with your friends to wind down because all of those activities are taking you towards your goal journey pleasure is required for emotional stability and rationality humans are pleasure seeking creatures and we cannot think rationality if we are chasing one brief pleasure after another but feeling journey pleasure satiates our desire for pleasure and once we have a consistent source of journey pleasure we can make rational long term plans even people that enjoy journey pleasure need to feed their lower desires occasionally but because their higher pleasures are satiated all of their thoughts and emotions are not directed towards satisfying their lower pleasure feeling accepted to feel accepted into the tribe you must find a good group of friends that will love you relatively unconditionally i say relatively unconditionally because all love is conditional you would probably dump one of your friends if they were a serial killer or a child molester but a good friend will be there for your reasonable ups and downs and not condition their friendship on how much money or status you have or whether you let them manipulate you into doing things that are not in your best interest you need a solid tribe that has accepted you so that when others reject you or try to manipulate you you can run back to the warmth of your own tribe and not feel completely cast adriff in the wilderness you also need a good group of friends to call you out on your bullshit give you rational advice when your emotions are acting up and notice things about yourself that you may not notice humans need to feel acceptance and if we do not have a solid group of people to accept us we end up being vulnerable to being manipulated by those who do not have our best interests in mind think of acceptance like food if you are starving you will do anything for food including sucking dick in an alley if however you are satiated with respect to food shitty people will not be able to manipulative you for food either way however you still need food the question is just where you get it from if you fail to cultivate decent relationships with a solid core of people you will always have a hole finally most of our bullshit desires are the result of not feeling accepted humans have natural desires eating sleeping having sex but we also develop a set of artificial desires that are often warped and distorted versions of our natural desires artificial desires including wanting to drive a lamborghini wanting to a fuck certain girl as opposed to other girls wanting to be famous etc artificial desires are often the results of several of our natural desires combining oftentimes our desire for sex our desire for novelty and our desire for acceptance and status the desire for acceptance and status usually plays the strongest part and people don t even realize this they don t realize that their desire to drive a lamborghini or fuck the hottest girl in the club is a result of their insecurity they feel like they are on the fringes of the tribe and the only way they can be accepted and feel high status is by doing something that is actually unhealthy and unnecessary but if you are accepted by a good group of people your artificial desires will be more manageable creating a set of rational rules and boundaries because most people are emotionally dependent on others for acceptance they rely on others to define for them what is right and wrong the human need for acceptance is so strong that we often subjugate all of our other thoughts beliefs and other emotions in favor of our need for acceptance we often even let the tribe dictate our moral and religious beliefs think about it most people who are born and raised in christian countries become christian whereas most people born and raised in muslim countries become muslim now do you really think that all of those christians rationally analyzed christianity and rationally determined that it is superior to islam and all those muslims rationally analyzed islam and determined that it is superior to christianity of course not people in christian countries are christian because their society pressured them into being christian and people in muslim countries are muslim because their society pressured them into being muslim of course it is possible that one of islam or christianity is a rationally defensible religion to follow but even if it was that s not why people follow it they follow it because of the pressure of the tribe to become an independent self actualized person however you must create a set of rational rules and boundaries that will guide your behavior in interpersonal relationships so you no longer rely on other people to tell you how to act this will take a lot of work the world is a complex place and you will run into a lot of morally difficult situations where you will be pressured to act in the wrong way building a set of rational rules will take a lot of time reading thinking and experimentation but it is the only way to act independently in addition you must constantly re analyze and re assess your rules in case you adopted a bad rule or boundary i am not going to tell you all the rules and boundaries you must adopt your rules and boundaries will be influenced by your religion your moral beliefs your society your temperament and other factors that are unique to you all i can give you is a few principles that i think should guide your formulation of your rules first you should never do anything for anybody that they would not do for you to be even more strict you can expand this rule to say that you will not do anything for anybody that they have not already done for you a logical corollary to this rule is that you will not do not anything for anybody that does not have your best interests at heart if somebody is taking from you without giving anything in return they probably do not have your best interests at heart if somebody conditions their relationship with you on you giving them money or other favors that they are not giving you back then you are not in a relationship you are paying for a prostitute this sounds obvious and a rule of basic fairness but articulating this rule to yourself will help you stick to it when you are actually in a situation where somebody is manipulating you second your rules must be structured in such a way that you do not let anybody interfere with your pursuit of your highest purposes your highest pleasure and the most important thing in your life is your purpose so if you let others interfere with it they do not have your best interests at heart the only possible exception to this rule is a sick family member that is helpless on their own through no fault of their own but even in the latter case you condition your help to them in the way that interferes with your purposes in the smallest possible way third your rules should lead to an outcome that is good for the person asking for your help if somebody wants you to do something that is self destructive for them for example buying cocaine you should not help them i say this not only because is it morally wrong to do thing for others that hurts them but also because if you feed somebody s counterproductive addictions you just strengthen that addiction that make them more likely to seek that thing from you again once you learn how to set boundaries you will come to respect other people s boundaries as well people that are easily manipulated often expect too much from other people as well so they often feel disappointed and rejected for example a lot of guys who let women walk all over them also get very angry at women who do not reciprocate their advances these guys fail to realize that just as a woman is not entitled to get x y and z thing from him just because she flirted with him a little the man is not entitled to get x y and z thing from just because he bought her a drink relationships should be based on a mutual assent where each side agrees to bring the other party in if she didn t agree to do something you should not expect it from her and if you did not agree to something she should not expect it from you developing emotional intelligence to analyze whether feedback has merit you need to be able to read the intentions of the person giving the feedback and to be able to read peoples intentions you need emotional intelligence and situational awareness you are constantly receiving feedback from all kinds of people some of that feedback you need to immediately ignore some of it you need to immediately act on and for some of it you need to do additional research because you do not have the time to do additional research on every single piece of feedback you get you need shortcuts to determine what feedback has merit and what does not one shortcut to gauge how much you should trust somebody giving feedback is to analyze their motivations why are they giving you this feedback how would they benefit for example if your best friend told you hey dude your car really sucks it is probably going to break down and you will never get any girls driving a car like that you may decide to do some research into buying a new car because you assume your best friend is looking out for your best interests but if a used car dealer told you the same thing you are more likely to write off his opinion because you assume he is only saying that because he wants to sell you a car similarly if your mother asked you for money you may decide to give it to her if she needed it for surgery but not if she was going to use it on gambling those are two extreme obvious examples but you make these types of calculations all the time often without thinking when receiving feedback from people to understand peoples motivations you must look at a wide variety of factors how do they benefit from you accepting this feedback is there something about their background that makes them likely to give this feedback your relationship to them their history what you know about people like this etc if somebody made a bunch of money in real estate they are likely to tell you to invest in real estate because that is all they know not because it is necessarily a good investment if somebody got burned in a real estate deal they may irrationally tell you to avoid real estate not because real estate is bad but because they were stupid and got burned ultimately you also need to build a knowledge base about how the world works once you meet and understand a variety of manipulative people you will understand how they operate and will be able to resist their charms you will also learn when people are serious with their demands and when they are bluffing you will learn when people have vital information that could help and when they are making shit up there is no substitute for this experience you just have to learn it in the real world to develop the emotional intelligence to evaluate people s intentions you need to be emotionally fulfilled if you are not emotionally fulfilled you will be needy which will cause you to fail to think rationally for example a lot of men and women become lonely and desperate for a relationship so if somebody shows them any attention or interest they automatically assume that the person actually likes them they become blind to reality because they are so desperate for love but if they were emotionally fulfilled they could look at the person s intentions objectively conclusion finally the last skill you need to learn to stop giving a fuck what people think is the ability to have faith and leap into the unknown you never know what will happen when you hold your boundaries until you try it after you successfully hold your boundaries a few times you will learn that not only are you strong enough to hold your boundaries but often times the people trying to give you bad feedback back down and respect you more shitty people live in the same world as everybody else they generally know what is right and wrong they know what is and is not acceptable and they are constantly stopped in their efforts at manipulation by other people who do hold their boundaries shitty people oftentimes try to act like they live in a different reality and that if you do not accept their bizarre rules of how humans interact you will be unable to have a relationship with them oftentimes they present this front so convincingly that people think they have no choice but to cave but the reality is that shitty people know they are being shitty and instead of living by a different set of rules in general they are just making a different set of rules for you once you stand up to them and teach them there will be no different set of rules for you they usually respect you more and if they don t they should not have been in your life in the first place my website
16812,of all the red pills you ve ever read these should be the ones to help you understand yourself the most welcome to my new series magnificent masculinity where we will explore and celebrate what makes men tick today s topic is one that i suspect many men on this forum have an aversion to investigate boyhood the foundational aspects needed for young boys to mature into strong willed healthy bodied socially successful and dominate men before we dive in i d like to share my experience you can skip this part if you just want to get to the meat of the meal i ve spent the last years speaking with men of all ages creeds and belief structures my travels have taken me from the beaches of brazil the night life of paraguay the jungles of peru the rivers of italy the cold streets of chicago the loud centers of new york to the hostile jail of my hometown the quiet suburbs of virginia and the country roads of alabama i unironically wanted to find myself like many young women who embark on international spiritual and end up banging foreign chad s minus the sex i enjoyed what these young women did talk i ve spoken to successful dads to deadbeats law school graduates to meth addicts law abiding men to cold criminals psychologists and freemasons atheists and spiritualists and many more shades of men all just trying to figure out what made me what i am a man in this series i ll be combining my knowledge and experience of masculinity from different cultures environments and social situations into easily digestible information for you to enhance your understanding of your own masculinity this isnt your daddies hold frame guide but even with all my curiosity and investigation i still don t have all the answers the answers i do have may be dead wrong i hope you write out your disagreements and when you think of your sons or your own adolescence you will have information to consult without further ado what boys need throughout my travels i often repeated this same question to the men i interacted with what top things do you believe a young boy needs to succeed in life i was gifted with a variety of answers and i ve narrowed them down to essentials that a boy cannot overcome adversity without a pair of nurturing amp inspirational heterosexual parents caregivers in today s age women see their sons growing and in need of masculinity this is doubly true for single mothers who can t seem to speak to the masculine essence of the boy it is a proven fact that women cant raise boys to be men i saw this first hand in high school where a teen was being raised by fat lesbians needless to say he was a social outcast with no social expertise he was later expelled for bringing a gun to school boys need men to guide them through the path of life instead of respecting and cultivating masculinity in the west cultural leaders spent decades demeaning masculinity and elevating femininity to morph men into androgynous sissy boys an unfortunate reality of our society is that men are taking a grave risk by starting a family inviting the government to intrude on what should be a private affair the average mother pushes their sons to not behave like how men do this resulted in a rise in dangerous violent and antisocial men lash out with their repressed masculinity or a fetishization of masculinity where boys dress up as girls and tie ribbons around their cock and share nude photographs of themselves with perverts it is vital for parents especially those with both sons and daughters to reverse the cultural teachings that woman are victims and men are abusers this kind of non sense only encourages promiscuity in girls and shame in boys if a boy is taught by his parents that he must protect the weak females from himself he will grow up believing he is defective another destructive force society has been promoting is divorce years ago it was argued that divorce is good for the child but that has of course been debunked it is in fact revealed that without a strong father in the picture boys will more often than not grow up into a world of criminality i spoke with a correctional officer who told me that out of all his cases percent of the male offenders grew up in a single mother household it is important to not give your child everything they demand for a demand is meant to test the limits of their caregivers resources once demands aren t being met a boy will begin to seek what he can achieve rather than seeking what caregivers can provide to become a man a boy must learn to rely on themselves and encouraging them to grow into independent young men reinforces this development in boys mothers don t feel bad when your boy pulls away for if he never separates from you he will never set his own boundaries or ever achieve true independence with a mate it falls on the man men in the boys life to help the mother distance herself from her children in healthy relationships a boys first alliance is with his father they work together and grow together when a mother divorces a father the boy will feel anger and betrayal at his mother for pushing the father away do not have children with a woman who is bent on prostituting herself at the expense of your boys the relationship a boy has with his mother is easily the most complex relationship one will have in today s age where most fathers are weak willed it is the mother who tends to be the primary influence on the children coincidentally babies are more likely to form a stronger bond with the mother rather than the father in all primate species the offspring must bond with the caregiver to survive in human s however babies seek to please the motherer or who ever is providing the most care to the child in the first few months of life to little holding feeding cooing and such from the motherer will leave a baby feeling unloved and unsafe the baby will spend a great deal of their emotional energy dealing with these negative emotions rather than growing up healthy another factor to consider is that children will feel resentment towards the symbolic father or the entity that takes the motherer away from them boys in particular will feel a sexual and emotional rivalry to the symbolic father the man thing who loves takes away his motherer for fathers the toughest yet most rewarding part of their relationship with their son is going from daddy to dad boys ask hundreds of questions to their father as they grow older the caliber and frequency of these questions change however they will always seek that masculine wisdom from dad a boy is in essence a father s mini me he lives in the shadow of his father and learns lessons on what kind of man to become every boy wants from their father a sense of mission and purpose and permission to pursue that mission it is up to fathers to provide a masculine foundation for their boys lest he grow up and turn to his wife to strangers or to subreddits and say i don t know what it means to be a man please teach me sounds familiar being an inspirational father starts with the conscious decision to be a father i ve found that men who were coaxed or tricked by women into having children always fell short in comparison to fathers who chose to raise kids a father must be self aware how can he guide a child to become the best possible version of himself when he himself is stagnant and close minded unable to change and grow a father must be comfortable with himself in the sense that he understands himself and his limitations what he cannot teach to his son he will still assist by guiding him towards the correct mentors finally a father must be able to let go of his son to live out his own vision and inspire his son to do the same a boy needs a father who feels he belongs in the society around him and one who can bring him positive growth inducing influences children simply need the guidance of both a mother and a father and those lacking in either department will be desperate to prove they are adequate girls becoming sluts and boys turning to crime they need a mother to say your weakness and vulnerabilities are a worthy foundation for your strength and they need a father to say your dreams and visions are all achievable a mother to say it is okay to feel love and a father to say i will teach you how to respect yourself and not be taken advantage of a clan clique gang or tribe the tightest bond a male can develop is one born from common struggle shared goals or a successful initiation since the beginning of humanity humans were tribal creatures and boys in particular evolved to be hunters and work in tight knit groups our male brains are encoded with this group functionality it is embedded in our dna to thrive in the tribal experience even after the industrial revolution where individual successes became the primary motivator it was still groups of men who built the foundations and mechanisms of society as we progress past the age of corona we will see our male brains have not changed much boys and men still seek tribes to grow in and contribute to and men still work together in collectives boys with tribes are gifted with a large circle of energy and influence allowing the boy to expand through physical activity and develop as a young man clans also provide an environment of competition and acceptance the more members of his clan that take note of him the more confident the boy feels this is especially true when the boy is rewarded with accolades or certain statuses in his clique if after spending a significant amount of time within a tribe a sport team for example and they haven t been recognized by his peers he will find another clique to join saying fuck this i m out of here one of these things is not like the others however boys without a peer group are lost and troubled often leading to them joining a gang in the gang the boy finds a place where he can complete tasks and feel part of a powerful collective i had the pleasure of attending a party in virginia hosted by some local crips one of the bigger east coast gangs finito the one who hosted the party sipped lean as he recounted him being jumped into his set yeah it was on and i knocked down one of them but couldn t take em all they just kept beating my ass for a brick long time but i knew they went through the same shit that s proof they toes down neighborhood crips son rolling i asked him why join the crips and not another gang cus it was the crips was showin me and mine love you understand me they was givin me nd my cousins food helpin my mom pay rent they was like my family when a boy hears the phrase come join our team you re one of us their confidence soars and they feel right at home boys who cannot find success and status through conventional means will seek such achievements through anti social means but either way they will always seek to do these works in a group tribe an anthropologist named victor turner took the scholarly approach as he studied an african tribe in zambia he took note that boys were initiated through rites of passage in large groups rather than individually like how girls do turner went on to state that through my studies of various tribes i can confirm that boys do not have an individualistic nature on the contrary they are wired with collectivist nature in their hearts although in recent times we ve seen an erosion of group dynamics while in the past group leaders were group and service oriented where as now they are more ego oriented likewise followers have become less collaborative and more individualistic in recent times people are being brought up to be egoic leaders as seen from those in the managerial caste of the workplace and of course people boys are being taught to follow the egoistic type of leader and not to commit to any particular group boys are encouraged to shop around for a leader that justifies their beliefs if they don t like a leader they find a new one they weave in and out of groups without becoming attached to any spiritually awesome leader or faction and this ends up leaving boys tribeless the topics of good leadership and effective following will be expanded upon as later subjects we ve seen that boys are wired to work in groups but because of modern perversions we can see that when boys find a group they wish to participate in they have trouble figuring out what to do there what their role is how to lead when to follow who to follow etc it used to be that the greater collective formed a boy s character while that boys unique posse tested and befriended that character a boy s and a man s posse also gives him the opportunity to express himself without restraint many boys and men get together to work play watch tv do sports fish hunt or any other activity but they find themselves in fear of appearing weak for discussing serious matters such as a family problem growing old or intimate relations with the fairer sex if you cannot discuss your problems with your comrades you have no comrades because of this fear for male connection boys will vomit their emotional lives to the women in their lives but they simply cannot handle the responsibility there are things you just cant say to women woodrow wilson wrote that a boy is the role he plays among his fellows men are in love with power yet if they only use that power for selfish gains there will be no enlargement of their soul they enter the world disgruntled and beggared wilson s words can be translated to an understanding of a man s individualistic search for power that search must be united with the sense that a boy s tribe a boys collective needs that individual power in order to flourish which in turn creates a better world for the individual a spiritual life or a connection to the divine the link a man has to spirituality is essential for maturity that link is missing for the majority of american families educational foundations and culture in general in our ancestral past sacred texts detailed the roles of both men and women for boys it was almost expected that they would become a soldier and perhaps sacrifice his life for a greater cause to seek glory on the battlefields in the eyes of the gods whether or not we realize it it is ingrained in men for them to be willing to sacrifice themselves for a cause they believe in while on an ayahuasca retreat in peru the head shaman and i spoke exchanged thoughts on divinity and the role it plays on masculinity he told me men are blessed with creative energy as our natural state and he lamented that american boys forsake spiritual growth in favor of material pleasures he continued of course this is because americans have turned away from the natural order of biology you pretend that socialization is the primary influence rather than biological determinance as if cultural norms makes boys and girls what they are instead of what nature designed them to be in south america they don t have this problem the common people understand boys and girls are drastically different they honor both the masculine and feminine poles of divine energy love itself is a spiritual discipline meant to be mastered to learn how to love another a person must be initiated into loving themselves first while in the jail of my hometown a man was studying nietzsche when i told him i enjoyed reading about diogenes and socrates he told me that was fantastic that i had the potential for brilliance he was then disappointed when i joined some others for bible study later on he pulled me aside and commented christianity is for the weak it is the religion of women and slaves when the jews wrote the torah and the old testament they understood what it meant to be strong the new testament is filled with weakness christianity is a perversion of the original jewish teachings i asked him what he believed in and he told me he was a follower of the norse gods it was then i learned the difference between spiritual practices that honor masculinity and those that attempt to distort it into a perverted femininity texts that honor masculine nature give boys guidance through story telling effectively creating guidelines for boys to live their lives as men they also provide a culture of tradition sacred rituals and tasks rules objectives and spiritual certainty in turkey boys are guided by the koran into adulthood fathers and uncles guide their young boys by celebrating their new found adult freedoms but combine them with the acknowledgement of adult responsibilities america has abandoned tradition whereas in the past fathers would say to their sons you are a rockefeller you will go into business like me but now they say find yourself find your own way this is because of individuality being promoted in america and although i personally advocate for sons to find their own purpose in life this individualistic nature in america has become abused the modern sense of egalitarianism and utilitarianism promised a rise of individual freedoms but it leaves its proponents starved of values and development by not having a hand in their sons destiny fathers have neglected their development few boys of the modern age go through the spiritual journey of exploring and improving their own masculinity few entertain the idea of creating a moral system for themselves rather than cookie cutter morality society forces on them here are some questions to ask yourself what are your responsibilities as a human being what do you define integrity as what constitutes courage in your eyes to whom do you owe compassion to how do you show compassion can you be compassionate toward yourself what principles do you live by what is sacred what is worth living for what is worth dying for i believe that teaching boys that the world is a creation rather than an accident they develop a natural respect for their life and grow in curiosity of the mystic if we teach boys about a creator or the intelligently designed universe they develop faith a faith in themselves where they understand the continuity the universality and the security of all existence and that he is a part of it healthy competition boys need to perform well and be victorious in competition to feel worthy this love of competition extends even to friendly verbal banter where friends curse and attempt to verbally one up each other xbox live match making lobbies or highschool sports arenas are great places to experience adolescent masculinity in action shit talking that only ends when a victor is declared in chicago i learned the power of playful competiton verbal sparring can be damaging if done by an adult to garner power over a boy or if the boy cant diss back for fear of violence or something else but playful jousts the kind i saw between black fathers and sons you goin out lookin like that only strengthen and sturdy up a boy reinforcing his frame humans experience life through perceived hierarchical systems that vary based on the circumstances men and boys within these systems compete for positons in the power structure competiton can become toxic leading to men who are only able to interact through competiton this leads to unhealthy relationship dynamics where the man is always trying to out perform their partner the result of such a relationship being a surplus of negative emotions and resentment ironically anger and aggression are not negative emotions in regards to masculine competition while visiting my family an italy i spoke with a scholar who specialized in the ancient roman republic amp empire he told me that to the legionaries anger was a sacred energy to be channeled in battle this cultivation of anger began in a legionaries childhood where his father and mentors guided the boys aggression almost a kind of ancient anger management class through a balance of competition and play most boys can avoid developing this unhealthy tendency instead the problem majority of boys will face is finding an environment to excel in a top priority for men in mentorship roles is to explore avenues of competition excelling in physical sport defeating others in combat being the smartest in the class to be a master class chess champion or to play an instrument better than others or to paint or write better than others the mentor and boy must work together to find an arena to both compete in and perform well in the ideal competitive environment is one where the boy has a chance at winning if he is beaten severely he will be discouraged from competing further their self esteem will drop below what is was before they ever started the sport they will turn away and sometimes become hostile this is why a white belt should not fight a black belt in a tournament boys must find ways to compete and see themselves as performing well if society does not provide or discourages these outlets then boys will compete against society itself without giving structure for boys to compete in and take note of roman anger management we get uncontrollably aggressive men who abuse competition one form of abuse is vicarious competition the world has used sports as a defining factor in modern entertainment and it has led to many males spending a dangerous amount of time watching inflated rubber dance across a field believing themselves to be part of the team they observe and even experiencing extreme emotions from watching the teams victory or defeat despite the negative possibilities associated with competition it is nevertheless one of the most powerful tools for socialization we have at our disposal when society takes part in guiding healthy competition we give structure to the competitive experiences our boys partake in in paraguay i spoke with my cousin an amateur mma cage fighter who told me of his love for competition i find my love in the toughness and harshness of discipline and contests for me it s about the risk of getting knocked down having the will to get back up again it s the physical and mental wounds that develop me i grow because i compete i grow thanks to the guys who care enough to be my rivals competition is a holistic experience for men where they enrich their mentality physicality and even spirituality competition gives boys praise when they succeed and critique if they fail if there is a coach boys have the opportunity to form a bond with a mentor role model competitive teams also provide boys with a surrogate family my cousin continued saying my training partners are like my brothers i love them one minute then hate them another time mentors or role models being a boys or even a mans role model is the ultimate compliment they want to be more like you without strong male mentors and role models people feel lost alla mentor her from twitter they didn t care they had plenty of female role models to choose from they wanted men to be the teachers without fathers and role models we lose a large portion of our humanity fathers and male mentors who can adjust to a culture where masculinity is feared and demonized are needed in america now more than ever these fearless heroes do the vital work of educating guiding providing opportunities to grow in power give presence goals and acceptance without mentors and role models boys will become emotionally isolated and lonely they will drift aimlessly through life without an objective to accomplish elder male mentors provide boys with direction discipline and inter generational magic we see examples of elder mentorship here on our very own theredpill subreddit where the average ec age is s mentors teach boys how to develop healthy boundaries with women how to appreciate them for what they are rather than hating them for what they aren t and to not become the kind of man who agrees with everything a woman says only to have her resent him for it and leave him a healthy man can stand up for himself without putting the other person down male mentors help young men navigate the changes in their minds and souls they assist boys in developing the skills to succeed in their mission or adventure and most importantly they help a boy understand the difference between contributing through sacrifice rather than self destruction i noticed in paraguay where the villages are tight knit it s much easier for boys to find role models here in america you not not ever know because boys are more isolated and turn to the internet for mentorship because of the inorganic nature of role models today it is up to the elder men to facilitate the real world role models bsutansalt has attempted this with his fraternity tribe a great way to connect with young men is to extend a hand to him through a project he enjoys rather than talking to him directly in regards to competition mentors must take note on whether their scribe is growing if the boy is growing in confidence he s doing it right if not the mentor must take action to find a better arena for their charge to perform in another facet for mentors is being there to watch the boy succeed boys want to make somebody proud if a mentor sets up a boy in a competition and then doesn t show up to watch it will damage the boys confidence severely to learn how to lead as a child i was the leader of the neighborhood kids even the teens wanted to follow me and it was because i had the cool adventurous ideas i was always fascinated with war all of my toys were toy guns or toy soldiers and we played war every day besides war we played sports and explored the woods near our apartments the property manager called me the ring leader when she was explaining to my parents how i rallied up the local kids to do dumb shit looking back they didn t just follow me because i had cool and fun ideas they followed me because i genuinely enjoyed my time and loved it when others enjoyed themselves with me i invited every kid to come play with us the more the merrier i saw myself as the servant of my friend group i assisted in everyone s enjoyment and development of themselves i took the respect they gave me and returned it in kind leaders serve as a kind of spiritual mirror especially in medieval times kings and queens were believed to have been god sent and when people were mirrored by their leader they literally felt blessed boys were raised to try and attain this leadership quality and if they couldn t they followed those who could with passion a bad leader on the other hand manipulates his followers to gain something for himself or his small faction fear and dishonesty are his primary tools of enforcing his rule to learn how to follow rarely will you be a leader in every domain even alexander the great was a student of a greater man aristotle you must learn how to follow and who to follow to grow from a boy to a man an adventure or mission to embark on masculine energy is drawn to explore conquer and it accomplishes this through seeking adventure a boy s life must be an adventure for them to unravel to discover who they are and become connected to their own masculine identity and power at the same time this adventure will give boys a mission or missions for them to embark on resulting in bonding with their fellow men discover in full who there are and what they can achieve what they like and dislike to fully understand the big other of their environment and embrace it along with being embraced by their own tribe and to realize they are spiritual beings at one with everything the dynamics of a boys life are changed for the better when their mission s are intertwined with the adventure they have being a soldier in war is a drastic example of missions being tied to the general adventure although there is no great war besides the cultural war to be fought at the moment we can still see the inspiration of it within the warlike examples of video games and sports although these are mere simulations of true adventure and missions a companion to share that adventure with a man is the sum of his people when i visited new york i was on a mission to have a blast with an old lover of mine and i brought my best friend along for the ride together we left our quiet home town and traveled via bus to a foreign land we found drugs sex and adventure together and i can honestly say my experience wouldn t have been as grand without him we need fellows to share our successes with an important role in life in my time in brazil i was among the shavante a people whose lives are guided by the lands and tradition both men and women have a clear sense of why they are alive and what the world needs them for and what their role is for millions of years the boys of our race knew and understood their role in life the provider the protector and the conqueror they were rewarded for these behaviors but now in the post modern age the new roles that are rewarded are for example the fun lover or the star or the pill popper being a provider and protector is no longer worthy in a woman s eyes although among men these traits are still virtuous as you can see the male role has shifted boys young men and even mature men are calling for a revision on what a male s role in life should be without a sacred role to play a man will grow hypermaterialistic lonely unhappy and unfulfilled a boy needs structure and discipline in which to learn who he is he needs to be part of a journey with clear goals and responsibilities he needs a role in life i hope this information is of use to you perhaps i will expand upon these ideas in edits if you like this post and would like to see more please tell me as much as i write for myself i am encouraged by knowing i am helping other men through their journey in life
16814,in this article i describe a plan to increase confidence my plan consists of three techniques which you do in decreasing order of preference train your subconscious mind to see opportunity and success where it previously saw threat so you don t feel anxiety learn to articulate and face your anxiety and learn to ignore your anxiety technique is best if technique doesn t work move to technique if technique doesn t work move to technique i think these techniques need to be done in order if you try to ignore your anxiety before you articulate and face it you will miss out on valuable information the most important thing you need to know about confidence is that it is mostly fake and by fake i mean based on no rational reason confident people do not think they will succeed because they have any rational reason to think they will succeed but because they have faith obviously it helps if your faith is backed up by rational reasons but sometimes you don t have any rational reasons so you need faith confidence anxiety and your subconscious mind confidence has an intellectual element and an emotional element in other words confidence is the feeling and belief that you will succeed at whatever purpose you are pursuing whether it be brushing your teeth building a business pursuing a woman or anything else the opposite of confidence is anxiety which is the feeling that you will fail at pursuing your purpose because a threat or obstacle blocks the path generating the intellectual aspect of confidence is much easier than generating the emotion to generate intellectual confidence all you need to do is analyze the facts in your possession and formulate a plan if the facts clearly indicate you will succeed you can confidently soldier ahead if the facts clearly indicate you will fail you can decide to go do something else certain that you did the right thing if the facts are uncertain like in most situations you can confidently soldier ahead until you collect additional facts which will tell you whether to keep going or do something else you may also decide to confidently risk failure if the facts are uncertain if you think that failure will not be so bad the difficulty of generating confidence however is getting your subconscious mind to generate the feeling of confidence your subconscious mind generates emotions based on a complex analysis of the data available to it and your intellectual analysis is often a relatively unimportant piece of data to your subconscious mind when your subconscious mind feels like you can succeed at your chosen purpose based on its calculations you feel energized excited focused single minded and determined your body language tone of voice and demeanor become that of a confident person you do not need to read a book or website to tell you how to act confidently you just naturally feel and act confidently our subconscious minds evolved to recognize confidence so other people will know you are confident as well if i put a suitcase with a million dollars in a trashcan across the street and you knew for a fact that there were no obstacles to you going and grabbing that suitcase you would confidently grab it you would run with vigor excitement and joy you would not be timid anxious or care what anybody thought you wouldn t think much or get distracted or worry if you were doing the wrong thing you would just do it on the other hand if your subconscious mind feels like there is a threat on the way to the goal you are pursuing or that there may be a better goal you could pursue you feel anxious anxiety freezes you to force you to reassess the path you are on when seized by anxiety you feel timid low energy and stressed like something is preventing you from moving your mind also switches into rumination mode cycling through distractions and doubts because it is trying to figure out what to do next when seized by anxiety your subconscious mind will constantly create excuses for you to not pursue the goal because it is certain you will fail you will worry about what people think because deep down you think they may be right again this is all a natural automatic response even if your conscious brain knows on an intellectual level that you are on the right path if your subconscious brain thinks you are doing the wrong thing it will cripple you although we like to think of ourselves as rational intellectual beings in reality our rational mind is a relatively new and weak appendage that sits on top of a much larger stronger and sophisticated subconscious lizard mind that evolved over millions of years while our rational mind can only process about pieces of information at a time and pay attention to only a few things at once our subconscious mind can process hundreds of thousands of pieces of information from a vast array of internal and external inputs and because our subconscious mind is so much more sophisticated than our conscious mind it is generally stronger and usually gets it way put another way humans are primarily emotional beings and most of what we do is controlled by our subconscious mind your subconscious is like a different person living inside of you with a completely separate set of desires thoughts fears and perceptions from your conscious mind our rational mind can guide and tutor our subconscious mind but deeply changing the subconscious mind is a long and difficult process there are also some changes you just cannot make you can t for example just completely turn off your desire for food or sex our subconscious mind also subtly influences our rational mind s thoughts we often make rational justifications for the emotions generated by our subconscious mind by means of a process called confabulation an example of confabulation would be an alcoholic justifying to themselves why one more drink wouldn t hurt an even better example is our subconscious mind making excuses as to why we shouldn t approach a beautiful intimidating woman even though we think we are thinking clearly our thoughts are actually warped by our subconscious mind even worse many thoughts never even reach our conscious minds because our subconscious mind blocks them understanding anxiety from a neurological perspective anxiety is not one thing rather it is a set of alarms that go off when your subconscious mind detects threats these alarms are hierarchically arranged by sophistication at the bottom of this hierarchy is the oldest part of your brain the periaqueductal grey which generates panic in the case of an immediate threat it is the least sophisticated of the anxiety alarms and is designed to give a quick imprecise low resolution signal while the more sophisticated parts of your brain are trying to figure out what is going on above the periaqueductal grey is the medial hypothalamus which governs more sophisticated responses to threats like devising a plan to escape above the medial hypothalamus sits the amygdala which generates an even more sophisticated emotional representation of the threat and at the top of this hierarchy sits your frontal cortex the rational conscious part of your brain which is the most sophisticated of all each layer of this hierarchy can inhibit the lower layers which creates an efficient system after sensing a potential threat the lower levels immediately set off an alarm which is then checked by more sophisticated parts of your brain if the more sophisticated layers determine that the potential threat is benign they shut off the alarm generated by the lower layers for example if you are alone in your apartment at night and hear a loud noise you may feel startled because your periaqueductal grey getting you ready for fight or flight but if you turn around and see that the sound was caused by a book falling to the floor the more sophisticated parts of your subconscious mind will realize that the sensed threat was not a real threat and they will therefore shut off the alarm and inhibit your fight or flight response but if you turn around and see an axe murdered in your apartment the sophisticated parts of your subconscious mind will realize that your periaqueductal grey was right and you need to get running or fighting your anxiety circuit also generates alarms when you are faced with uncertainty or with multiple competing goals remember the purpose of anxiety is to help you figure out the correct path while anxiety is necessary to protect you from threats it becomes a problem when the conscious sophisticated parts of your mind do not shut off the alarms when the alarms do not have merit constant alarms make you feel like shit stressed timid weak crippled and unable to make progress towards your goals they also sap your energy and enthusiasm paradoxically when anxiety stops you from making progress towards your goals you end up failing to collect the very information that anxiety wants you to collect worst of all because your anxiety circuits are constantly registering false alarms where none exist your subconscious mind is constantly eliminating possible paths from consideration even before they reach your conscious mind making you an ever more fearful person your anxiety system can go haywire for a variety of reasons you have so much chaos and uncertainty in your life that too many threat alarms are going off and your conscious mind doesn t have the time and energy to individually respond to each alarm so the alarms just persistently stay on or the alarms have been going off for so long that they have hijacked your conscious mind to think that the threats are real even when they are not your conscious mind only has so much bandwidth and if the threats are coming in faster than you can respond to them they just accumulate and you end up with a general sense of dread about everything and when you don t respond to the things that are setting off anxiety alarms within you and instead choose to avoid them that causes you subconscious mind to assume that those things really are threats anxiety ultimately becomes a vicious cycle that keeps getting worse and worse to take a conservative approach to our safety nature causes humans and most animals to have an over active anxiety system apparently evolution determined that it was better to have false positives rather than false negatives if you have a false alarm in the jungle i e your anxiety wrongly registers something as a threat you may miss out on a tasty treat but if you have a false negative your anxiety misses an actual threat you may get eaten by a lion which is much worse while the conservative approach to anxiety alarms was a good evolutionary strategy for more primitive animals the over active anxiety system creates real problems for humans because we live in a complex society where many of the threats are abstract complicated and may not occur until years into the future training your subconscious mind to see opportunity there are three primary methods to train your subconscious mind to see opportunity and success where it previously saw threats exposure therapy self improvement and autosuggestion exposure therapy the best way to train your subconscious mind to feel confident when pursuing a goal is to actually succeed when your subconscious mind sees you succeed at something it is much more likely to generate confidence the next time you try to do that thing for example most people feel confident they will succeed at brushing their teeth because they have successfully brushed their teeth many times in the past an expert carpenter will feel confident when doing carpentry because he has successfully done it many times in the past and so on your subconscious mind may also base its confidence on analogous data for example in a novel situation your subconscious mind may think i have never faced a situation exactly like this but i have successfully faced similar situations in the past and those previous situations were similar enough to make me feel confident i can succeed in this situation as well your subconscious mind might even think i ve generally succeeded at novel and uncertain tasks in the past and i feel like i am a pretty competent intelligent and strong person so even though i have not quite faced this exact situation in the past i am confident i will succeed here as well to feel confidence your subconscious mind needs to see a clear road to the finish line which requires you to generate a plan and a routine in your life that minimizes threat and uncertainty and provides a clear consistent stream of wins as you pursue your goals if your subconscious mind thinks the plan you created is too difficult and the wins too remote you will feel unmotivated so you will need to re adjust your plan and your definition of win to make the make the wins feel more attainable for example if a particular task or plan is too intimidating to your subconscious mind you can generate confidence by breaking it into smaller less intimidating tasks that your subconscious mind feels like you can do for example if you are intimidated by the prospect of writing a paper you can start by just opening your word processor and typing a word your subconscious mind may doubt that you can write a paper but it knows you can type a word so you will feel motivated to take that first step and type a word once your subconscious mind sees you succeed at typing a word then you may feel enough confidence to type a sentence and so forth similarly if you are too anxious to approach a woman you can start with smaller tasks such as just saying hi or asking them the time i have found the key to success is continually humbling yourself and re categorizing as wins small things that provide you just some incremental progress those incremental steps quickly add up similarly therapists often recommend exposure therapy is the most common cure for anxiety self improvement self improvement boosts your confidence by giving your subconscious new data by which to calculate your chances of success you want your subconscious mind to think we are not the same person that got rejected before so we will not get rejected this time part of the reason women love shopping is that it makes them feel confident by buying new clothes they reprogram their subconscious mind to think well now people will like me of course on a rational level a new set of clothes is usually not enough to make people change their opinion of you but that rational analysis does not matter to the subconscious mind it feels confident because the data is now different you can improve yourself in many ways including by lifting eating better dressing better using better hygiene etc you can learn how to do these things in other articles so the only point i will make here is that you can motivate yourself to pursue these purposes just like you would motivate yourself to do anything break it up into smaller more attainable wins and create a plan and routine that gives you a steady stream of those wins autosuggestion and delusion self help gurus philosophers and mystics have long known that you can reprogram your subconscious mind by feeding it positive data in the form of affirmations mantras prayers or meditations this form of reprogramming is called autosuggestion suggesting to yourself you are more competent strong and able to succeed than you previously felt you were for autosuggestion to work you must consistently tell yourself these affirmations over a long period of time repetition is necessary because your subconscious mind needs a lot of data to change its opinion on your chances of success the affirmations must be detailed and connected to emotion remember the affirmations are for your subconscious mind which operates on emotion whenever a negative thought pops into your head you must defeat it with a positive thought the more tangible and real the data the more likely your subconscious will be convinced for example gurus and therapists often tell you to repeat your affirmations out loud or write them down some even suggest writing yourself fake apology letters from people who have harmed you even though your conscious mind knows those letters are fake your subconscious mind will often be tricked into feeling better you can also daydream by fantasizing and visualizing yourself succeeding at a particular task your subconscious mind will feel more confident when actually performing that task obviously autosuggestion is a much weaker way to reprogram your subconscious mind than actual success your subconscious mind evolved to reject fake data so just saying something to yourself is much weaker than seeing it actually happen nevertheless mountains of data scientific historical and anecdotal suggest that fake data can trick our subconscious mind and generate new mental states religions cults art and superstitions work because of this principle religious people often feel closer to god as a result because their subconscious mind thinks that the master of universe will favor them because they spoke some magic words think that s stupid well if you ve ever cried during a movie the same thing happened to you too one of the strangest manifestations of autosuggestion is when people start believing their own lies even if they knew they were lying in the beginning after they tell the lie enough times their own subconscious mind starts to believe it scammers and cult leaders sometimes fall for their own tricks governments and public relations have also learned that you can make people crazy things by simple repetition for autosuggestion to work your conscious mind must be on board if you say the words i know i will succeed while your conscious mind thinks i am lying to myself i can t do it autosuggestion will fail confidence is a combination of feeling and intellect so while you do not necessarily need to believe your affirmations you cannot think they are false autosuggestion works best when you are about to embark on an uncertain path where you anything can happen and you convince yourself to feel like something good will happen autosuggestion fails when you are just lying to yourself and you know you are lying articulating and facing your anxiety despite the steps described here to improve confidence you may still feel anxiety in certain situations because you have no data to demonstrate to your subconscious mind that you will succeed all the data seems to indicate you will fail or you are faced with genuine uncertainty when you feel anxiety you must articulate your anxiety in words to rationally determine what if any threats your subconscious mind is sensing take a deep breath step back and ask yourself what exactly am i afraid will happen if i try to do this to answer this question you may need to think deeply and brainstorm because it may not be immediately obvious to your rational mind why your subconscious mind is feeling anxiety the mere act of articulating your anxiety can reduce your anxiety because it transforms a vague hazy undefined fear in your mind into a specific manageable threat you can articulate a plan against once you actually articulate in words the things you are afraid of you often realize the threats are not as scary as you originally felt after you articulate threats in words you can face them and formulate a plan to defeat them the plan might be keep going and don t worry about this threat or keep going and do x thing to neutralize the threat or the threat is real and substantial so you should take another path in any event once you have a plan that leads you to the goal and deals with threats that on the way there you will feel more confident your anxiety circuit is not necessarily concerned that threats exist it cares more whether you have a plan to defeat the threats therefore you feel much less anxiety when you voluntarily confront the threats rather than when they unexpectedly come at you articulate threats and formulate a plan to defeat them may sound like obvious advice but most people do not follow these steps and their anxiety remains in the mysterious hazy unarticulated realm of emotion when most people feel anxiety they just give up and decide to go do something else they don t examine what caused their anxiety or how to overcome those causes they just feel bad and go do something easy to feel good like drugs alcohol video games etc most people blindly follow their anxiety to stay safe which actually does often work but causes them to miss many opportunities when they actually could have overcome the threats articulating one s anxiety is often terrifying because it forces people to confront their weaknesses if a man is afraid to approach women the threat blocking his path to the goal may be that he is fat out of shape dressed horribly stupid uninteresting etc articulating and admitting these problems will be painful and facing his anxiety would require him to fix those problems which is not easy most people ignore their problems and leave them in the ether so they do not need to think about them or admit they exist i have met many guys who convinced themselves they are amazing with women but are afraid to approach probably because if they fail at approaching they must face the fact that they are not actually that great with women to defeat anxiety you must believe that it is actually possible to create and articulate a plan to overcome any threat in other words you must believe the world is govern by rational rules you can understand those rules and you can use those rules to succeed anxiety becomes crippling when we see obstacles as immovable and undefeatable our fat uninteresting friend who sucks with women cannot even imagine there are actual steps he can take to improve so he just never does it ignoring your anxiety in his quest to vanquish his anxiety our hero has performed a variety of exercises to train his subconscious mind to no longer feel anxiety but even after such training our hero sometimes still feels anxiety which he deals with by articulating and facing his anxieties nevertheless even after articulating and facing his anxieties some anxiety may remain this is usually because our hero is faced with a genuinely uncertain and novel situation he has no data to demonstrate that he can succeed nor does he have any data as to what the threats actually are his anxiety almost is almost completely composed of the fear of the unknown at this point our hero has only one option left ignore his anxiety and blindly jump into the unknown i could have started this article by just saying ignore your anxiety and in fact most books and articles in this genre just say ignore your anxiety or ignore negative thoughts and just plow ahead but that doesn t always work anxiety is a valuable evolutionary tool that exists for a reason and if we ignore it we can get ourselves into deep trouble and miss opportunities to correct our behavior it s not a coincidence that drugs that reduce our anxiety like alcohol and marijuana often cause us to act stupidly our natural alarm system that protects us from threats has been turned off you should only ignore your anxiety when we have trained it articulated it and faced it in other words you should only ignore our anxiety when you are confident it has nothing valuable to say otherwise no matter how much we try to repress or ignore our anxiety part of us will worry that our anxiety is right that that nagging feeling may actually be warning us of a real threat i have found that sometimes when you try to ignore your anxiety it only becomes louder probably because something in your brain senses that you are ignoring your anxiety obviously you cannot spend every moment of your life articulating and thinking about your anxieties for each particular threat you only need to articulate and face the anxiety associated with that threat once and then use that confidence going forward for example for approaching women you need to sit one time and really think to yourself what is so scary about rejection and what you can do to minimize that threat but you complete this exercise you no longer need to think about the negative effects of rejection every time you consider approaching a beautiful woman faith the key to managing your anxiety is faith we live in an infinitely complicated constantly changing universe that is littered with infinite threats some of which we know about and some of which we do not there is no possible way that we can think about face and articulate every possible threat we simply do not have enough time or mental energy therefore we need to have a general faith that everything is going to be ok and only think about and respond to important threats that exceed a certain threshold of seriousness at any particular moment a wide variety of terrible things you can happen to you you could get struck down by lighting you could get cancer a plane could crash on you your company could fail and get fired etc most of these dangers are technically threats but they are not likely enough for you to worry therefore you must ignore them most of the things you worry about never happen so you might as well have never worried about them in my personal life i try to follow the following rules i ignore all threats unless there is some compelling reason to focus my attention on a particular threat or threats i consider each threat as minimally threatening as i possibly can given the data that i have and i only focus on one threat at a time unless i absolutely must spread my attention over multiple threats in other words i try to minimize the seriousness of any threat until the data is overwhelmingly clear otherwise i only respond to anxiety alarms that are very loud and even then i try to shut the alarm off as quickly as possible to some of you this approach may sound unsafe or overly risky but it makes logical sense first as a practical matter you only have the mental ability to focus on and respond to one threat at a time anyway so at any particular moment you have no choice but to ignore all threats except for the most serious and pertinent ones even then you can t spend all day responding to threats so you need long stretches of time where you just ignore threats completely second unless you have concrete data that a particular threat is real imminent and dangerous there is no rational reason you should worry about it third if you are facing an uncertain situation where you are not sure about the seriousness of the threat you must use whatever data you have for example i invest my money pretty conservatively because even though each individual investment has an uncertain outcome i have collected enough data in my life to generally know that most investments will fail most business plans are shit and most people are overly optimistic about their businesses so i only invest money if i have a clear reason to believe that the venture will make money for this approach to work you need to do your homework collect data and face your threats squarely when you detect them if i do not collect data about investing and on top of that i ignore whatever threats i do see i will lose my money every time i do not ignore threats so i can live my life like a blissful retard i ignore them so i can focus on the ones that actually matter the aftermath of course no situation remains uncertain forever sometimes you blindly jump into a novel situation with fake confidence and fail that s ok every time you fail you get access to new data with which you can fix your existing issues and retrain your subconscious mind to feel confident imagine you approach a woman and she rejects you most people will take that data as evidence that they will always fail at approaching women so they will just stop approaching but if you get rejected you should rationally analyze your approach and figure out what you did wrong of course sometimes its not clear why she rejected you and if you do a thorough analysis of the data and cannot figure out what happened you should just not worry about it you should also always assume that your mistake was as small as possible you cannot let your imagine run wild with thoughts about how terrible you are again unless you have compelling evidence to the contrary you should assume you did nothing wrong my website
16820,posted originally on mrp as part of dod tldr lots of words here death while it is inevitable its mystery vast like the deepest reaches of the universe its dark presence cast a long darker shadow over me hah just kidding i can write engagingly about things not related to death i ll show you but first to make for some smooth easy reading here s a table of contents part introduction strengths and weaknesses your mindset starting a business the mechanics part good resources what would i do some additional pointers part the mechanics and perhaps tools part a content business in an internet business in auditing measuring understanding scaling your business quality assurance so important failing boo hoo succeeding introduction i would like to tell you that owning a business or even owning businesses and succeeding is the most rewarding thing in the world and so so much better than working a job for someone else the only reason i can t tell you that is because i never experienced the latter i ve been my own man since day one with that said i can tell you that being a founder a ceo and starting failing succeeding and running the show is an amazing experience it s a great adventure and you re the writer producer director and star if you love what you do if you love being in the trenches then there s nothing better getting paid perhaps even handsomely to do what you love and getting to do it your own way this is intended to be a very hands on guide with examples and in part if there s interest actual tools and documents we use what s more to facilitate your own business building i will walk you through some of the things you should be aware of perhaps then you can avoid the multitude of mistakes and failures i did not avoid maybe you can do it bigger better and faster that s a beautiful thing understanding your strengths and weaknesses and why it matters spend time learning about your strengths and weaknesses as mrp suggests be honest and objective now is not the time for delusion i d get others perspectives to answer these question for you as well in order to succeed you must be honest with yourself you must lose the ego as every tom dick and harry has already told you and you must intimately understand what you re actually good at and what you re actually not good at are you a sales guy a problem solver a leader a good manager a critical thinker a product guy importantly what aren t you journal this a bit for a few reasons first you ll better determine where your focus should be second you ll understand where you need help third you ll have your first glimpse of insight regarding how you ll potentially sell yourself in the future to investors should you choose that road or that road choose you what were my strengths in the beginning highly motivational strong problem solving skills natural sales inspiring leadership i was willing to put everything into it i simply would not give up what were my weaknesses then lack of discipline self delusion i was a stubborn mother fucker shitty manager no understanding of business fundamentals missed deadlines often how have i progressed slowly today i still excel where i once did but i am now the most disciplined mother fucker out there and while i may still have an outsized perspective of self at least i m aware of it and more importantly i m aware of the downside and potential to be blindsided by such strong self belief what s more i m no longer so stubborn unless my gut tells me to be so and i have a vast understanding of the fundamentals of business i m a very good manager and profoundly obsessed with getting better every day and i d rather my wife chew off one of my testicles than miss a deadline some of my inherent strengths have helped me immensely though be aware that your greatest strengths can sometimes paradoxically be your most impactful weaknesses challenges perhaps the nickname i had david koresh indicated that i truly was a great motivator inspiring leadership and someone who d never give up or perhaps as one cto told me it simply meant that i was a monster and a tyrant i recently saw the documentary about waco and i m not so sure which is true my year year education occurred not in a classroom but in the real world of founding building growing failing and succeeding with businesses multiple times there are pros and cons to that what i learned has been astounding the depth the broad strokes the specific skills all of it that said i wish for instance that i had taken say one business class ever i wish too i had learned earlier that the fastest way to get from one room to another is not to run charging with your head down to blow open the door but instead to simply turn the handle and walk through the doorway wishes notwithstanding i have no regrets nor should you regret is for assholes but it s important to know your actual strengths and weaknesses i never went thought this exercise in the beginning and as a result i did not play to my strengths and work on my weaknesses instead i stubbornly walked my own path when there were plenty of better smarter more efficient paths to walk what took six years my first monumental failure could have taken one how you can progress much faster do this exercise plan accordingly and hire so that you can focus your efforts where they belong avoid focusing your skills in the wrong area and automate or delegate literally everything else your mindset do you want investors or do you want to make a nice little business or perhaps have a side gig it doesn t matter the plan should be the same i d encourage you to think that your primary goal is to sell your company within months for a lot of fucking money and that it will require and benefit from investors along the way why because most businesses fail if i recall correctly for every one business that works four don t and i m not talking about teslas microsofts and googles i m talking about landscaping companies consultants mechanics coffee shops and the like your chances of failing are greater than your chances of succeeding it s that simple that s why you should be into it from the very beginning no half measures and no half assing it once you let half measures and half assing into the equation you re chances of failing some time grow that much bigger if you can pass muster at shark tank your chances of succeeding are better if you can get an a round in the door your chances of succeeding are better if you can convince five smart guys to be on your board your chances of succeeding are better if you sell your company your chances of succeeding are better why and this will sound a little familiar because you ve put in the work you ve addressed the fundamentals you have a good plan you ideally have traction you have a vision if you re in a position to use your experience share your solid business plan show traction and convince others then you already have some key foundational strategies built you re one step closer to achieving your goals and building or selling your business even if you never do have investors or actually sell those fundamentals that savvy accredited investors require are required for a reason and no business should ignore them in my strong opinion the single best resource out there for how best to get this right can be found by googling the brief for investors find the n f x site and paying particular attention to the section regarding traction by getting these strategies to land money and sell just right you are in the right mindset again even if you don t get investors or sell yourself ever ten years ago i would have told you that the mindset was you have it you know you have it no one else does and that you were going to win period i still believe it and think it helps i feel this way all the time but that s not the right strategy for everyone and further i m in my s now and understand that i can leverage that feeling while integrating sound fundamentals if you have to pick one versus the other sound fundamentals will always prevail i think you should go into things with a sober perspective of course if you re in a really competitive cut throat environment like i am then you do need a big bite along with that bark and the reality is every business no matter size is in a competitive environment and as the pandemic continues to unfold automation keeps taking hold and machine learning expands the competition everywhere will get that much harder that said i believe now is the best possible time to start a business so much change so much opportunity it s a brave new world and that world needs new ideas new strategies new services and new products starting a business starting a business can be fun exciting and adventurous at the same time it can be born of necessity the outcome of negative circumstances or perhaps like many now face the only chance you believe you have left since the job market is in deep shit from my experience the starting phrase is highly rewarding whether you succeed or fail most of my fondest memories come from this phase the most memorable of all from this phase for those companies i founded that failed go forth with the following in mind build your own brief as outlined above focused on traction and actually create every one of those items give yourself a whole quarter if you need to skip the fucking pressure contrary to what every newb founder believes no one s about to launch your product or steal your idea and if they actually are then you re ten steps behind anyway watch every single investor video at the brief site those are real world investors telling you exactly what they look for don t build your company around what you look for build it around what they look for if you rely on a paycheck don t jump too soon put together a plan implement a smart strategy and test before you go elsewhere the test is the most important damn thing because it moves you from fantasy land what you believe to reality what customers will pay for read nail it then scale it while there are others of the same ilk this is the best of them learn and understand and become intimately acquainted with its concepts especially when it comes to that test i mentioned find that minimum viable product mvp fast the fastest most cost efficient minimum product you can sell and succeed with if it will take time to build then simply create the messaging around it if it s a service and you can roll your mvp out the door tomorrow examine the competition and find your competitive edge what differentiates you versus them build around that competitive edge address the pain points the industry has even if your market is saturated that does not mean that customers within the market are satisfied chances are they re not conceptualize your product or build your messaging or massage your service to play to those needs those pain points and those gaps in the market test your mvp google adwords is essentially the greatest vehicle for testing the world has ever seen don t even have a product even better because that means as a startup dude you didn t fall in love with your product didn t spend a fortune on it and didn t end up frittering away time and money only to learn that no one else likes your stupid fucking product still test just test a fake product one that happens to not yet exist and track your performance carefully through google adwords don t skimp on google adwords and don t do it yourself get someone to help that someone can be relatively inexpensive and found online think upwork fivver etc don t fall in love with your product your product is probably not even what you think your product is just ask stewart butterfield he loves video games but i imagine he loves being a billionaire more twice and he s a canadian like stoney how bout them apples don t fear your idea getting out that fear is very common it inflicted me early on you lose much much more than you gain by keeping things painfully close to the vest most of all you lose perspective valuable perspective real world perspective perspective that is not your own fucking perspective perhaps if you re an executive at google ready to move to apple then the advice might be different but i m confident you dear reader are not an executive at google ready to move to apple read getting things done while you re at it the two most effective people i ve ever hired both independently recommended the book to me and while i d already read it prior to those recommendations it is still fantastic and something i revisit every few years your ability to be a successful manager will help you more than you can ever imagine dotting i s and crossing t s while sounding boring is the first step toward successfully managing people and projects and unless you re planning to raise money steal the money and abscond to the beaches of mexico you re going to spend a lot of time managing people and managing projects this book will help you improve every single day focus on learning how to hire well hiring is so important it cannot be overstated the most important part of hiring train well and fire fast so many new business owners and gaytrepeneurs take way too long to let people go one mistake no problem ten well he ll learn right fuck that spell out the rules and when they re broken put it in writing break em three times and they re out the door make sure your employment agreement and your employee handbook spell these things out clearly up front be straightforward as fuck with everyone you hire do the exact opposite of sugar coating in the end employees will greatly appreciate it finally get everything in writing and be painfully clear up front about everything leave nothing to chance especially if you re going into business with an associate a colleague or a friend or if you re getting money or if you re planning to have customers if you think you re being too clear and straightforward be even more so ambiguity during the startup phase is not your friend and in so many circumstances the other side will win when it comes to a lack of clarity avoid the following perfectionism pedantries embellishment ambiguity self delusion ignoring everything else in life because your identity is now directly tied to the outcome of your business incessantly telling everyone at all times about your amazing game changing stupid ass business thinking you are right about everything because well you re fucking not with some of the basics covered things to pursue and things to avoid it s time to dig into the proper mechanics needed to help your business thrive the mechanics do you know how to build a business do you know what to measure do you know what to pay attention to and what to ignore do you know your leading indicators your trailing indicators if you don t no big deal i had no fucking idea myself for the first ten years of my career alas i m going to tell you show you and give you some fun tools to play with the latter part contingent upon getting any interest from our dear readers so if you want hands on examples of things i m talking about below let me know in the comments or by dm and i ll include them in part two as you surely know the main priority of a business is to make money everything else is secondary to that though the secondary elements can be quite important help the world feed the poor produce sustainability etc but first you need to make money you re going to need the proper tools to maximize your chances bookkeeping xero is inexpensive and you ll avoid getting caught in the shitty intuit software trap calendar easy google calendar or exchange or whatever works though it must be shareable note taking i live in the world of note taking i notate everything and because ideas can come at different and interesting times i ve setup my system to accommodate my needs i am hooked on ms onenote even though from a mobile perspective it is weak compared to evernote or keep which i also use and i have google homes everywhere bedroom office home office bathroom car etc your ability to jot down what you re thinking at any time is important in this case simply speaking your mind anywhere and at any time is uber effective basic office google docs docs and sheets portable mobile friendly shareable api available project management basecamp monday asana etc comms something extensible that works everywhere slack is good microsoft teams is probably good too with these tools you need to build the fundamentals starting with the brief and the deck mentioned above including financials and recognizing that if you re a tech startup then they re often nothing more than a shot in the dark so simply emulate the closest public tech company s numbers or even better find a similar startup s deck online and copy their financials once you have that in place you need to focus on being organized punctual and methodical in your daily behavior and especially in your management what will you need nda amp non compete employee handbook employment agreements customer agreements terms of use policy management dashboard vision mission plan initiatives tracking agendas those nine items represent the tools i mention above and you can operate a business with these be strict in getting everything in writing and make sure all your legalize serves its one purpose covering your ass i ve spent a goddamn fortune on attorneys and have every damn sentence paragraph section and document running on all cylinders to simply cover my ass more on the mechanics starting on day one and i promise this will make you a much better business man for the rest of your life treat every single task as an opportunity to improve and build your future empire what s more allocate to more time to get the task done thoroughly as opposed to quickly instead of creating a task like this create a report do the following instead create an adwords performance report showing traction kpis start date today due date six days from now description create this report to show leads calls goals automatically compared to last week last month last quarter and last year integrate between google adwords and google data studio dependency setup google data studio account dependency screencast in loom observers claudia tom link agenda tags reports adwords data studio loom training video management estimated time hours actual time tbd why are you doing this as opposed to half assing it writing the task as fast as you can to get it done and then simply launching into it because you need a report so that means you ll almost certainly need the same report in the future you may need to do this report this time but you want to delegate it to someone in the future so the loom video capturing everything you do is the ultimate training session and finally your goal should be to a automate and b delegate everything so rather than treating this as a one off task treat it as an opportunity to build standard operating procedures sop for the future for the next time someone who s not you needs to get it done this methodical approach to getting things done memorializing them converting to training building sops and thinking ahead will take more time in the here and now but next month when you ve trained a hour guy to build the next report follow the same sop or do something similar then you ve saved yourself a fuck ton of time and beautifully you are now scaling aka winning in that vein there are two more important tools zoom for video conferencing always incorporate video and recording to further enable training loom screencasting to train and help delegate these tools help you be more effective and better enable you to focus on growing reminding you again to automate and delegate everything other than what your company truly needs you to do in the next part i will talk about quality assurance which is arguably the most important aspect of scaling your company s growth and how the ideas mentioned above tie into it so that some practical every day advice i ll go into greater detail on these mechanics and potentially tools in part two there are a few other things you can learn i ve bolded the really important ones from books and articles i ve read over the years books and articles i ve read getting things done nail it then scale it the lean startup influence the psychology of persuasion the feeling good handbook especially helpful if you re failing rainmaking conversations influence science and practice crossing the chasm the art of delegation the power of business process improvement capital in the st century the leadership challenge profits aren t everything they re the only thing empowerment takes more than a minute blue ocean strategy learned optimism helpful for me when i was tackling anhedonia harvard business review this has been the most helpful for me agile methodology my companies migrated all departments to agile last year it s been a significant change while i was a natural salesman i never learned anything about sales or even business so i also read scores of sales books from the old gurus like zig zigler in my darkest of days after a business failed i ordered some tony robbins stuff and while there was plenty of gaudy pageantry it was extraordinarily beneficial it s also a big part of the reason i believe so much in cognitive behavioral therapy cbt and have made its practice a routine daily almost instinctive habit so with all this knowledge how would i go about spending that in my pocket what do i do right off the bat i m breaking the rules and spending but that s okay because my companies have deep pockets and the to ratio if not low is legitimate and still stands for spend very little to test and prove i don t have to envision a potential scenario because i m going through this right now this is precisely what i m doing first some background a few years back for a new company i raised figures on an figure valuation convinced i could build a figure company and confident i would build a figure company then the crazy ass disease i d been dealing with morphed into damn near certain death and things well they delayed and progressed rather slowly however i pivoted and although i was really kind of fucked for damn near three years i have been turning it around and moving in the right direction with it as my other companies have done surprisingly well and made insane progress overall though in every sense of the word it has been a challenge but while doing so like the aforementioned stewart butterfield i stumbled upon something intriguing a business from within a business that itself had started from one of my other businesses in the realm of machine learning robotic process automation and ai i dug into it noted no intellectual property issues no patents knew it was a big deal so here is exactly what i m doing and i encourage you to copy this this strategy incorporates years of my experience into one solid play building out a quick generically branded website with a general name not associated with any other companies i own developing two marketing strategies going after prospective customers in our industry who d benefit from this and going after agencies in general who d love to leverage what we re doing running google adwords campaigns for both to prove that people will bite in the following prioritized way pay for something take the next step e g i want more information or express interest since i don t have a product built yet and since it s not going to impact my actual companies my team will simply reach out to buyers and this is a goddamn great idea so there will be buyers and tell them we cannot fulfill right now but to stay on our mailing list to be notified when we re ready then these same people will also become my pilots i ll iteratively build the product around solving their needs at the same time develop a feasibility study by hiring a few external specialists to analyze a couple areas of our suggested product that do not yet exist four areas exist now the fifth is not monetized and available only by opensource the sixth does not exist outside of the original research paper it s the combination of the six that represents our unique product offering file a patent application this is not the balls to the wall version that will cost me not yet justified to spend major dollars to be real but it s holding our place in line create a second video showing the product in action and not one of those stupid fucking cartoon character explainer videos those are juvenile ridiculous and to be avoided put together a brief just like what i referenced above showing the traction associated with our pilot study campaigns the results of our feasibility study for integrating all six technology paths and the intellectual property patent data and then raise money my guess i ll get million on a million valuation if the feasibility studies are favorable which may or may not happen note that i m spending little money to test something on a small scale you must get traction and move from i believe people will buy my product to people bought my product or at least tried to regardless of whether you fulfilled or not you have proven the demand is there and that has extreme value some final pointers don t tell anyone how much money you make ever except your grandmother if your grandfather s dead emigrated here with twenty bucks in his pocket had a life long dream and didn t fulfill it but you did then you can tell your grandmother thankfully i learned the don t tell people how much money you make mantra early my family felt strongly that doing so is tacky and in poor taste it s hard to effectively describe what an enormous downside there is to employees colleagues friends family members wives and others even having an inkling it s not good in ways you would never expect prioritize your health and fitness first and bake that into your business strategies and mindset never stop learning while i dropped out of college the education i ve had over the years has been more like phd s ba s and more of the bs the real world my friends is where it s at avoid the temptation to become an over educated nerd learning does not necessarily equal education don t hire your relatives even someone like me who has hired scores of relatives well i can tell you that it never turns out well sometimes you learn that quickly sometimes it takes a long ass time but in my experience it s a bad idea same thing for friends and good god did i hire a lot of them early on like dumbshit trump i thought loyalty and trust were paramount and essentially ignored everything else e g experience qualifications expertise etc just like with family above of the time it ended poorly well no that s not true there s one exception one of my inhouse attorneys started that way but what he does is very straightforward don t fucking go into business with your wife holy hell if you have done so already please chime into this thread and tell me about it i d rather put a bullet in my brain than endure that torture but it s my understanding that dudes out there actually pursue such a strategy sheeit don t express your political opinions to your customers ever if your customer base is all republicans or all democrats then you can make an exception otherwise you ll turn off a significant number of prospective customers with your rhetoric don t sleep with or fuck around with your staff ever in fact you d do well to learn all the goddamn rules about sensitivity training in general especially in the particularly litigious good old usa don t disparage your competitors i can almost assure that you ll be the only one in your entire industry to take such a stance there s a big group of people who appreciate that focus on customer service and transparency mastering those two skillsets is better than the most amazing sales and marketing campaign you can create be organized and hone your own fantastic management skills if they re not yet fantastic make them fantastic i did i promise you that being able to manage you your time your projects your tasks your calendar your employees your outsourcers and doing so with discipline is vital to your success and it s all about kpis key performance indicators remember by virtue of starting a company you are diving into the ceo role and a ceo without management skills is basically nothing or the wework loser live and in the flesh always always always do what you say you ll do early on i didn t i had my own vision of time frames and they were often at odds with reality s own vision of time frames usually by about people in the world of business absolutely love dudes who do what they say they ll do every time all the time conversely dudes who don t get a reputation and that reputation is not a good one finally learn to separate up time from down time and don t stew over what s happening with your business your business is not you a knock on your product is not a knock on you and go into assuming that in the world of business people are assholes all the damn time because i have spent my entire career working with high net worth megalomaniacal assholes the ages of say to were challenging for me these dudes are tough and i let them negatively impact plenty of weekends vacations trips across the world christmas days new years eves and the like and i took it personally and it really got under my skin while i ve grown out of being bothered by it you would do well to never be bothered by it at all from day one and instead view it as part of the process of living growing and evolving so that wraps up part i ll be posting part in the next couple of days if you have questions or comments ask away edit brief for investors is at thecompanybrief dot com and

and so started my sex ventures if you re more interesting a quick run down of what works rather than the detailed narrative that includes how s why s i recommend you skip to the section entitled young sexy man the breakdown if you doubt anything i say and i know a lot of you mothafuckas think every field report is a work of fiction just click on the hyperlinks i include in my report without further adue let s get you laid brother warning this post contains photos of censored partial nudity this thread is for adults only origin story in elementary school i was the ring leader of the neighborhood kids we played soldier with toy guns everyday and i was the leader of my team every time whenever all my friends were outside and i was at home they would all run to my house and practically drag me out to come play with them it wasn t a complete day without me around even the older kids respected me this instilled into me an acclimation to being the guy everybody wanted to have on their team the guy everybody wanted to be friends with and the guy everybody relied on it was a good start to life that i m sorry many other men didn t get the chance to experience no matter because my advice is implementable no matter how you started off my family moved when i went to middle school so i lost all of my friends fortunately one of my older brothers always seemed to know how to be cool in highschool and i learned alot thanks to him he started bringing over girls in the th grade to hang out with him and i would run into them talk and end up making a new connection eventually i had cute girls to talk to on the bus which bought me brownie points with the guys on the bus and that s how my beginning friendships formed in the th grade th and th grade was a typical kid experience and th grade is where the fun finally began the start of an empire i along with every other hip year old had jumped from myspace to facebook and created an account using a fake birth date we would all post nonsensical kid writings and funny pictures until one day i realized my friends rarely commented on my stuff and i them so i texted one of them and said hey man how come you never engage with my posts and he replied idk dude i dont really realize it so i had the bright idea to propose exchanging comments likes with each other i then repeated the conversation with another friend and another eventually i had a group of solid bros who would all like and comment on my shit and the girls on my friends list took notice i mentioned my idea to some of those older girls my brother brought over who have now moved on to college and while they weren t too keen on having random middleschoolers as friends they quickly changed their mind when i reminded them we would soon be freshman and i m sure they wouldn t mind the extra attention with the girls now involved i had a co ed circle of people actively engaging in my comments in addition to the randoms acquaintances who hopped on the bandwagon everybody loves a winner i suppose i theorize that if you get like that s all you ll get but if you get likes you ll get more from randoms this small investment in middle school would end up paying dividends in high school eventually as most suburban kids i get invited to train marijuana i was reluctant at first so i asked my older brother who smoked and he said to try it out and see if i liked it it was awesome this led me to start smoking with my brother who introduced me to his connection weedman tom weedman tom was a tall round glasses wearing hippy and boy was he coool after the th time meeting him he added me on facebook and that s when he noticed my online popularity you got a lot of friends man he said to me yeah i do i replied you know if any of them smoke weed i have street smarts and i knew where this was heading they might how about you give me some and i ll sell it to them he lol d you re crazy little dude your brother would kill me he doesn t have to know hmm okay i ll give you a little bit go see if you can sell it he fronted me some reggie not the best but it ll get you high and it s cheaper than regular kush i flipped it for x what it was worth weedman tom was impressed by this point my friends had informed their friends of my entrance into the drug business and i would be getting text messages from unknown numbers quite often every week he would loan me a quarter and i would keep a g for myself to enjoy while flipping the rest keeping a third of the profits i was happy to be able to smoke for free the cash was just an added bonus this endevour continued from my middle school graduation all the way to highschool losing my virginity there was a cute red headed german girl who i would see in the hallways occasionally boy did she have a phat ass impressive for a white girl one day the bus routes were changed and she started riding my bus on the way home i decide to sit next to her and introduce myself at the next stop she quickly blurted i have to pee and ran off the bus to her house chalked it up as a loss and let it go the next day she was the first one on the bus and i was like the th i walked right past her and sat in the back where my friends normally hung out she jumped up and plopped her big behind in the seat next to me and said hey why didn t you come say hi to me again i shrugged your name was aftsov right i m nikki we started chatting on the bus together for about a week until i decided to invite myself over to her house after school okay but we have to hang out on my porch because my parents are home fine by me after walking down the stairs of the bus we strolled to her front porch and sat down where she began telling me her life story which was pretty heavy i did my best to keep things light and humorous to which she replied you don t take anything seriously do you i said what good is life if you can t have fun she laid her back down onto her concrete porch and closed her eyes i don t think i ever met a boy i could talk to like you with that i leaned over her and pressed my lips onto hers my first kiss her lips were slightly chapped but tasted sweet we made out on the bus ride home every day after that and i introduced her to my many friends on the bus weeks after the kiss she told me she wanted to share a secret with me but she couldn t say it out loud nikki pulled out a notebook then jotted down a message for me in pencil i want to have sex with you wow honestly i was happy just having a cute girl to make out with but sex i must have hit the lottery i took her to my house and my parents weren t home they never are i have what s known as a free crib which means my parents work all day and i have the house to myself if my brother wasn t home fortunately he was out with his friends or some shit and i took her on my bed undressed her snow tinted body and went to town on her pink pleasure palace of course i hit it from the back cus i m all about that ass the summer before freshman year of highschool i had a girlfriend to bang friends to hang out with and drugs to sell my lifelong friend had introduced me to lsd which i instantly fell in love with this later led to experiments with mushrooms dmt and ayahuasca most of which i ended up making connections with dealers and started pushing their product for them in exchange for free doses and cash side note i now only enjoy weed lsd and ayahuasca mushrooms and dmt aren t my cup of tea with all my extra money and in an attempt to relive my child soldier days of old i invested in a bunch of airsoft equipment to start playing when my parents asked me where i got the money from i said my childhood life long friend a very rich kid had his dad buy them for me and him so we could play together so i started playing airsoft really learning to enjoy simulated combat sports that is until my brother called me a faggot nerd for playing airsoft he was a paintballer and told me true alpha males play paintball i tried it out and the i realized he wasn t lying the bullets hurt more the enemies were quicker smarter more masculine the equipment was heavier i felt like a real soldier which i really loved i sold most of my airsoft equipment and went all out with paintball gear and started playing with my brother which made my parents happy thanks to short distance sprinting while carrying lb of equipment raised my cardio to insane levels all that running also left me very lean by the time i first stepped into highschool i had a huge drug supply a decent body and a reliable booty call tales of kidd drunkadellic freshman year of highschool i was nervous the first day of highschool but it subsided as i was greeted by old friends in the main lobby i settled into school with ease and after a few weeks had steady clintelle ranging from experimental freshamn to experienced upper classman all hitting me up for some tabs or ganja some of my clients were girls and they were all surprised to find out their dealer was a year old kid i remember a girl made fun of me and said awh you re so cute you think you re a bad boy i replied by saying i dont know about being a bad boy but i am definetely cute she giggled didn t bang her though so i must be a beta anyways near october one of my upper classman friends mentioned he was going into the swim team for his second year and i mentioned i used to love swimming when i was younger he suggested i try out and i did after making the team my cardio and speed caught the eye of both my coach and my teammates i was eventually known as that cool freshman kid the one with the tabs and shit i made a group of close friends one of many i might add that i stayed with throughout highschool sports teams have a way of easily forming bonds between men my reputation preceeded me when i was switched into an ap class out of regular classes i met several people who knew of me they invited me into their group projects where i became aquainted with a junior named bella a beautiful italian girl unfortunately for me she wasn t into me but i didn t hold it against her she was taken aback by my calm response to her rejection and decided she wanted to be my friend i said sure why not once people knew i was hanging out with bella it was like jumping into a lion s den with steaks tied to your waist by my sophmore year people in my grade all knew i hung out with the coolest juniors and seniors this caught the attention of one of my best girlfriends crissy a bright brown skinned carribean beauty she was on the track team and had that banging track star physique muscular legs and a phat round ayss unfortuately her face wasn t the greatest i mean i thought she had a pretty face but atleast her smile was pearly white in addition to her sweet body she was also artistically talented and was a nerd in a cute kind of way she liked anime video games was emo basically my dream girl we ll get back to crissy later on because although i had my heart set on her i was still dating nikki and i had a bigger problem to deal with reputation spreads fast sophmore year my birthday is in the summer and when i turned i hit a great growth spurt i massed up from a short kid to and started to sprout a goatee stuble while i was prospering in terms of physicality and socialitiy one of my good friends was not antione is a short scrawny croatian kid with a thing for photography kids gonna be big some day anyways he was getting bullied relentlessly from a group of jocks since the start of freshman year the ring leader brandon had stolen one of antione s camera when he told me about this i was pissed antione and i were hanging out one day when he gets a text from an unfamiliar number i m gonna kick your ass when i see you it had to be the bastard i told antione to call the number when the voice on the otherside picked up his first words were what do you want faggot i said you re not gonna fight antonie fight me who is this this is aftsov silence i dont care who you are i lll still beat your ass we shit talked for another minute then a date and time was set i m not gonna lie this guy was intimidating he had been lifting since he was or some shit cus he was packing muscle i d estimate he weighd with visible abs he was also a year older than me and a grade higher than me either way i didn t care for one no one fucks with my friends and family two i had an ace up my sleeve my dad was a professional brazilian soccer player he played for the team botafogo and wanted me to follow in his footsteps walking by his trophy collection is always an inspiration although i was good at soccer running like he was the sport just wasn t interesting to me i prefered combat that s when he told me his tales of the rio de jenario slums and how he would get picked on by the older bigger kids he signed up for judo and that was the end of his bullying problem when i was he signed me up for brazilian jiu jitsu and ive been training on and off ever since i m no expert but i ve got some moves the day of the fight rolled around one crisp autumn afternoon darkness was peaking it s head on us we met on the soccer field of the school and a small crowd of people came to watch including my friend antione i knew that bastard would bring his friends so i brought my older brother who was a senior now and he brought his friends from the wrestling team no jumping was happening that night the fight started he swung first and missed after missing he tried to grab me which put his head under my pec i instinctivly put him in a guiottene i tried to pull him into guard but he was too strong to pull him down instead he lifted me up and slammed me thankfully i have good fighting instincts and i rolled my head as forward as i could to avoid getting slammed on my head after the slam he couldnt get back up so i leaned back and wrapped my feet around his back after a few seconds of tight squeeze he started tapping i heard someone say alright aftsov is the man i looked to antione and he said to let him go so i did immediately after letting go he got up and started punching me in the face that fucker clocked me good i grabbed him and pulled him down we rolled around a little and i ended up on his back and he ended up the victim of my rear naked choke needless to say i didn t make the mistake of mercy twice i let him go limp in my chokehold then i kept choking i stood up and he was a log so i slapped him in the face just to say fuck you i walked home with my brother and friends while he regained consciousness people talked about the fight and shared the video which i unfortunately cannot find around and more importantly those guys stopped fucking with antione eventually the video was deleted because brandon died in an accident but i still had that picture saved by now i had quite a few girls striking up conversations bringing up that video one of those girls was crissy i was chilling in our school s breakroom a place for students to hang out after class chill out and play video games she walked in and by coincidence was a friend of my friend they talked to each other while i focused on the game until she sat down on the couch and said hey whatcha playing i said this is halo oh yeah that game is so cool but i m not any good at it double kill t t t triple kill wow you re pretty good actually she said yeah haha our mutual friend said he had to leave and so i expected to be alone in the break room but crissy broke my expecations when she stayed and continued to chat with me we exchanged numbers she brought up the fight i sent her the video and she eventually led the conversation to an erotic fan fiction of us fucking boy did that girl have an imagination crissy and i shared a few sexts until one day she wound up in my room with my cock magically in her mouth we dated for years after our her fellatio initiation becoming a man whore i am a man whore i admit it certified jiggalo i have no loyalty to these hoes and stick my dick into the one with the best body sorry to all the hearts i ve broken i really am i hate seeing a girl cry i was still dating nikki however i feel like an asshole for saying this i had gotten bored of her and already cheated on her with crissy to make things easier on her i told her i wanted to open the relationship she agreed without much conflict enter johanna johanna was a super short and nerdy white girl she read books and shit while she didnt have an ass like nikki s she made up for it with a pretty face we shared science class together and happened to share the lab table oh and did i mention she was nikki s best friend i got her number on a whim and would phone chat with her from time to time one day i popped the big question hey jojo you wanna be like my fuck buddy your fuck buddy really yea but what about nikki she said it s okay oh i mean yeah i would after that phone call i brought a tent to school and kept it stowed in my backpack during class i was feeling up her leg and some people noticed i was putting moves on her eventually kids in the class started commenting about the sexual tension between us i felt a little embarrassed at first but then let it go as i realized screw you guys i m getting laid after school i walked with johanna to the woods behind the campus set up my tent and boned her with pleasure a few days later nikki had found out you fucked jojo how could you i said i wanted to open the relationship baby yeah but you fucked my best friend i m sorry i guess are you still gonna see her yes there was a moment of silence she broke it by saying are you still going to see me i still like you so if you wanna keep dating we can she gently interlaced her fingers with mine and we cuddled the rest of the bus ride home throughout sophomore year i was banging jojo nikki and crissy regularly the former following me around school and causing girls to wonder why the fuck does this guy have chicks following him around everywhere couple that with knowing half the upper classman i had god like social proof and status eventually it paid off as i was invited to my first house party hosted by a senior buddy of mine jason i came over with some weed and rolled us a few blunts one of their parents had bought us some liquor so we started downing shots too the music came on and everybody started dancing one bro who i didnt know started grinding on an asian girl then in a spur of the moment decision a drunk senior girl suddenly shouts come here aftsov you sexy mother fucker and we started making out it was then i decided that i like parties junior year enter the dark days after turning and earning my learners permit i had purchased an old toyota corolla for cash my parents bought it for me as a present but i paid it back to them slowly so they wouldn t know it was drug money i was giving them i was happy to have my car but i still thought about that vodka from jason s party like a light switch my mind snapped on with a simple yet brilliant plan over summer break i hit another growth spurt i was now feet tall with a full goatee i was one of the most mature looking people in my inner friend circle besides the upper classman i decided to use that to my advantage i hopped onto the internet and found a reliable overseas fake id vendor i bought one and tested it out at my local liquor store and the shit actually worked i couldn t believe it actually worked i phoned up the senior i made out with at jason s party and told her we should go drinking together she asked me okay do you know who has alcohol i said i ll just buy some she said how and i said i ll pick you up and show you i scooped her in my corolla which was impressive as she herself was car less then i drove her to liquor store and bought some cheap skol when i dropped it in her lap i felt desire through her eyes i m sure you know what happened next man i was living life this might all sound like a big brag to you but i seriously hope you can take at least one piece of useful advice from this story anyways i was fucking and stacking cash i knew the coke dealers the ecstasy dealers and i took advantage of my vast social network eventually i had the bright idea to buy a bullet proof vest and an assault rifle using my newly made id i contacted a private vendor and arranged a meetup in a random decision i messaged a hot black single in my area and told her to come on the adventure of a lifetime in case you haven t realized already i really love black girls this particular queen gave me her number and i picked her up i bought my first ak which i later sold to my brother as for the hot black single she wound up tied on my bed with her ass sticking out word got around and soon people from the wrong crowd started hitting me up for weapons and shit i called this chapter the dark days because i started getting involved with some sketchy shit and some of my homies caught felonies for that shit shout out to lil brick and finito they kept it real i still send those guys commissary money so they dont starve cus those boys are gonna be gone for a long time anyways when they first got locked up and i sent them those first commissary deposits they quickly told their sister cousin respectively who both attended my school which only boosted my reputation as a good guy who cared for his friends it s also called the dark days because of the drama between my bitches it wasn t all orgies and orgasms crissy and nikki fought all the time playing manipulative mind games with each other to try to get each other to stop seeing me it escalated to the point where nikki thought up a fake rape accusation about me no one believed her of course not even the teachers administration her reckless endangerment of my life is what caused me to ultimately break up with her she started pulling her hair out and got really fat i feel bad for her cus she was nice until she went crazy i m sure crissy was glad that happened lol junior year part ii piano man while skipping class with one of my buddies we decided to try walking into the auditorium i expected it to be unlocked so i decided to jokingly throw myself into the door what ended up happening is i slammed into the door sent it flying open and face planted onto the floor of the now open walk way after dusting my self off and telling my boy to shut the fuck up we both realized the impossible we could sneak into the auditorium we explored the auditorium and made our way up towards the stage where i made a life changing discovery a grand piano sitting right on the stage hidden behind the curtains i was fascinated the white black keys entranced me into playing them after hearing the wonderful noise it produced i was hooked from then on i dedicated myself to learning the piano every lunch i would go to the piano pull up a song on my phone and teach myself how to play once i got good enough i started inviting my bros to come listen they told me it was sick next came the girls i told bella to come take a listen and she was impressed the next time i played she brought her a new friend that girl brought another friend eventually i had a small group of girls to serenade they would take videos of me and show their friends which led to an asian chick named amanda to come and listen to me play coincidentally she knew how to play too she was classically trained since she was typical asians and showed me things i was doing wrong the one tip i never forgot was fixing my hand posture i played with straight fingers when you should really have them curved eventually i banged amanda in the auditorium when it was just her and i there the drama club had their stage props there which included a couch how lucky for me huh straight out of a casting couch scene forreal senior year kidd drunkadellic strikes back i have always been a writer i scored a perfect on my writing sol which was a page essay and had a score of on my writing sat when the time came to take it besides that i ve been fiddling with fictional stories poetry and raps crissy loved listening to me rap and recite poetry to the point where she suggested i start performing and i was glad i fucking did i started off with some kind of oratorical competiton we basically had to give a speech on whatever topic we decided on i was a finalist my name was on the morning announcements for like days straight my english teacher coach was telling everyone about my speech there was nobody who didn t know who i was there was a talent show going on at my school it was called the mister amp misses xyz school name talent competition i deiced i was going to win by spitting some of my bars to the audience there were other competitors a mixture of boys and girls i rapped then minutes later was crowned mister xyz alongside my queen a very hot black girl im like a maganet to them haha unfortuntely i lost the picture of me in my crown so you wont be seeing that one on the bright side being crowned king of my school gave me the confidence to start seeking out other opportunities to perform i eventually got in contact with a moderately sized rap battle league after sending the managers some of my lyrics he invited me to perform i have an offical rap battle record of wins loss at the moment bella watched me peform at that battle and she was eager to show her friends my lyrical carnage this caught the attention of spanish girl and black girls it all came together at prom senior year part ii the story ends but the legend begins by the time prom rolled around i had homies get killed other homies turn rat snake and got heartbroken cheated on by a girl i loved life is bitter sweet i decided when the time came i was gonna let go of all my troubles even if it was just for an hour i drank some vodka with my friend at my crib then had my mom drive us to prom it was populated by the time we arrived and i schmoozed my way around the crowd eventually i came across and arguing couple i knew the guy of the couple an acquiantance named randy one time he was dozing off in class and the teacher yelled at him randy lied and said he was reading to which the teacher said what page are we on i whispered to him and he repeated it out loud the whole classroom burst into laughter because there was only pages haha good times anyways randy didn t want to slow dance with his girlfriend amy i knew the chick and she knew me and i knew for a fact she had a crush on me i took the opportunity to make them both happy and dance with his girl we slow danced she commented on my vodka breathe and i laughed some other girls saw i was dancing with a decently pretty girl and took note here s where the fun starts they start playing some typical upbeat dance shit and i find a hot teacher i always wanted to bone i tell her to dance with me and she keeps shit testing me until i finally say hey if you wanna have fun you gotta dance with me or some shit and she decides oh what the heck i took her by the hand and led her to the center of the dance floor and i started putting rsd moves on her spinning her around lifting her up in the air and finally dipping her by her back so she arched backwards after that one she came up and said oh we shouldn t be doing this aftsov i said why not it s fun and you re pretty tonight and she kissed me on my cheek i heard several people go oooo and she laughed and hustled away in her heels one of my old friends who no longer speaks to me sadly came up to congratulate me i said the fun s not over buddy follow my lead i dont know the name of this dance so if someone has a video of it please link it so i can hyperlink it thanks my buddy and i locked elbows then began skipping on beat in a circle after a few seconds a huge circle formed around us everybody at prom was watching clapping and cheering for us when we unlocked elbows we just busted out into retardly fun freeform dancing after a minute of this a hot black girl one of the ones who was interested in me because of my hip hop accolades ran up and started twerking her phat ayss on me instant boner as the night was coming to a close she brought over her cousin to take a picture with me i ll let you guess which one of them i fucked i didn t win prom king didnt even run for it but i had the time of my life college the winter articles my freshman year in college was almost a repeat of highschool i immediately joined the student council met the right people and started joined a few clubs what i was studying doesnt matter because i dont believe in college being the pathway to success i see school as an opportunity to network and meet people there was a coffee house spoken word poetry recital and i of course performed an original poem i received loud cheers applause and a standing ovation unfortunately my douche bag friend didnt record my accomplishment so i cant show you that one i never forgave him for that two important phrases were spoken to me that night aight aftsov you offically black now bro you could have any girl you want in this room right now i chose a hot girl who ended up being a fashion week runway model we fucked a few times and went our separate ways but i ll always have the bragging rights of having fucked a real life fashion model hahah word got around that i fucked this model chick and my social media was still super strong im talking likes and comments on profile photo updates and i start getting private messages from several different women i found attractive became friends with benefits and became a long term relationship was a white girl asian girl and a black girl more heartache but i have no regrets just memories epilouge closing thoughts well boys i hope you took something out of my self jerk today tonight if i could tell you one thing is find a passion and excel at it like vasily always says be good at something no make it somethings show off your talents also don t be afraid to be a man of your own rules matter of fact fuck the rules you think i d be where i was if i wasn t a crazy fun loving mothafucka i enjoy new experiences i love performing and i love danger but that s just me figure out where you fall in life as a man and be the best you that you can be also my life wasn t all peaches and cream either i had a lot of fuck ups along the way i didn t mention any of the bad times because who want s to read that the world is filled with negative shit so let me share something positive for a change anyways i got my ass kicked i got robbed i was betrayed by friends i got my heart broken i fucked up with countless women who were guaranteed lays but as they say shit life goes on nigga peace young sexy man the breakdown things that make you attractive in highschool and college from my personal experience and observations competing in a sport i had friends on the football team the lacross team and the soccer team every single one of them had at least girl friend if not a fuckbuddy or two as i mentioned i was on the swim team and played paintball on the side being on a highscool sports team is an instant elevation of status winning a fight as i said earlier i was a noivce in mma bjj amp jkd but a few months of training will put you leagues ahead of the average street fighter especially when you re in your teens early s winning that fight my freshman year solidified my reputation as a guy who stands up for his friends and how the young kids put it a whiteboy that got hands doe selling drugs note you can t just be a guy that knows how to get drugs you have to be the guy who sells the drugs to score the bad boy outlaw points with the ladies illegal shit in general let s just say i ve seen the inside of courtrooms but that whole fake id to get alcohol idea of mine made me the first guy invited to any cool kid parties know who throws the parties or throw them yourselves i ve only thrown one party with my buddy in highschool but i ve been invted to dozens and people in my outer social circle would usually ask me when the next party was and if i could invite them have an open crib open crib basically means that you have your whole house to yourself my parents worked from when school ended all the way to like midnight i wouldn t host parties although i had the opportunity to however i did have fun little co ed chill sessions at my house a few times a month which opened the door to meeting friends of friends cute girls who knew cute girls you get the idea young people like hanging out in a house without parents around poking their nose into things it makes them feel more mature double points if it s actually your own place have a driveable car while you might get points with your bros for having an out of commission mustang that you and your pops work on in the garage the ladies only care if you got a car that drives the whip can be anything i got pussy using my corolla be an impressive musician artist i was cursed with shitty drawing skills unlike my friend who was commissoned to paint a mural on the schools lobby wall and was king of art club sexcapades to equalize my curse with a blessing god gave me the talents of piano performance and poetry i call that trio the big ppps i was playing piano after class with friends hanging out i was performing on stage in rap venues and battles and i was receiving standing ovations for my poetry recitals all of those factors contributed to my insane status and drew the attention of the hottest girls in school have a booming social media profile cultivating a cool facebook is easy and while i don t post much on social media anymore i still reap the benefits of huge like comment ratios on my old posts and photos get some of your close friends guys and girls like and comment on eachother s shit and it will grow organically or you can go the dark triad route and create fake profiles kinda like how frank sinatra hired a fake entourage to make people think he was famous fake it until you make it if you have to have multiple friend groups be dynamic with your friendships you dont have to limit yourself to one clique i was friends with jocks with skaters with druggies with dealers with nerds with chior theatre kids with gamers and banging girls from all the cliques knowing the top guys in the clique is an easy in to get the ladies hang around attractive women this one is obvious an unfortunate truth in life is that not every woman will find you attractive it s the way the cookie crumbles for us normal dudes but that s okay i befriend a hot girl who introduced me to other hot girls which led to me being hugged by girls whenever i walked in the halls or into a class with one of them i even had a pair of decently cute girls who would follow me to my classes and purposely go to the bathroom just to sneak over to my classroom and blow kisses at me i fucked both of them of course other girls took notice and word spread aftsov got girlfriends yeah i know they always following him everywhere how can you date girls at the same time aftsov ha those are the you know about having balls i ve encountered many sheepish men and let s just say they weren t spreading wet lips like my friends and i i ve gotten girls literally by just going up to them and saying you re cute wanna be my girlfriend having bros who vouch for you i earned a reputation as a loyal friend and my bros would constantly speak good about me to their friends and girlfriends positive reputation goes a long way joining a cool club or starting your own cool club in college i was a member of the psychology club great place to meet highly empathetic and intelligent young ladies to bone i also started a rap hiphop club and an mma club in addition to those i made friends with the ultimate frizbee dudes and hung out with them sometimes clubs give you ease of access to new male friends and prospective love interests when i first started my rap club i passed out flies and had of my friends show up just to support me it was a great time when dances like prom come around take your friends and control the stage be a social maniac at prom when i arrived at prom after sipping on the vodka i was ready to get my groove on i couldn t dance but i didn t care i just wanted to have a good time i stole a girl from her dude then my friend and i did that cowboy elbow in elbow square dance in a circle thing everyone formed a circle around us and started teaching i used and old rsd jullian club dance routine on a hot teacher then i had a cute little black girl with a phat ayss come and start twerking on me while everybody watched i got laid that night needless to say have an adventerous curious spirit amp be willing to try new things often i would call up friends and go on walks with them and just see where the day would take us the time i ll never forget is where me and friends challanged some random hispanic guys to a game of soccer where my dad s genes in me kicked in and i scored an amazing first goal having fun is a people maganet and remember woman are people too have loving and supportive parents a sad reality of modern life in america is lack of a masculine father figure and an overbearing feminine presence this results in fucked up children i was a fortunate soul who had a father that guided me in the way of men and a mother who let me have my freedom to experiment in life
17142,repost from u needless pickup line why because it needs to be said now read and learn lately i ve been seeing a lot of race talk pop up around here and as usual these discussions have been a fucking shitshow between the stormfront armchair alphas uncle toms and the chronic masturbating facebook creeping fobs it s no fucking surprise that these discussions are useless but never fear lads because your favorite diaper headed goat fucking stone throwing shitskin is here to deliver some culturally diverse wisdom from on high i originally posted this race guide a year ago since then trp has nearly doubled in size and with the influx of race discussion the time is ripe to revisit the topic of how minorities can successfully navigate the sexual marketplace i ve gotten plenty of lays and plenty of rejections and i m gonna share my knowledge with you let s get to it the reality of the situation trp in general does not give a shit about minorities and will largely ignore the dating handicaps specific to minorities the red pill is a reactionary response to the modern liberal social justice movement which loves to blame the vague specters of racism and patriarchy as the source of all minority ills leading to things like affirmative action and tone policing in response trp tends to over correct to the right and minimize racism entirely for example we love to discuss the evil of affirmative action and how the lazy unqualified minorities are stealing jobs and scholarships from honest hard working white men but then ignore the demonstrable fact that resumes with white names get significantly more callbacks humans love to simplify complex issues to black and white heh and the red pill is no exception the reddit demographic is overwhelmingly young white and male and trp reflects that coming to trp for race advice rarely works because you are addressing a population that largely has no understanding of or interest in your experience white guys couldn t give less of a shit if minorities are getting laid it s a lot fucking easier to yell out indianracetroll and enjoy all the sweet minority pussy riding the cc even if they did give a shit they don t know what it s like to actually be a minority and deal with women so all they can do is regurgitate the same vaguely condescending advice hmmm have you tried being more alpha look at all the hero worship u gaylubeoil gets then remember that his advice to asian men was to wait for asian women to hit the wall then eat the superior caucasian jizz out of their used up twats or this superstar whose sage wisdom was to just try being a professional athlete and of course there s the ever popular advice to just casually make a shit ton of money then buy a woman s affection it s not bb without the buck right that s the kind of bullshit advice you re gonna get on trp stop waiting for some magic strategy that will finally unlock the secrets of pussy if you want to get laid you re gonna have to work don t let the echo chamber suck you in yes you would probably do better with women if you were white but you are who you are you cannot change only improve but that is impossible so long as you remain in that woe is me mindset your game will suffer for it and women can smell that shit a mile away why are white men preferred just because you are a minority does not mean you are doomed to be incel just because you are white does not mean you automatically get laid however as members of trp so thoughtfully remind us the western world and modern society was built by white men thanks again guys we really appreciate it therefore the natural result is that society s default perspective is white white men dominate business government and the media women don t prefer white men because they are superior physical specimens they prefer them because white men represent status it s social conditioning ceos are white movie stars are white politicians are white who is brown the garbagemen the dishwashers and the creeps on facebook in popular culture white men represent the standard of attractiveness anything else is deviant and ultimately seen as inferior when you hear the name chad thundercock the man you picture is inevitably white when we say women prefer white men we re not saying that women choose pasty neckbeards over fit and confident minorities we re saying that society conditions us to both view caucasian features as most attractive and caucasian people as higher class if height facial symmetry and physique are controlled women will prefer the white man times and this mentality isn t uniquely western thanks to globalization and a history of colonialism in many foreign countries latin america middle east india asia the most attractive members of society are those with the lightest skin and most european features while the darker and more ethnic looking population is considered undesirable trp constantly shits on women they re children they re immature they re emotional yet somehow women are immune to the pervasive message of white superiority that permeates western society women are incredibly susceptible to external influence and right now that influence is that minorities are inferior indians shit in public asians have small dicks migrants are ruining america even our royalty is fucking insane you re delusional if you think all of this has no effect on a woman s sexual preference either consciously or subconsciously and thanks to in group out group bias you re fucked just because some piece of shit miles away that vaguely resembles you doesn t know how to use a fucking toilet step your game up at first this seems like the same basic advice i criticized earlier but sexual success as a minority depends not only on a high smv but understanding why maximizing your smv is critical to get laid as a minority your sexual game must be ruthless and preemptive your race is already a mark against you in her eyes you can t afford to have any shortcomings because there s a white guy out there who doesn t and your little oneitis is constantly looking to upgrade white boys can get away with being out of shape or dressing poorly or being a little boring not us you need to be lifting dressing sharp perfecting your game grooming yourself and oozing sex appeal this serves two purposes firstly this will determine if your race is actually what s holding you back too many times i see guys on trp mention their bodyfat then wondering if they re not getting laid because of their race it s not the color of your skin it s your manboobs and love handles my fellow nationals love to give me shit for maintaining my physique and say things like middle eastern men aren t supposed to work out then in the same breath complain that our women always go for white and black guys get your fucking house in order before you play the race card secondly because women prefer white men you need to ensure that you are superior in other aspects in order to overcome that preference if girls prefer white guys if things are equal then make sure they re not he s bf you re his clothes are off the rack yours are tailored to fit his jokes are lame while you re demolishing her shit tests hypergamy rules all and it won t matter what race either of you are when you re the clearly superior choice coming out the gate hot and radiating sexual energy will set the tone for the whole interaction and keep you out the beta zone by radiating energy i mean being open and confident with your body not hiding your sexual appetite and perfecting your application of kino the only area where you don t have to be on top of your shit is income and that s only because it ll weed out women looking for an easy bb kill your fetish blonde bimbo blonde bimbo blonde bimbo it s a fucking obsession for some of you you know who you are you guys want to bitch and moan about how girls only want white guys then turn around and lust after white girls with even more restrictive criteria not only is the irony is lost on you but that desperate thirst permeates your entire lives it s incredibly off putting and that s just from reading the pms some of you have sent me i can t even begin to imagine what talking to you in person must be like i m not saying stay in your lane and only fuck girls within your race but you need to really be honest with yourself about why you want some bleach blonde barbie doll with fake titties are you trying to prove something i could understand if it was a desire for white girls in general but for many of you it s this specific outdated stereotype that s no longer relevant you re like a guy lusting after wnba players from it s not enough that you want a white girl she needs to be a rich sorority girl that s just as unrealistic as a white guy who wants an arab girl with a thong under her hijab yeah they exist but they re not fucking with you get rid of your fucking entitlement and be practical with your sexual interest you lost the privilege of being choosy the second you decided to complain about your lack of options avoid stereotypes high smv women are always looking for reasons to disqualify you this is doubly true for minority men they have stereotypes in mind and they re just waiting for you to confirm them you must be vigilant watch your words and actions and defy their expectations for example i m not even muslim but god forbid i ever speak in favor of traditional or old fashioned relationships then i m the backwards patriarchal misogynist who only likes circumcised women no wonder the middle east is a shithole substitute gang rape daughter abortion hood mentality or machismo as needed law think as you like but behave like others is especially vital obviously we have better things to do with our time than debating women but when it comes to discussions about gender roles and relationships white men have much more leeway in what opinions they can voice keep your head down when it comes to controversial topics unless you re in a known comfortable group but also referring to point the higher your smv the less you rock the boat think of the difference between creepy and funny this isn t limited to conversations but to all potential situations where you might be judged if you re indian don t try chatting up girls on your way back from the gym or after a fragrant meal if you re black make sure you re well read and informed on current events if you re asian and a grower rethink those boxer swim shorts when you hit the beach you know the stereotypes don t give them weapons to use against you avoid conflict this is related to but is so important it needs to be addressed on its own when you as a minority go for a girl of a different race people will give you shit mainly guys who feel they are above you on the hierarchy of race white gt black hispanic gt arab asian sure you two might have shared a beer minutes earlier but now they see your girl they like your girl and they want your girl in their minds they can convince her to ditch you and upgrade and they re not wrong if you lose frame that s exactly what she ll do if you get jealous mate guard lash out or talk back you play right into their hand especially if it s a white guy banking on you being an angry minority obviously you have more leeway for an ltr but not total immunity a cool head must always prevail amused mastery is your friend it s i thought racism was dead ideally your opponent will seem backwards and insecure instead of you the more subtle and insidious threat will be the people who try to shame you for not going after the girls of your own race fuck them they re either jealous guys or girls of your own race who want a soft bb landing when they fly off the carousel black women especially are pros at this and all the steve harvey think like a man bullshit from recent years has made it worse watch them change their tune when they actually get some white attention but even white girls get in on the action trying to shame white guys into staying away from asian girls don t engage them or try to debate them i always say that i ll start dating middle eastern girls when they do the same but even that i feel is too much embrace your culture one tactic i ve seen for minorities is to bury their ethnicity whitewash themselves and try to blend in as much as possible that is the equivalent of ab implants on the small chance they re not immediately ridiculed they don t hold up to any kind of close inspection a minority who tries to ignore his looks or heritage performs a similar act of insecurity we are not white and never will be don t pretend otherwise women love pride and confidence and trust me there s nothing better than boldly saying i am x with that strong sense of culture and history especially when the random white guy next to you thinks his grandma was german maybe before trailing off mumbling something about th cherokee exception the only people who can pull this off are minority guys who are half white often times they have to pick a side stay true to your roots but play up the white aspects if you re trying to get girls white girls will like you because you re exotic and different enough to be interesting but still white enough to not be alienating minority girls will like you because you allow them to satisfy their white hypergamy but you re still ethnic enough to not make them feel like they re selling out this is counterpoint to don t be the foreigner but know your history culture and where you came from and don t be shy if an appropriate opportunity comes up for you to discuss it this leads into the next point embrace your heritage but give them what they want white girls love war bonnets dream catchers moccasins and those vaguely tribal designs they find on clothing at vintage stores but how many of them care to learn about native american history or god forbid actually visit the rez they love all the flashy accoutrement of foreign cultures especially the food but care very little for cultural significance or respectful admiration to them appreciating another culture means appropriation and accessorizing think of how much women love travel and compare that to what they actually do while abroad spoiler it s the same fucking shit they do at home just with a foreign filter and a smug sense of false worldliness when pursuing western women you need to give them a similar experience i am north african when i m with girls and culture comes up all they care about are khamsas mint tea hookah and belly dancing that s what appeals to them and even then you can see their eyes glaze over and their hands twitch for their phones if i mention the history and significance of those things they want superficial enjoyment without any deeper understanding don t try to educate them just sweep them up in the ride i can take them to any shitty ahwa arabic caf and they act like it s something out of arabian nights figure out the equivalent for your race ethnicity and learn how to present it and make damn well sure you know the best place in town for insert race here food with shining eyes they will look at you and profess how wonderful it is that you thought they were special enough to introduce to your culture try not to roll your eyes the question remains as to when to bust out these cultural big guns honestly if you re at the point where you can take a girl to a bhangra show tea ceremony or cultural art exhibit then you re pretty much already in in fact some of these things might be too intense for a first meetup rather you want to dole out ethnic theatrics gradually unless culture was explicitly discussed and she expressed interest you want the first date or two to be normal rp feel free to tease her about how awesome your culture is and that you might bring her around if she s cool enough don t dump it on her allow her to explore then throughout the relationship you can periodically include her in the ethnic activities the point is to not make it a gimmick but another tool in your arsenal again keep point in mind don t lay it on too thick or you ll be typecast we are more than our ethnicity all of us respect yourself as an individual we defy stereotypes and racism because we refuse to allow others to define us solely by our race don t do the same to yourself know your demographic this point seems antithetical to the rest of the guide but the truth is that you are going to do better with certain women and certain scenarios versus others it s the concept of diminishing returns yes you can and should go for any women you want wherever you want but if you want the biggest bang for your buck pun intended you ll know how to strategize a location for example unless you are extraordinarily fit or good looking top tinder or online dating is not your best bet whereas the top or so of white men can compete online only the top asian and indian and latino and black can do the same online dating massively enables a woman s hypergamy and there s no point in her settling for you when a better option is a few swipes away i had a white roommate who is shorter chubbier and less attractive than myself but he matched with girls on tinder far more often than i did whether he actually closed is another thing entirely however if we walked into a party together he would be invisible in real life my confidence and swagger shine through in a way that isn t possible on a phone screen while he was matching with girls every week i was consistently picking up girls on the weekends it s all about context similarly for a minority a cold daygame approach is an uphill battle yeah we ve all seen the videos where the asian pua gets phone numbers but how often do you think those girls text back in my experience it s not worth the time and effort unless you can establish some connection ie not just talking to her on some random sidewalk your best bets are parties and social events through your circle of friends and clubs and group activities basically any situation where you re not judged solely on your looks if you re lifting and taking care of your appearance girls will find you attractive but these are situations where you can use your game confidence presence and force of personality to overcome any hesitation a girl may have for your race you know where i see asian guys with white girls i see them at house parties hiking trails and art museums i don t see them at nightclubs or frat parties learn to work the venue unsurprisingly concerts and music festivals are also great place to find receptive girls once you bust out some sweet moves that girl rolling won t give a fuck what color you are b geography not all areas are the same for picking up women obviously you should never uproot your life solely for women but if you have the choice of locale or you re visiting then bear this in mind essentially geography can be broken down into three areas climate competition and scarcity climate not the weather but the vibe of the city and what the ideal is if you re in santa barbara or another beach town and girls are running after blonde surfer beach boys then you re gonna have a bad time likewise if you re in the deep south and there s lingering racial tension compare those locations to a place like south florida proximity to the caribbean and multicultural demographics make it much friendlier for minorities competition who are you running up against in a world class city like new york you re competing with the cream of the crop lawyers brokers old money male models etc trp advocates becoming one of those world class men but until you do so you re playing out of your league compare that to the pacific northwest seattle and portland crawling with politically correct sjw bp beta guys frame and game will take you far scarcity where the white women at if you want a white girl then find out where they are attractive white women are rare in san francisco and on top of that there are plenty of asian and indian guys to go around their value becomes hugely inflated compare that to the midwest where pretty white girls are a dime a dozen c race and culture the other factors to take into account are the race and culture of the girl you pursue after a certain amount of time you will find out which girls are the most receptive to you and act accordingly for myself if i put in the base amount of effort i can close an attractive latina or mixed girl a decent white girl and a below average asian so i tend to go for hispanic black mixed race women avoid asian women entirely and handle white women on a case by case basis therefore the overall quality of the women i date and my rate of success are significantly higher than if i approached all women equally the farther away you are from a woman s racial ideal the more she will shit test you in her mind you have to compensate for your race by being especially alpha by culture i mean the social situation and preference of the girl you pursue this also depends on where you are meeting women for example white men dominate hollywood government and business the closer women are to those spheres the more they are going to pursue and value white men likewise look at black men in athletics music and entertainment the same applies different scenes will have different standards a country girl might exclusively date white guys while a girl who actually lived on a farm will be open to minorities distinctions are paramount girls who overly value image will take significantly more work d breaking it down by race what has been true in my experience if you don t know where to look start here obviously not including girls of your own race black white girls blasting childish gambino and drake hip asian girls on dance teams and any middle eastern girl who isn t too religious seriously kim kardashian isn t doing anything new arab girls love black guys anything to piss off baba indian asian girls are receptive and hispanic girls are down for the brown same color different flavor middle eastern just like indian guys hispanic girls are fair game if you tend towards the white side lebanese armenian persian etc then white girls are a viable option as long as you keep that smv high if you tend towards the black side moroccan egyptian etc then black and mixed girls are gonna be all over you hispanic keeping up that cultural exchange middle eastern girls are great especially if you re a good dancer and like arab guys if you re whiter argentinian from jalisco etc you can go after white girls and if you re blacker puerto rican dominican etc go after the black and mixed girls asian nerdy white girls that read too much manga are usually down along with black girls as they represent the other low smv race for women and will welcome the attention besides that the easy way is to get really good at something then plow through girls in that area the asian guys i know that get hot including white girls are creative types singer dancer artist etc or talented athletes that are great at what they do if you ve been working on your smv any girl is worth a shot don t let this point dissuade you just be aware of the context within which you pursue any girl and decide if you re making progress evaluating your interaction is a dynamic process the key here is to not put the pussy on a pedestal sometimes for guys the idea of fucking the blonde sorority girl is more appealing than the actual act the blackpeopletwitter effect you ever check out the blackpeopletwitter subreddit it s filled with memes and jokes from the perspective of black popular culture but whenever there s a post critical of white people or poking fun at them you can guarantee the comments section blows up with slighted whites eager to defend themselves use that insecurity to your advantage this is the biggest piece of actual strategy that wasn t included in the original post turn the tables and tap into white guilt and fear of exclusion to neg girls and amog guys be ruthless with white stereotypes they re lame they re weird they age like shit they can t dance their food is bland white people put cucumber slices in water to make it less spicy call her out on her ugg boots and starbucks give that frat star shit about his sperrys and button down white people are dumb rednecks boring and basic suburbians or out of touch percenters they can t win if they try to get racial back then you use the liberal machine to your advantage and make them look like the bad guys when these white guys get pissy just call them autistic and throw out a line about them shooting the place up once you ve dominated them socially and physically just wait for the girls war bride mentality to kick in and scoop them up the trick here is to be subtle with these comments aggressively opening with reverse racism is just going to exclude you more wait for an opening to present itself and then strike anyone who s spent any amount of time with white people can tell you those opportunities arise quickly and abundantly a hard stare down and an eye roll will move mountains never date a race traitor we all know these girls asian and indian girls are the worst offenders they are a liberal and educated veneer over a damaged self hating core race traitors are not simply girls who date outside their race rather they constantly talk shit about the men of their race and systemically ignore them romantically as they ride the carousel hard until the wall hits and they re forced to come crawling back to their culture and carve out a cushy life for themselves with a bb husband and a dead bedroom throw in the secret orgy sex tape that hubby finds and the reddit relationships post writes itself the hypocrisy is astounding they talk about how men of their race are creepy losers not realizing they re shitting on their own brothers and fathers next time you hear an indian girl talk about how indian men are pussies ask her if her sons are gonna be half or full blooded pussy and watch her head explode trp does not advocate anger against women but if anyone deserves it it s these women this might seem like a small point compared to the rest but the massive hypergamy of race traitors further skews the smp necessitating this guide they re usually smart enough to at least not be single mothers by the time the wall hits but they will always find their bb if you keep working on your smv and dating women eventually these girls will come around you re the perfect package the af they crave so much wrapped in a socially acceptable same race package they get to ride the carousel with no stigma they re happy their parents are happy everyone wins except you do not fall for their trap they will work hard to rope you in and pretend they are the perfect package even if you ignore the whore past the facade will inevitably crumble do not date them do not marry them they are only good for the pump and dump on the plus side if you show up with a white girl on your arm these minority girls will be the easiest fucking lays of your life and will pull the most sexually depraved shit to prove to you and themselves that her pussy is just as good as stacey s tl dr if there are salty white boys in the comments then you know this post is legit

just waiting for you to confirm them you must be vigilant watch your words and actions and defy their expectations for example i m not even muslim but god forbid i ever speak in favor of traditional or old fashioned relationships then i m the backwards patriarchal misogynist who only likes circumcised women no wonder the middle east is a shithole substitute gang rape daughter abortion hood mentality or machismo as needed law think as you like but behave like others is especially vital obviously we have better things to do with our time than debating women but when it comes to discussions about gender roles and relationships white men have much more leeway in what opinions they can voice keep your head down when it comes to controversial topics unless you re in a known comfortable group but also referring to point the higher your smv the less you rock the boat think of the difference between creepy and funny this isn t limited to conversations but to all potential situations where you might be judged if you re indian don t try chatting up girls on your way back from the gym or after a fragrant meal if you re black make sure you re well read and informed on current events if you re asian and a grower rethink those boxer swim shorts when you hit the beach you know the stereotypes don t give them weapons to use against you avoid conflict this is related to but is so important it needs to be addressed on its own when you as a minority go for a girl of a different race people will give you shit mainly guys who feel they are above you on the hierarchy of race white gt black hispanic gt arab asian sure you two might have shared a beer minutes earlier but now they see your girl they like your girl and they want your girl in their minds they can convince her to ditch you and upgrade and they re not wrong if you lose frame that s exactly what she ll do if you get jealous mate guard lash out or talk back you play right into their hand especially if it s a white guy banking on you being an angry minority obviously you have more leeway for an ltr but not total immunity a cool head must always prevail amused mastery is your friend it s i thought racism was dead ideally your opponent will seem backwards and insecure instead of you the more subtle and insidious threat will be the people who try to shame you for not going after the girls of your own race fuck them they re either jealous guys or girls of your own race who want a soft bb landing when they fly off the carousel black women especially are pros at this and all the steve harvey think like a man bullshit from recent years has made it worse watch them change their tune when they actually get some white attention but even white girls get in on the action trying to shame white guys into staying away from asian girls don t engage them or try to debate them i always say that i ll start dating middle eastern girls when they do the same but even that i feel is too much embrace your culture one tactic i ve seen for minorities is to bury their ethnicity whitewash themselves and try to blend in as much as possible that is the equivalent of ab implants on the small chance they re not immediately ridiculed they don t hold up to any kind of close inspection a minority who tries to ignore his looks or heritage performs a similar act of insecurity we are not white and never will be don t pretend otherwise women love pride and confidence and trust me there s nothing better than boldly saying i am x with that strong sense of culture and history especially when the random white guy next to you thinks his grandma was german maybe before trailing off mumbling something about th cherokee exception the only people who can pull this off are minority guys who are half white often times they have to pick a side stay true to your roots but play up the white aspects if you re trying to get girls white girls will like you because you re exotic and different enough to be interesting but still white enough to not be alienating minority girls will like you because you allow them to satisfy their white hypergamy but you re still ethnic enough to not make them feel like they re selling out this is counterpoint to don t be the foreigner but know your history culture and where you came from and don t be shy if an appropriate opportunity comes up for you to discuss it this leads into the next point embrace your heritage but give them what they want white girls love war bonnets dream catchers moccasins and those vaguely tribal designs they find on clothing at vintage stores but how many of them care to learn about native american history or god forbid actually visit the rez they love all the flashy accoutrement of foreign cultures especially the food but care very little for cultural significance or respectful admiration to them appreciating another culture means appropriation and accessorizing think of how much women love travel and compare that to what they actually do while abroad spoiler it s the same fucking shit they do at home just with a foreign filter and a smug sense of false worldliness when pursuing western women you need to give them a similar experience i am north african when i m with girls and culture comes up all they care about are khamsas mint tea hookah and belly dancing that s what appeals to them and even then you can see their eyes glaze over and their hands twitch for their phones if i mention the history and significance of those things they want superficial enjoyment without any deeper understanding don t try to educate them just sweep them up in the ride i can take them to any shitty ahwa arabic caf and they act like it s something out of arabian nights figure out the equivalent for your race ethnicity and learn how to present it and make damn well sure you know the best place in town for insert race here food with shining eyes they will look at you and profess how wonderful it is that you thought they were special enough to introduce to your culture try not to roll your eyes the question remains as to when to bust out these cultural big guns honestly if you re at the point where you can take a girl to a bhangra show tea ceremony or cultural art exhibit then you re pretty much already in in fact some of these things might be too intense for a first meetup rather you want to dole out ethnic theatrics gradually unless culture was explicitly discussed and she expressed interest you want the first date or two to be normal rp feel free to tease her about how awesome your culture is and that you might bring her around if she s cool enough don t dump it on her allow her to explore then throughout the relationship you can periodically include her in the ethnic activities the point is to not make it a gimmick but another tool in your arsenal again keep point in mind don t lay it on too thick or you ll be typecast we are more than our ethnicity all of us respect yourself as an individual we defy stereotypes and racism because we refuse to allow others to define us solely by our race don t do the same to yourself know your demographic this point seems antithetical to the rest of the guide but the truth is that you are going to do better with certain women and certain scenarios versus others it s the concept of diminishing returns yes you can and should go for any women you want wherever you want but if you want the biggest bang for your buck pun intended you ll know how to strategize a location for example unless you are extraordinarily fit or good looking top tinder or online dating is not your best bet whereas the top or so of white men can compete online only the top asian and indian and latino and black can do the same online dating massively enables a woman s hypergamy and there s no point in her settling for you when a better option is a few swipes away i had a white roommate who is shorter chubbier and less attractive than myself but he matched with girls on tinder far more often than i did whether he actually closed is another thing entirely however if we walked into a party together he would be invisible in real life my confidence and swagger shine through in a way that isn t possible on a phone screen while he was matching with girls every week i was consistently picking up girls on the weekends it s all about context similarly for a minority a cold daygame approach is an uphill battle yeah we ve all seen the videos where the asian pua gets phone numbers but how often do you think those girls text back in my experience it s not worth the time and effort unless you can establish some connection ie not just talking to her on some random sidewalk your best bets are parties and social events through your circle of friends and clubs and group activities basically any situation where you re not judged solely on your looks if you re lifting and taking care of your appearance girls will find you attractive but these are situations where you can use your game confidence presence and force of personality to overcome any hesitation a girl may have for your race you know where i see asian guys with white girls i see them at house parties hiking trails and art museums i don t see them at nightclubs or frat parties learn to work the venue unsurprisingly concerts and music festivals are also great place to find receptive girls once you bust out some sweet moves that girl rolling won t give a fuck what color you are b geography not all areas are the same for picking up women obviously you should never uproot your life solely for women but if you have the choice of locale or you re visiting then bear this in mind essentially geography can be broken down into three areas climate competition and scarcity climate not the weather but the vibe of the city and what the ideal is if you re in santa barbara or another beach town and girls are running after blonde surfer beach boys then you re gonna have a bad time likewise if you re in the deep south and there s lingering racial tension compare those locations to a place like south florida proximity to the caribbean and multicultural demographics make it much friendlier for minorities competition who are you running up against in a world class city like new york you re competing with the cream of the crop lawyers brokers old money male models etc trp advocates becoming one of those world class men but until you do so you re playing out of your league compare that to the pacific northwest seattle and portland crawling with politically correct sjw bp beta guys frame and game will take you far scarcity where the white women at if you want a white girl then find out where they are attractive white women are rare in san francisco and on top of that there are plenty of asian and indian guys to go around their value becomes hugely inflated compare that to the midwest where pretty white girls are a dime a dozen c race and culture the other factors to take into account are the race and culture of the girl you pursue after a certain amount of time you will find out which girls are the most receptive to you and act accordingly for myself if i put in the base amount of effort i can close an attractive latina or mixed girl a decent white girl and a below average asian so i tend to go for hispanic black mixed race women avoid asian women entirely and handle white women on a case by case basis therefore the overall quality of the women i date and my rate of success are significantly higher than if i approached all women equally the farther away you are from a woman s racial ideal the more she will shit test you in her mind you have to compensate for your race by being especially alpha by culture i mean the social situation and preference of the girl you pursue this also depends on where you are meeting women for example white men dominate hollywood government and business the closer women are to those spheres the more they are going to pursue and value white men likewise look at black men in athletics music and entertainment the same applies different scenes will have different standards a country girl might exclusively date white guys while a girl who actually lived on a farm will be open to minorities distinctions are paramount girls who overly value image will take significantly more work d breaking it down by race what has been true in my experience if you don t know where to look start here obviously not including girls of your own race black white girls blasting childish gambino and drake hip asian girls on dance teams and any middle eastern girl who isn t too religious seriously kim kardashian isn t doing anything new arab girls love black guys anything to piss off baba indian asian girls are receptive and hispanic girls are down for the brown same color different flavor middle eastern just like indian guys hispanic girls are fair game if you tend towards the white side lebanese armenian persian etc then white girls are a viable option as long as you keep that smv high if you tend towards the black side moroccan egyptian etc then black and mixed girls are gonna be all over you hispanic keeping up that cultural exchange middle eastern girls are great especially if you re a good dancer and like arab guys if you re whiter argentinian from jalisco etc you can go after white girls and if you re blacker puerto rican dominican etc go after the black and mixed girls asian nerdy white girls that read too much manga are usually down along with black girls as they represent the other low smv race for women and will welcome the attention besides that the easy way is to get really good at something then plow through girls in that area the asian guys i know that get hot including white girls are creative types singer dancer artist etc or talented athletes that are great at what they do if you ve been working on your smv any girl is worth a shot don t let this point dissuade you just be aware of the context within which you pursue any girl and decide if you re making progress evaluating your interaction is a dynamic process the key here is to not put the pussy on a pedestal sometimes for guys the idea of fucking the blonde sorority girl is more appealing than the actual act the blackpeopletwitter effect you ever check out the blackpeopletwitter subreddit it s filled with memes and jokes from the perspective of black popular culture but whenever there s a post critical of white people or poking fun at them you can guarantee the comments section blows up with slighted whites eager to defend themselves use that insecurity to your advantage this is the biggest piece of actual strategy that wasn t included in the original post turn the tables and tap into white guilt and fear of exclusion to neg girls and amog guys be ruthless with white stereotypes they re lame they re weird they age like shit they can t dance their food is bland white people put cucumber slices in water to make it less spicy call her out on her ugg boots and starbucks give that frat star shit about his sperrys and button down white people are dumb rednecks boring and basic suburbians or out of touch percenters they can t win if they try to get racial back then you use the liberal machine to your advantage and make them look like the bad guys when these white guys get pissy just call them autistic and throw out a line about them shooting the place up once you ve dominated them socially and physically just wait for the girls war bride mentality to kick in and scoop them up the trick here is to be subtle with these comments aggressively opening with reverse racism is just going to exclude you more wait for an opening to present itself and then strike anyone who s spent any amount of time with white people can tell you those opportunities arise quickly and abundantly a hard stare down and an eye roll will move mountains never date a race traitor we all know these girls asian and indian girls are the worst offenders they are a liberal and educated veneer over a damaged self hating core race traitors are not simply girls who date outside their race rather they constantly talk shit about the men of their race and systemically ignore them romantically as they ride the carousel hard until the wall hits and they re forced to come crawling back to their culture and carve out a cushy life for themselves with a bb husband and a dead bedroom throw in the secret orgy sex tape that hubby finds and the reddit relationships post writes itself the hypocrisy is astounding they talk about how men of their race are creepy losers not realizing they re shitting on their own brothers and fathers next time you hear an indian girl talk about how indian men are pussies ask her if her sons are gonna be half or full blooded pussy and watch her head explode trp does not advocate anger against women but if anyone deserves it it s these women this might seem like a small point compared to the rest but the massive hypergamy of race traitors further skews the smp necessitating this guide they re usually smart enough to at least not be single mothers by the time the wall hits but they will always find their bb if you keep working on your smv and dating women eventually these girls will come around you re the perfect package the af they crave so much wrapped in a socially acceptable same race package they get to ride the carousel with no stigma they re happy their parents are happy everyone wins except you do not fall for their trap they will work hard to rope you in and pretend they are the perfect package even if you ignore the whore past the facade will inevitably crumble do not date them do not marry them they are only good for the pump and dump on the plus side if you show up with a white girl on your arm these minority girls will be the easiest fucking lays of your life and will pull the most sexually depraved shit to prove to you and themselves that her pussy is just as good as stacey s tl dr if there are salty white boys in the comments then you know this post is legit
17191,introduction most men fail with women for one of two reasons they are afraid of coming off as creepy or needy so they don t push the gas hard enough or they are actually creepy or needy so they push the gas too hard this article is about striking the right balance between being aggressive and not overly aggressive my goal with this article is to teach you what creepiness is so you can stop worrying about it and be more confident once you know what creepiness is you can be more open to expressing yourself to women not less creepiness neediness desperation selfishness and beta behavior are all symptoms of the same thing emotional overinvestment emotional overinvestment when you focus too much of your thoughts on emotions on a thing or person which causes you to want it too much it is ok to want to eat a sandwich for lunch but it is creepy to think about the sandwich all day to the exclusion of everything else it is ok to love your mother but it is creepy to spend hours every day talking on the phone with her girls want to be wanted but not too much people emotionally overinvest for many reasons with a major reason being scarcity scarcity is the feeling that we want or need something and we have no easy way of getting that thing so whenever we have a chance to get that thing we must focus all of our attention on getting it everybody needs to eat but most people in developed countries don t obsess about their next meal because they know they can get food whenever they want but if you were starving and had no food you would spend all day thinking about food and you would stop at nothing if you thought there was a possibility of getting a sandwich scarcity in turn is caused by a shitty self image we feel scarcity with respect to a certain thing because we subconsciously feel we are not good enough to get that thing when the cashier at mcdonald s smiles at us we emotionally invest in her because we feel like no other woman will want to have sex with us surprisingly scarcity has nothing to do with how many women you have or can get lots of attractive guys and even celebrities can get tons of pussy but still feel scarcity and act creepy a guy can also have nothing and still feel abundance scarcity is a mindset the difference between what you think you can get and what you think you need by adjusting those variables you can eliminate that mindset some of you may be thinking this shit article does not apply to be me because i am not creepy or needy bruh you are probably a creep all men have a natural tendency to emotionally overinvest in women and even a little too much emotional overinvest will cause women to run for the hills you don t need to be hiding in her bushes with binoculars for her to feel uneasy if you act just a little too emotionally overinvested in a woman her subconscious mind will register you as a creep even if your actions are outwardly socially acceptable women have evolved a very sensitive ability to sense of what men are emotionally invested in and if they can sense that men are emotionally overinvested in them they feel a strong aversion even if they would otherwise be attracted to the man because humans evolved to sense creepiness there are objective criteria to what is and is not creepy and if you learn this criteria you can stop being creepy and not have to worry about whether you are being creepy even if you don t believe my theory you need objective criteria to guide your actions because you absolutely cannot base your behavior on what women do and do not judge to be creepy women often have bizarre or stupid criteria for determining creepiness they misjudge situations all the time and they sometimes make false accusations of creepiness out of pure spite more importantly you cannot read womens minds so you have no idea what they will think is creepy the alpha male quid pro quo the key to controlling your emotional investment in women is this you must only do things for women after they have done something for you and only in proportion to what they have done for you she should do something for you you should then reciprocate she should then do something bigger for you you should reciprocate on a slightly bigger level and so forth by doing things i mean anything buying her things doing favors for her or even giving her attention or looking at her i call this rule the alpha male quid pro quo and i think it is the single most important rule when interacting with women the alpha male quid pro quo applies in every situation with every woman no matter how hot or important she is and throughout the whole relationship no matter how long you have known her it applies in real life over text in dating apps and across every category of your relationship in addition it only applies to objectively meaningful things she has done for you actions mean more than words if she has promised she will do a bunch of things for you or gave you a bunch of sweet compliments or texted you a bunch she still has done very little for you from an objective standpoint just because you are thrilled to have a pretty girl text you does not mean she deserves a text back she needs to do something to deserve it first humans evolved to view relationships as reciprocal exchanges so if somebody proves themselves to be a fair and valuable trading partner we feel a deep emotional connection to them not only do we value the fruits of the exchange but we also view the trading partner s life as an extension to our own such and vicariously feel their joys and victories because we are helping them win and they are helping us win our subconscious mind keeps a tally of everything we have done for them and everything they have done for us which is why we feel angry and betrayed when we do something for a person and they do not reciprocate but here is the strange thing we also feel disgusted and repelled by people who do too much stuff for us we do not deserve when people do things we have done nothing to deserve we subconsciously feel we have incurred a debt we must repay our subconscious mind knows nobody does anything for free and somehow knows that the doer wants and expects something back the feeling that somebody is fixated on you because they want and expect something from you is unpleasant and we seek to escape that pressure by escaping from the person this is why women often lose attraction if you ask them for things beg express disappointment when they say no and give her stuff for nothing in return their lizard mind senses that have emotionally invested in her and want something and will stop at nothing to get it and the truth is her lizard mind is right no matter how much you consciously say to yourself i am just a nice generous guy your subconscious mind wants something from her and you will get mad if you do not get it because of our subconscious propensity to view relationships as reciprocal trading exchanges we emotionally invest in people after we do things for them person a may think person b is attractive but person a won t really emotionally care about person b until person a does things for person b when i was in college my guidance counselor suggested i apply to yale law school i laughed i knew my grades were not good enough but i applied anyway just to see what would happen before i applied to yale i had not cared about getting in but the act of applying made me emotionally invest in yale so i got very upset after i got rejected the same thing happens with women even if the woman shows you no interest at all by doing things for her even just texting her you emotionally invest in her such that you get angry when she does not text back most guys of course assume the opposite they think if they do things for a woman first she will like them more but for the reasons i described earlier doing undeserved favors actually repels women the strange thing is that women may ask for these favors and even think with their rational mind they want them but when you actually do these favors their subconscious starts to produce a bad feeling about you but she will eventually leave if the bad feeling grows large enough whenever you are feeling emotional irrational insecure or anxious around a woman take a second to rationally analyze the interaction as a reciprocal exchange are you doing more for her than she is doing for you are you texting her more than she is texting you are you staring at her when she is not doing anything to merit being stared at are you waiting for her or doing favors for her when she has not done the same for you are you divulging deep secrets about your life when she is not doing the same because men naturally tend to emotionally overinvest in women you should constantly be adjusting your behavior and attention to ensure that the interaction is a reciprocal exchange women deeply want to form an emotional connection with the alpha male vicariously experience his awesome life and gain access to his protection and resources in other words they want acceptance into his life the alpha male grants this acceptance by paying the woman attention women subconsciously know that a man s attention is proportional to his emotional investment and a man s emotional investment in a woman is proportional to his acceptance of her but again if a man emotionally overinvests in a woman she will not want his acceptance because she will have incurred a debt she must repay later women feel more comfortable in relationships where the man has not deeply emotionally invested in them if you do things for a woman only after she does things for you you let her control the amount of attention she gets if she wants attention she can do things for you if she does not want attention she can turn it off by not doing things this by the way is how you get women to chase you by only rewarding her post hoc she can further the relationship on her own terms but if you do stuff for her first you are emotionally investing in her and pressuring her into reciprocating and nobody likes to be pressured it sounds strange but part of the reason women sometimes like men who ignore them is because those men are not pressuring them the woman can jump in and out of the relationship whenever they please because the man does not give a fuck whether she is there or not of course at some point you may want to enter into a long term relationship with a woman who consistently contributes but to do so you must find a woman who wants to consistently contribute and will always be more emotionally invested than you women have a very keen sense of their own value and a subconscious attention sensor which tells them why they are receiving attention the moment the attention sensor senses that you are doing things for she has not worked for it throws up a red flag and she starts looking for the exits womens attention sensor is extremely sensitive and largely irrational if you are a successful attractive guy with a fun life it will not actually hurt you to bestow upon a random woman a free drink or a few minutes of attention but to her subconscious lizard mind even that little bit of undeserved attention indicates disproportionate emotional investment this is why even a little bit of extra attention creeps women out why creepiness sucks emotional overinvestment is unattractive for a variety of reasons a few of which i describe here first when you emotionally overinvest in a woman you usually subconsciously know something is wrong so you start to censor yourself and act strangely it is almost like your subconscious mind knows you are being creepy so it tries to hide your real emotions and stop you from what you are doing this is why creepy people are often anxious and are somehow off their subconscious mind is trying to stop them from expressing their creepiness but it is extremely difficult to hide your real emotions so women can tell something is off because your words and actions are not congruent with your emotional state humans have a deep aversion to people who are non congruent like this because we can sense they have some ulterior motive against us because they do a confident non creepy man is congruent his actions thoughts and emotions align and he feels no guilt shame or anxiety in a how he feels because he is not worried he is doing anything wrong in a weird way he is like an open book when he says or does something you do not need to worry he is lying or has some ulterior motive but to be congruent you must first feel free to express yourself and creeps do not feel free to express themselves because on some weird level they know their emotional state is wrong second emotional overinvestment just feels bad if you ve ever been obsessed with a girl or heartbroken over a breakup you know that feeling sucks you feel weak inferior dependent anxious and sometimes even depressed lonely or angry instead of focusing on your life s mission and the things you that bring you happiness you are focusing on a person who may or may not give a shit about you an advantage of the alpha male quid pro quo is that your own emotions will tell you if you are doing it right if your actions make you feel clear headed alpha and strong you are doing it right if your actions are making you feel weak beta and anxious you are doing it wrong if you text a girl and afterwards and move on to do the next thing you are doing it right if you text a girl and afterwards feel anxious and keep thinking about her like you may have done something wrong you are doing it wrong third emotional overinvestment oftentimes becomes a vicious spiral we emotionally overinvest in a girl so we do things for she does not deserve which causes us to feel even more emotionally invested which causes us to do even more for her etc and the more we become emotionally invested the less attracted she becomes so the less she does for us which causes in turn to do more to get her back this vicious spiral is why some guys end up in jail for stalking the mcdonald s cashier when all she ever did was smile at them we have all felt ourselves slipping into this vicious spiral at some point in our lives which is why we become so horrified when see it in somebody else especially when that person has emotionally overinvested in us because creepy people feel scarcity they feel desperation and extreme desperation is scary because it means you might do something crazy or violent to get the thing you want if you knew a homeless man was starving and has not eaten in over two weeks you would not walk by him with a sandwich because you would know he might do something crazy to get the sandwich from you not only would your rational brain logically know that he might become violent over the sandwich but your emotions would also feel uneasy around him because we all subconsciously know how it feels to be desperate and we can sense it in others for the same reason women do not like to be around creepy guys because they know those creepy guys might become annoying stalkerish or even violent if a man acts even a tiny bit creepy women can sense it and are repelled because their primitive lizard mind knows that that tiny bit of creepiness can blossom into something seriously creepy later i have noticed that needy insecure and codependent people are more likely to be disgusted by people who emotionally overinvest in them than average people i suspect this is because needy people are themselves more likely to fall into this vicious spiral of neediness so seeing even a little neediness in others makes them assume the other person will fall into this vicious spiral as well i suspect this is why women with daddy issues cannot stay in stable relationships they are quick to emotionally overinvest in men but the moment a man emotionally invests in them they freak out the only way to tame a woman with daddy issues is to enforce the alpha male quid pro quo strictly which most men cannot do fourth emotional overinvestment is unattractive because it subconsciously indicates to her that your emotional experience sucks women are constantly monitoring where a man is directing his thoughts and emotions and if that man is emotionally overinvesting in people and things that provide him nothing in return she will subconsciously feel like his life is not attractive think about it if you are starving and talk about eating sandwiches for hours a day people with well rounded lives are not going to enjoy being around you instead they will feel sad and annoyed by you in addition women have a very keen sense of their own value and if they feel like they are providing you little value but you are emotionally overinvesting in them then they subconsciously assume the rest of your life has little value as well this feeling is sometimes irrational because giving women a little extra attention does not mean your life actually sucks but the lizard mind is irrational fifth emotional overinvestment in somebody indicates that you are beneath them in the subconscious dominance hierarchy we all carry around in our heads the dominance hierarchy stays together because the lower ranked apes emotionally invest in the higher ranked ones and do things for them so if somebody emotionally over invests in you you subconsciously assume they are beneath you in the dominance hierarchy people s perceptions of the dominance hierarchy are completely irrational if a billionaire does too much for a homeless woman she may feel higher than him even though in reality she is not in addition it feels bad when you realize you are occupying all of a person s thoughts and emotions because if you slip up and do the wrong thing they will become extremely angry and upset counter intuitively when you know that you are competing with other stuff for their thoughts and emotions you feel less pressure of course sometimes very insecure or weak people hold their nose and stay in relationships with people that are too emotionally invested in them because they prefer the shitty feeling of being pressured to the shitty feeling of being alone and of course sometimes women hold their nose and stay with men that are overly emotionally invested because they want money a nice house to live in social status etc by the way women can get emotionally overinvested too in fact when women emotionally overinvest in men it is often much worse which is why women get freaked out so much by men who emotionally overinvest they know the feeling i have always been surprised by how i get turned off by women who are too into me i have had really hot and cool chicks blow it with me because they did way too much on some level i think i was afraid that i was feeding their craziness and if i didn t dismiss them i would end up in a cage in their basement what can women do for you women can do a lot of things for you teach you something entertain you do errands for you compliment you buy you something or simply contribute to a good conversation the only criteria is that she must meaningfully and objectively contribute to your life texting you complimenting you and just being hot are contributions but they are very mild contributions and don t deserve much in return if a woman gets in a car and comes to meet you at a bar it is ok to buy her a drink but if she is just standing at the bar looking hot then no to understand women s contributions in a more abstract way think of it like this women contribute by helping you pursue your purposes whatever they may be and your purposes ideally involve venturing into the unknown conquering some challenge and bringing back some resource to share with those that have helped you the more a woman helps you in your purposes and the more important of the purpose she helps you with the more she deserves for example a woman that helps you get a job at a company you want to work for is contributing way more than a woman who buys you a beer and most importantly women should help you pursue your purposes not be your purpose most men fail the alpha male quid pro quo by doing too much for the woman but some men fail because they do not do enough if a woman does meaningfully contribute to your emotional experience you should reward her proportionately to what she has done women seek acceptance and if they feel like they cannot get it from you they will move on and get it from somebody else a woman may be intrigued by a man who ignores her but she will not want to remain ignored forever at some point she will want acceptance from somebody even if he is not her first choice this is a very important point women are very sensitive to rejection and the phrase hell hath no fury like a woman scorned is true if a woman feels like you have affirmatively rejected her she will never be able to trust you again because evolutionarily rejection means that you left the woman in the woods by herself to starve the key to getting women to do things for you is to be very warm and welcoming so she feels comfortable putting herself out there women are terrified of rejection so you must make her feel comfortable doing things and emotionally investing in you you must also fairly reward her for her contributions to keep her feeling welcome to do things for you it is often difficult to determine what exactly is fair because it is impossible for you to accurately keep track of every single thing you have done for each other as a man you are also prone to emotionally overinvest in a woman especially at the beginning stages of the interaction therefore to be safe you should do significantly less for her than she does for you but not so little that she feels rejected getting good at this requires practice and feel i can t tell you what would be fair in every situation the more the woman emotionally invests in you the easier it becomes to maintain the alpha male quid pro quo because she will constantly be doing stuff for you and she will build up a large account that you will be able to draw against without going negative women want to do things for men they are attracted to and indeed your challenge will be to reward her fairly but women normally take longer than men to emotionally invest so you need to very cognizant of the alpha male quid pro quo in the beginning stages of the relationship including when you first meet her escalation escalation is just a process you reward her for emotionally investing in you the more she emotionally invests in you the more she will feel attracted and the more she will expect and desire for you to escalate by paying her attention inviting her to do things and making sexual advances the key to escalating however is waiting until after she has emotionally invested which means you should wait until after she has done things for you here is an example she does something small for you she gets dolled up and looking hot to go out that night you reward her with a proportionate amount of attention you walk up to her and say you look amazing tonight she does something bigger for you she smiles and says thank you you reward her with more attention and escalation you ask what is your name etc as the night goes on the stakes get bigger and bigger so later for example she contributes by having a long conversation about something interesting and you reward her for complimenting and then inviting to do something with you later it does not matter exactly what you do it just has to be proportionate to what she has done at some point you may accidentally press the gas too hard and show her too much attention or escalate too quickly causing her to recoil or say no that s fine just act like nothing happened withdraw your attention and wait until she emotionally invests later for example let s say you try to kiss her and she says no you laugh say something to show it s not a big deal hey i tried and immediately go back to whatever you were doing as if nothing happened then later in the night when she is ready you can try again when you get good at this you will be able to read women and tell when they are ready for the next step but until then it s just practice at any point she may stop contributing walk away do something shitty etc in that case you should just withdraw your attention and get distracted by something else oftentimes i will approach a woman at a party and when the conversation starts to go stale i wander away and come back later you should not get butthurt call her out or complain you should act like a little child that got distracted by some other shiny thing so she feels like you have lots of options and do not get when one of your options poops out for some reason you should remember that women take a while to emotionally invest in men so if a woman ignores you or does not show you interest right away it does not necessarily mean that she has something against you you may have just not shown your life to be fun enough to yet of course sometimes women just do not like you no matter how well you execute the alpha male quid pro quo or they may be shitty people that actively want to harm your life or take advantage of you in those cases it is fine to just withdraw your attention beginning the relationship if you have been following my logic so far you may be thinking if i were to follow the alpha male quid pro quo strictly i would never approach or escalate with a new woman because they would not have done anything for me this would make it impossible for me to meet women because most women do not make the first move this is actually an important point no matter what a woman has done for you all women merit you approaching them once just the fact that they left the house put some pants on and tried to make themselves look pretty is enough of a contribution to merit you saying hello and introducing yourself when women are getting ready to go out they are dolling themselves up to impress the alpha male they just do not know it is you yet of course once you have introduced yourself the onus is back on her to do something to merit more and deeper attention from you but every woman gets one free approach not a drink not a conversation just a warm friendly approach even if you don t buy my alpha male quid pro quo theory you should still feel comfortable approaching people because a pure approach by itself is never creepy what makes it creepy is staring at her too long sticking around after she has shown she is not interested in talking to you etc but approaching is a normal part of human interaction and is necessary for people to ever meet blue haired feminists that say you should never approach a woman are just stupid they are confining themselves to a prison where the only people they will ever meet are friends of friends the purpose of an approach is to communicate i am warm friendly and welcoming enough to give you the chance to validate yourself to me women are very sensitive to rejection which is why they are so afraid to approach men they find attractive think of a tribe as hierarchy the alpha male sits at the top of the hierarchy and the status of the individual members is determined by the alpha depending on what they have done for the tribe the losers and enemies of the tribe sit outside of the tribe s walls they are excluded from the hierarchy completely when you approach women you subconsciously communicate you can enter the walls of the tribe but if you want to move up you need to work for it and by the way you should never reject a woman unless you are absolutely sure that your rejection is permanent i once joined a very prestigious law firm famous for being a meat grinder they would hire new lawyers a year but only about or would last long enough to actually make partner during my second week the firm s most important partner approached me and asked me about a case i was working on despite my nervousness the partner was very warm and friendly and i can still remember like yesterday him responding to something i said by saying great now you re thinking like a partner of course that s bullshit i wasn t even close to being a partner i was just another slab of meat for the meat grinder and like most lawyers the firm hired i would probably not last long enough to become partner if i fucked up he could fire me and give my work to one of the other lawyers he had hired that year but in that moment the firm s most important partner made me feel like i had a legitimate shot at succeeding in this law firm and really that s the whole point of every approach you are trying to subconsciously communicate to the woman that she has a genuine chance at joining your awesome life if she does a good job the ceo walking up and shaking your hand does not mean that you are guaranteed to move up but it least means you are not fired and when you approach women you should act as if the new hire is naturally eager to validate themselves to the ceo additionally to address this paradox you must realize that as the alpha male it is your job to find what the woman can meaningfully contribute to your emotional experience women often have a lot to contribute but you need to draw it out of them a lot of women that look hot plain or boring on the outside actually have a lot of interesting thoughts and abilities and a strong desire to put herself at the service of an attractive man if you are confident and creative enough you can find something about almost any woman that she can contribute and that will merit you giving her attention and compliments think about it this way the more you can get her to contribute the more attention you can justify paying her of course some women cannot and do not want to contribute anything to you and that s fine you can just move on you can draw out what is interesting about a woman with targeted questions the purpose is not to do an interview but to find something about her that is fun and interesting she can share so you can both explore it together for example if you approach a woman and compliment her dress or something you can follow it up by saying something like but are you as interesting as you are hot yes that sounds corny but it actually taps into a deep desire that every human being has the desire to feel appreciated for some value be bipolar of course in the real world random women you approach do not always immediately see you as the ceo they are trying to impress in the real world women have no idea who you are and may have no desire whatsoever to talk to you in the real world sometimes the intern says to the ceo eww gross get the fuck out of my face but nevertheless you should still act as if you are the ceo warmly giving a brand new intern a shot at proving themselves humans see all relationships as power relationships so the alternative to acting like the ceo is acting like a loser begging for her validation or more abstractly a loser begging for entrance into the tribe s walls which women are not attracted to therefore to successfully implement the alpha male quid pro quo you must sometimes act somewhat bipolar you approach a woman with warmth and kindness but the moment she does not reciprocate you shift to your attention elsewhere as if she does not exist you may need to leave a conversation mid sentence without saying a word if she is not being pleasant you may need to leave a date that was going well because it started going south you may need to stare at a woman blankly or suddenly remember that you needed to call your uncle when she asks you to do something she does not deserve from you being bipolar is hard for many reasons first it just feels weird and is a change from how you normally act usually when you like somebody you continue to like them even if they start being a little shitty or distant but being bipolar requires you to immediately do a the hardest part of being bipolar is taking yourself out of the emotional flow of the interaction to do the right thing you may be having a great time with a woman but still need to pump the brakes if she is trying to take more than she is giving being bipolar is also hard because women will beg plead and even cry for you to do things for them they do not deserve they will threaten to leave shame you insult you and try to make you jealous it does not matter you cannot give in you must follow the alpha male quid pro quo they themselves do not realize that they are begging for you to do something that will make them lose respect for you the key to being bipolar is to see yourself as an unemotional observer that pays women attention for their objective contributions and not because of your own feelings a good way to get acclimated to this new way of thinking is to commit to complimenting any woman you see who deserves a compliment just make the compliment smile and leave some women may assume you are just another creep trying to fuck them but once they see you really just wanted to pay a compliment they will appreciate it as i stated earlier understanding this stuff should make you more likely to approach not less because implementing the alpha male quid pro quo is so unnatural and outside the normal way people act at first you will feel strange uncomfortable or like you are being an asshole and superficially you will actually appears to some people as being an asshole but the alpha male quid pro quo works because it taps into something deep and primal about human beings the feeling that we only deserve attention in proportion to what we have done by the way when a woman does not contribute you should not feel butthurt or angry nor should you ever call women out you should just move on you should be like a happy retard running to whatever seems most interesting and fun at that moment if a woman rejects or ignores you just bounce to the next one like nothing happened why men emotionally overinvest of course this is all easier said than done because most men especially in modern society emotionally overinvest in women this partly occurs for three reasons men evolved to emotionally invest in women quicker because women are looking for a long term mate men evolved to impregnate as many women as possible in a short as time as possible women however evolved to seek a mate who will be reliable over the long term to protect and provide for the child over a period of years therefore women have a longer list of criteria that a potential mate needs to meet and require a longer analysis period to determine whether the man is worth being sexually attracted to men however often become emotionally invested in a woman just by seeing she is hot as a practical matter this means that most men blow it with women because they do something needy right at the beginning of the interaction the moment they see a hot woman they decide to buy her a drink do her a favor or pay her more attention she deserves which causes the woman to immediately eliminate them from consideration this also causes the man to text too much overshare or feel like he has a closer emotional connection with her than he really does there is however a silver lining here once you realize that most men are eliminated from the jump you can immediately set yourself apart by strictly implementing the alpha male quid pro quo you just need to control your emotions as a red blooded american male when i see a hot chick walking down the street my first impulse is to follow her home so i can tell her i want to eat ice cream out of her ass but because i know about the alpha male quid pro quo i restrain myself this article is too long for reddit please read the rest at my website
17311,act nature is weird part a evolved proficiency in the non verbal if you believe the history books that ancient sumeria was the first civilization with language that means humans have been around for years but only formally speaking for years like much of evolutionary psychology this is going to be a case of people navigating modern times using a brain developed for navigating the jungle genetics evolve slower than culture and brains and biology haven t quite caught up to the generational fluctation humans are unique from other animals in that they evolved by successfully collaborating with other humans favoring brain processes hardwired for cooperation such as mirror neurons mere exposure effect and cheater detection module this tribe altruism allowed for specialization of labor where men could hunt and woman could make homes and as long as you were good at getting along in a group then you had cooked meat to eat and protection from predators success of the individual was predicated on a inclusion of a group and b the success of that group so humans evolved having to depend on each other in groups but much like the rest of the animal kingdom without a language they had to get pretty good at communicating using things other than words body language and gestures part b social contract dominance hierarchies exist in nature so that in these groups before we could express boundaries and expectations in a written word people knew their place and behaved in a way that reduces intra group conflict this is basic stuff but generally the alpha of the group is the best hunter and has the most access to mates and earns this right as he is also primarily responsible for physical protection of the group people lower on the totem pole trade their subordinance to the alpha for food and protection if everybody in a group plays their role this is a mutually beneficial way to coexist the alpha can let his guard down within the group knowing he won t have to won t have to fight for his status and the people lower on the pole feel secure in his leadership if somebody behaved in a way detrimental to the group they risk being lowered on the dominance hierarchy to the point of ostracization so it is ingrained human nature to maintain status quo and go along with the role handed to you this is called playing along with the social contact highly recommend reading this whole page for better background on this exclusion from the group likely means death this is why children have a physiological reaction to being bullied or unliked modern man is obsessed with reputation and how they appear to other people because their ancestors lives depended on it this is also why men have a physiological response in fear of approaching girls if only the alpha male has mating access rights and behavior detrimental to your place in the group meant death then guys who do not feel like an alpha male will feel uncomfortable expressing their sexuality around women conversely this means guys who do feel entitled to sex with women must be the alpha male of their group the human gestation period of months is the second longest in the animal kingdom behind elephants so women must be selective about whom they mate with this investment is large on her part so it is important the genes are good it is also important they are mating with someone high status who will ensure their protection as they will be unable to provide food or escape prey for these months and a few months after so it is mutual only the alpha male may be sexually forward and women only want to mate with the alpha male before times of social media and urbanization humans generally only knew the same people in their life time and these people knew your whole history you couldn t lie about your status or fake it til you make it as everybody in your tribe knew everything about you you couldn t just wake up one day and act out of place on the heirarchy i e feel entitled to sex and approach girls you would be reprimanded for it and your existence depends on inclusion in the group fast forward to where men and women are still living with brains hardwired for these days it s no wonder why most men are afraid to approach women and women are attracted to men that show forwardness and confidence by having an attitude of willingness to engage a female boldly and sexually you are hacking her brain and subcommunicating much about you and your value already without you having to say a word this is a nonverbal subcommunication that you are an alpha and there for worthy of mating with part venus and mars intragender communication is drenched in these types of sub communication and while almost of women are inherently fluent and native speakers of sub communication their reproductive screening process is heavily predicated on it a large percentage of guys have no idea it even exists as alluded to in the section about women s selectivity woman and men have different mating strategies women focus on quality and men focus on quantity if a man sees a good enough looking female he is usually willing to mate with her without much personality screening at all since his minimum investment in the child is the minutes that it took to create it men as a byproduct have very different brains when it comes to being attracted to a mate and often the only subcommunication process involved is a visual one screening for fertility this is quick binary and non nuanced does she meet my threshold of youth symmetry and hip waist ratio etc because of this men are often mystified by the actual process of attracting females and how it could boil down to more than physical looks of course being visually attractive still helps being tall and muscular does subcommunicate genetic fitness to girls likelihood their child performs well on the dominance heirarchy and becomes an alpha so you can build on a case of subcommunicating alphaness through building muscle but this is a secondary requisite to dominant personality traits act programmed to fail besides the obvious advice of being muscular and sexually forward that is frequently recommended here some men still need a more detailed roadmap of how to navigate sub communications albert mehrabian says in his book silent messages that words spoken are only of communication i personally think this seems too little if you think about great speeches they are more than only as good as the words spoken in them but i digress every statement and behavior has a surface level meaning but the recipient of the message now also has a subcurrent of deeper inferences about your status or lifestyle implied by your behavior sample how to use this to your advantage observed behaviors can often trigger unconscious responses that give clues to deeper impressions about one s objective value in the sexual marketplace a good deal of sexual communication is covert hardwired biological cues do happen in nature where animals unconsciously always follow a behavorial script in response to a certain stimulus this also works in human mating but not like most guys think more on that later what gets us into trouble is not what we don t know it s what we know for sure that just ain t so mark twain a lot of what we believe we know about nature is counter intuitive as men we were programmed from a young age by movies and tv that being a loyally obedient slave to a pretty girl for long enough will make her magically want to be with you seeing the same script time and again the patient kind reserved character loyally waits for the girl to be done with all of the jerks and in the end earns romantic attention with the target of his interests by exhibiting friendly and supportive behavior for long enough this aiming to please behavior is subcommunicated to men through movies and tv as a suitable way to attract a mate so lots of men unconsciously mimic the strategy this does actually trigger a reciprocal behavior cue in women but unfortunately for most men it is not unwavering affection and mindblowing sex but rather psychological recategorization to friend or provider zone this friend zone usually involves a maybe carrot dangled in front of his face to keep him investing in her with the implication that maybe one day she will pick him as a passionate sexual partner traditionally dependent on men for resources for thousands of years as hunter gatherers women have evolved to find security in a reasonable expectation that men will support them modern day women play this carrot dangling game as a way to feel secure in their survival they engineer these relationships so that they have a cast of men who orbit them like a star they keep them close enough to be in the gravitational pull but never actually colliding the scope of the evolutionary biology section of this post does not extend into alpha fucks beta bucks but there is an observed dualistic mating strategy observed in primates and anecdotally in humans women have two motives for using sex primal in an intimate reproductive urge to obtain genes from a partner passion and horniness transactional in a survivalist exchange to obtain resources from a partner female bonobos will trade sex for food and women will marry rich men they are not sexually attracted to despite what movies and tv shows tell you when men are overly nice to women in hopes of courting her romantically women instinctively realize there is an attempt to iniate a favor for sex contract a misperceived mating cue an eagerness to transactionally exchange favors for sex may subcommunicate to the female that a man wants sex but has a lack of confidence in his sexuality forwardness remember earlier this not an alpha for genetics sake and she will deem him not a a suitable partner for primal sex and only consider sex with him in a transactional setting aside from biology a few other reasons this fails this is non congruent behavior like how ghandi said he would never try to achieve peace by war and you should never try to grow an apple tree by planting an orange seed you should not try to use supplicating friendship to achieve a sexual relationship when you overtly put effort in to try to attract somebody you become dependent on the outcome you focus on things you can t control and you start acting weird everyone can imagine the experience of trying too hard to get someone to like you and having it not work most people can also recall the inverse a situation where you were indifferent to somebody and naturally they gravitate towards you even the subcommunication of an attempted pursuit implies the pursuer believes they have something to gain from their relationship to their pursuant and this puts the pursuant in a position of power indifference makes the difference beyond being nice and resource providing movies and tv shows also promote bragging to girls or attempting to win them over with material goods accolades or accomplishments this is called qualifying yourself and it also falls under the subcommunicating low value umbrella basically the thought is that if you have to convince someone how amazing you are you must not believe that the product is good enough to be sold without salesmanship this trying too hard makes it seem like you have not had success with women in the past and if previous women who have had the time to determine if you were worthy of mating decided you were not a suitable partner then she should save time and just trust other people s researched judgement this social proof or lack thereof subcommunication creates a knee jerk reaction in all people to heuristically assign value to things without subjective appraisal you see it everywhere everyone is wearing these shoes they must be cool or the election day special everyone hates this politician he must suck beyond these obvious programming of meta male female behaviors that produce unfavorable subcommunications modern entertainment promotes many popular tropes and micro actions that seem like a good way to get girls but actually subcommunicate low mating value to her amp x b act modern sub communication in practice i will now break down a few examples of these counter intuitive games and identify the difference between the intended communication by the male and the actual communication achieved give it away asking to be exclusive bf gf too soon intended communication behind action romantic gesture i like you a lot i m a good guy who s looking for a relationship programmed expected response with the premise that girls want a good guy who s looking for a relationship acting like you want to rush into monogamy will increase a girls attraction to you reality implies lack of other options implies lack of social proof implies low value a deep dive into the sex commitment trade between male and female across primate evolution shows that high value men traditionally prefer multiple female sex partners see harems and do not feel the need to initiate an exclusive relationship in order to have sex an over eagerness to commit implies no other options and if it seems very sudden or undeserved it makes a girl wonder why our logical minds are often skeptical of too good to be true situations can i do better her subconscious wonders correct course of action hang out with girl have fun and have sex do not talk about exclusivity first at all she will bring it up when she is ready let her chase you and earn your commitment she will enjoy the relationship more feeling like she had worked for it to play into the sex commitment trade off men are the gatekeepers of commitment and women are the gatekeepers of sex men trade commitment for sex women trade sex for commitment this is an analogous argument to the idea that girls should withhold sex until marriage and make you work for it and then you ll value her more why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free in accounting it you don t know how to properly value an asset you just price it at the cost of acquisition a girl will value your commitment with direct proportionality to how hard she had to work to obtain it saying i love you first or too early is a sub umbrella of this a woman wants to feel like she has earned your love after relentless chasing and will not value it if you re eager to give it away side note being said rules are meant to be broken and you should never be afraid of rejection if you re absolutely secure in your relationship and are a romantic guy and want to enter monogamy and express your love verbally by all means do so a confident declaration of passion for a girl can be a fun memory for the both of you later in life just don t be a sucker for love and do it for the sake of doing it or worse because you feel like it s going to make you seem more attractive because it s not being afraid to disagree break rapport intended communication behind action i agree with you we have similar viewpoints and i respect you programmed expected response she will think we are more compatible now and therefore like me more reality if guy is afraid to disagree something to lose implies low value non masculine girls want a guy who says what he wants is not afraid to dissent from group they want a risk taker and a firm decision maker who is ready at all times just incase they don t feel like making any correct course of action be yourself but don t overly agree with her on every point because you think you re building rapport your lack of polarity is making you boring this fear of disagreeability subcommunicates a being afraid to dissent from a group someone afraid to speak his mind is someone who feels obligated to be agreeable for status and protection so likely not an alpha in a time where groupthink and social cascades are at an all time high and echo chamber social media sites like reddit and twitter tell you what the only appropriate talking points are there is a too familiar comfort in being agreeable and a discomfort in the tension involved with breaking script tangent on tension and shit tests imagine you re out at a bar and out of nowhere a pound body builder seems ready to kill you he gets in your face stares you in the eyes and slowly says in a menacing way what did you say to me imagine holding eye contact with him for seconds silent with a scorn on your face imagine how quick you d want to diffuse it as a natural reaction what no i didn t say anything you d probably say it quickly and panicked too your subconscious concession just to let him know where you stand on the idea of confrontation with him now imagine a hot girl eyes you from across the room she comes over to you slowly gets right up in your face stares you in the eyes and slowly says do you wanna fuck me imagine how quick you d defuse the tension and say something imagine holding eye contact for seconds and not saying anything with a smirk on your face tension is a necessary phase for many human interactions attraction included many guys think they can bypass this by being agreeable a girl will purposefully and often times subconciously test a mans strength by creating tension to see how he responds to it a man who cannot handle tension with a pound girl probably can t handle it with a pound man so by seeing how he reacts to these situations she can test whether or not he would have been an alpha in the group thousands of years ago these tension creations are commonly referred to as shit tests sometimes girls will feign disgust towards you just to see what you re made of shit tests are beyond the scope of this post but they actually are a good thing they subcommunicate that you are engaging woman s reproductive screening process women don t shit test homeless guys they want to see how you crack under pressure the best way to fail a shit test is to take it seriously speaking of shit tests a lot of this conditioning from society can be looked at as one massive scale shit test from feminist america what s to be gained from telling a generation of men it s quirky and cute when guys are nervous and passive and the be a nice guy don t be a fuckboy it weeds out leaders from followers men who were born to be subordinate will go along and orbit and men who were born to be leaders will differentiate themselves and be easily identified to be fucked this shit test is responsible for the recent consent rabbit hole we ve gotten into where girls will be a feminist marching in the streets saying don t objectify me and then go home and cum times on a guy who chokes her and spits in her mouth obviously consent is important and legitimate rape is horrible but you should read a few pages from women s erotica if you want to know how they actually want to be treated in the bedroom the next example has to do with this certain trope i generally see movie tv conditioning with this one in things targeted towards teens but it still seeps into their subconscious being a pussy this is an obvious one but i mean it by not pulling the trigger when its time to make a move or asking for the date when a conversation has reached that point fear of forwardness gt implies low status like asking a girl to kiss or asking if you can touch her boobs in bed intended communication behind action i respect you as a woman and value feminism and consent programmed expected response she will be more attracted to me knowing that i m respectful and ideologically align with feminism reality afraid of rejection has no experience lack of social proof and dominance lead her to infer you are low on the totem pole dont feel deserving of love in your masculine aura so you re resorting to seeking love from your feminine aura and therefor she thinks you have bad genes and doesn t wanna fuck you oftentimes guys with this one will have massive issues with self sexuality they are male apologists if ever in a situation where sexual tension occurs they will self eject blowing up a situation on purpose so they can take ownership of rejection i have a particular dispicable blue pill example of a friend he s a big cnn liberal and feminist virgin at we went to community college together and there was an abundance of hot girls just sitting around there so my biggest hobby at the time became day gaming in the cafeteria normal shit see a girl sitting alone go up and say hey i thought you were cute and wanted to meet you cheesy but it was and worked more often than not anyways one time he sees me sitting with a girl and comes over and sit with us me and the girl were already having a sexuality charged convo we were talking about erogenous zones we like kissed and she asked his input as to where he liked to be kissed he shamefully looked away and nervously said i like pizza trying to be quirky and random but he self ejected as a sexual candidate due his own feelings of inferiority like lawyers when they start losing in a case and feel inferior adopt a stance of fig leafing covering their genitals communicating such a low sexual status that they prefer girls not think of them as sexual vehicles at all they get needy and over text call reaching out constantly because they are insecure and think relationships operate on a linear communication scale amount of text exchanged quality of relationship don t understand the concept of absence makes the heart grow fonder text messages are like cakes they take a couple hours to bake sometimes so don t always reply right away it would be like taking a cake out of the oven too early intended communication behind action i m thinking about you i want to talk to you i m consistent programmed expected response she will be more attracted to me knowing that i like her and our constant talking will build rapport and closeness amount of communication is linearly correlated with strength of relationship reality no mystery no chase no wondering girls are scientifically more attracted to guys when they are unsure how they feel they make gf their therapist overshare problems and complain constantly intended communication behind action i value you as an equal and friend and want to vent about things that are impacting me programmed expected response she will be attracted to my vulnerability we will get closer and girls say they love guys with emotions and sensitive side reality she thinks you re bad vibes and subconsciously not fit to be a father of her children because you re easily frazzled dry panties they say you can have your gf be your gf or your therapist but she can t play both roles well imagine having a draining parent that always wants to complain to you thats how a girl feels when you complain about your problems to her she wants you to be a good vibes leader in conclusion anyways gents the point here is not to get you constantly over thinking about subcommunication because overthinking is the stem of most of these problems in the first place but if you ve never thought of the concept before and you can t seem to tell where you re going wrong with girls this might be a good place to start be honest with yourself look for ways you could be unconsciously projecting low quality behavior the shadow psyche finds ways to manifest and leak into the present so if you have preconceived notions of low self esteem or self limiting beliefs about woman and their attitudes towards you and you may be projecting that onto your partner without even realizing it women are naturally more socially emotionally perceptive than men can even comprehend evolutionarily as the physically inferior sex woman have relied on cunning to ensure their survival for thousands of years more on that in a later post but the point is when your vibe is off and you re feeling low value a girl can smell it a mile away even if you think you re hiding it so while it is important to appear relaxed and confident to subcommunicate sexual worthiness it is equally important to actually live a lifestyle that makes you feel relaxed and confident this means socializing exercising reading and meditation while cutting back on things that waste time and make you feel shameful like masterbating drugs junk food and video games tl dr be muscular sexually forward and indifferent towards women make sure you re subcomminicating masculinity and perceived self worth
17617,one thing guys struggle with and go back and forth with is this apparent contradiction between getting laid a lot and being a good man mainstream media normies tend to focus on the possible negative aspects of getting laid chasing shallow temporary highs using women having meaningless sex that doesn t improve your life quite a lot of guys have asked me if getting laid is superficial it s something a lot of guys worry about am i just being shallow by chasing girls is this just self indulgence hedonism is this ultimately just a waste of time sure if you chase a bunch of one night stands

definitely in my case that can take years of improving yourself tens of thousands of rejections a tonne of insecurities you have to work through a million failures a million moments when you want to give up if building a kickass sex life was easy everybody would do it and putting yourself through that grinder going through all that pain and suffering and coming out the other side a success story teaches you something no natural can ever know you ll understand the power of setting a goal and working on it relentlessly for months or years never ever giving up you ll understand the power of taking baby steps towards your goal every single day you ll understand how to deal with rejection you ll understand not everybody will like you you ll understand sacrifice you ll understand pushing yourself when all you want to do is give up and you ll understand the power of perseverance most importantly of all you ll realise you are capable of far more than you ever thought possible after all if you just achieved something of the male population could never even fathom doing themselves there s nothing that can stop you you ll know you can achieve any goal you set your mind to as long as you put in the work know what else getting laid a lot teaches you the numbers game you ll understand that achieving anything in life is just a matter of trying trying again then trying again then trying again if you want a kickass job just apply to firms and one of them will say yes if you want a kickass social circle just meet people and a few of them will be absolute legends if you want to build your own business just fail times and eventually you ll be successful everything in life you could ever want is right there for the taking and all you have to do is put in the hard work and play the numbers game you ll wake up one day and say to yourself if i could bang girls which took a hell of a lot of work and effort and time and patience nothing s stopping me from making a million dollars that ll just take a few years of consistent daily effort but it s not impossible i got laid a lot so i can definitely do this getting laid teaches you that you can have anything you want amp x b getting laid boosts your ego amp gives you validation normies and mainstream dolts criticise guys who want to get laid using tired rhetoric and complete drivel like you only want to get laid to stroke your ego and get validation no shit sherlock of fucking course getting laid boosts your ego achieving any big goal does that s the entire fucking point of achieving anything so you can prove to yourself that you re more capable stronger smarter better ego is just another word for self esteem something you should absolutely be aiming to increase and improve every single day you re on this earth validation too it s oh so important most guys who find my site feel like a loser they feel like they re not worth a damn like they re not important like the universe has stamped on their forehead you don t matter having girls sleep with you and be nice to you and be really into you absolutely strips away that feeling of i m not important after all if these girls like you and think you re great then you must be at least slightly ok as a human being and as a man right when most guys first start working on their sex dating life validation is the main draw that brings them to my site and others like me it s great motivation to push yourself to improve to push yourself to start getting laid to work on yourself and become a better human being validation from girls validation from other guys it s all important a coaching client of mine said it best to be honest a big part of this is about being viewed as elite by other people and getting laid a lot would make me someone who definitely is humans care about what others think of them that s unavoidable validation will meet a lot to you at the start especially the first few times a girl is really sweet to you you ll cherish those memories for years to come and yes over time as you gain confidence and start to achieve your goals you ll naturally care less about what others think of you you ll become more self assured you ll need less validation from others your own opinion of yourself will be more important but you ll still care what others think to some degree i certainly still care what you think of me right now i want you to like me i want you to think i m smart and wise and experienced and a good person maybe those things are ego validation and i should dissolve my ego and stop seeing validation but i don t think i m supposed to i don t believe any human is supposed to be completely ego less nor should they ever completely stop seeking validation from others none of us are an island we re not supposed to completely shut off the opinions of others to do so would be a very lonely and cold existence indeed validation is a very very valid and deeply important reason for you to start getting laid maybe it s the most important reason of all there is no greater injustice in the universe than a man or any person really going to their grave feeling like they didn t matter feeling like they weren t really all that important feeling like they could have and should have had more you fucking matter go get laid amp x b getting laid improves your looks style amp body one beautiful side effect of trying to

perhaps a slight exaggeration and i m always adding more stories about strippers somes with virgins sex in public sex with girls within minutes of meeting them bdsm sex crazy girls and many many more i ve never felt more alive than in the moments when i m out there creating these amazing memories i ll still hold onto when i m old and grey getting laid a tonne makes you feel alive and sharing those stories with others getting them as excited and passionate to improve their own lives and create their own wild memories is what life is all about we re not meant to sit on the couch feeling depressed

bring shy girls out of their shell getting laid helps you understand what women want and you ll be able to give it to them amp x b getting laid lowers how much drama you put up with i ve talked about it many times on my site and in my podcasts i used to have a drama filled life when it came to girls i d tolerate crazy girls i d get caught up in fights i had my fair share of abusive relationships i used to put up with all that because i thought that was what i deserved i genuinely didn t think i deserved any better as i got laid more i started realising i didn t deserve to be putting up with all that bullshit and nightmare fuel i met a tonne of really cool girls who didn t cause any drama and i started craving that relaxed stress free life more and more eventually i started screening out girls who showed the slightest hint of drama and life became a billion times easier every single one of my mates and coaching clients who ve started getting laid have all moved away from drama and towards more chilled girls which in turn makes your entire life run a lot more smooth it s hard to enjoy your life when it s constantly full of bullshit stress nagging angst and misery getting laid makes life a lot more chill amp x b getting laid makes you more confident and self assured there s something magical about knowing you can get laid whenever you want there s so much self assurance that comes with it it s life changing it becomes your superpower that confidence and self assuredness translates to you being more fun to be around more fun to hang out with at parties funnier and with a better sense of humour and just generally cooler all round people will sense your confidence and gravitate towards you wanting to be friends with you socialising becomes a million times easier not least because you aren t so neurotic insecure and anxious about not being cool or confident enough you also become more ok with the fact you re not always perfect you won t always be alpha and you won t always have the answers you stop struggling so much and find an inner peace with it all completely accepting and embracing the fact that sometimes you really suck and in doing so you reach a sort of zen like confidence and calmness where life doesn t kick your ass even th as much as it used to sometimes i suck hell often i suck but who gives a shit i really like who i am getting laid makes you glad that you are you amp x b getting laid gives you an abundance mentality the second most painful feeling known to man is oneitis that feeling of being so dependent and hopelessly needy with one particular woman that he can t think of anything else losing your mind going crazy over her making emotional and erratic decisions that only make you feel worse about yourself but unable to quit her or move on and the most painful feeling worse than even oneitis is having no girls at all the solution is to go out and talk to more girls get laid a bunch and build the sex life you deserve when you get to that magical place of knowing you can get laid no longer will you be manipulated or held hostage with implied or direct threats of a girl withdrawing her pussy or turning you down you ll never worry about what to say around a woman or worry you re doing the wrong thing or worry about what you should do you lose that awful walking on eggshells feeling most guys have with girls where they re terrified if they don t please the woman and do everything right she ll leave him and as a result you ll be a man who does what he wants you also won t care about rejections anymore how the hell can you care about being rejected when other girls already liked you enough to sleep with you and you know there s countless more out there who d love to get to know you you get to a point where you don t even notice rejections anymore they don t even register to you all you focus on and all you care about are all the kickass girls who sleep with you and have a good time with you you ll also sleep with hotter women the more abundance you have it s hard to walk up to a superhottie and hit on her when you don t have much experience go get laid more times and you ll feel your confidence rising to the point where you can finally hit on and start to sleep with the women you actually want to sleep with getting laid makes you a man with options amp x b getting laid gives you freedom so you can move on freedom the most important of goals and the thing you should strive for above all else a man cannot be happy when he s a slave a slave to what others want a slave to his own emotions a slave to his own unmet needs and when you re stuck in the i can t get laid phase you feel those chains so acutely they become at times unbearable when you get to a point where you have true abundance when it comes to women you ll feel truly free no longer shackled by your inability to have sex and with that area of your life handled you ll be able to spend your time however you want giving your undivided attention to whatever goal or mission you choose next a lot of people call this abundance mentality a pretty apt phrase you know you have an abundance of women and you know if you ever run out you just have to go out and talk to more girls and you ll have a new one within a few days it s this knowledge you can get laid that takes away a huge chunk of your stress and allows you to move on some guys live it up at this point going wild with crazy sex and truly having the time of their lives others choose to settle down and have a long term partner or start a family others keep getting laid but make it a background goal like i have while they focus on their new mission getting laid is a phase so give it of all you ve got go all in and have as much fun with it as you possible can while it s still amazingly fun and fresh and new and rewarding eventually it ll be time to move on to the next new rewarding mission but you ll never truly be able to move on if you don t get laid as much as you truly want to getting laid lets you spread your wings and fly amp x b getting laid allows you to give back to the world similar to increasing your empathy getting laid puts you in a position where you can give back to the world it makes you less self centered and more focused on others more selfless i never would have dedicated all my time to helping others improve their lives if i hadn t handled my sex life and gotten laid a lot when i couldn t get laid i wanted to help other people but i just couldn t i was too caught up in my own pain frustration and loneliness to ever be much use to anybody else i see this a lot guys desperately trying to help others but unable to really give much back when they re still unfulfilled themselves there s a reason flight attendants tell you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others you ve gotta meet your own needs in order to help others meet theirs i have so much time care energy love to give to other people solely because i gave myself permission to get laid a lot my website my forums my podcast all the people i ve helped and all those people who ve gone on to help others none of that exists if i hadn t gotten laid a lot getting laid allows you to better serve and help others amp x b getting laid means you won t manipulate women the more you empathise with women the more cool girls you meet the more you ll want to treat them decently and not bullshit them especially as you feel yourself building up an abundance mentality you won t see any reason or need to ever lie or manipulate you won t need to trick girls into bed with you not when there s other women waiting around the corner to jump on your dick you ll start seeing sex less as using each other or taking from each other and more like what it really is two people who want the same thing a fun time good sex and someone cool to chill with you ll relax and be a lot more honest knowing if one particular girl doesn t reciprocate or appreciate your honesty you ll simply move on getting laid makes you an honest chilled dude amp x b getting laid makes you more open minded you ll meet new people something that surprised me about my getting laid journey was how much more open minded and less judgemental it made me i used to be very judgemental about girls about other cultures about other races i had all sorts of preconceived notions but through the process of meeting tonnes of women i met a bunch of people i never would have met otherwise people from all sorts of different backgrounds experiences cultures and countries the vast majority of them turned out to be absolutely amazing human beings and i found myself learning more about other people than i ever thought possible getting laid particularly if you try and keep an open mind naturally means you ll meet a lot of new people outside of your usual bubble people with different ideas opinions likes dislikes philosophies principles and values you ll meet people of different political leanings people whose entire life philosophy is different to yours people you used to instantly dismiss but now find yourself empathising with and understanding properly you ll become less binary less regimented and more open to new experiences and new people you realise a lot of your preconceived notions about certain people were complete bullshit falsehoods and assumptions fed to you usually by your parents or the media because pigeon holing people and writing them off before even meeting them is far easier than actually being objective and unbiased in your opinions you ll likely find yourself starting to seek out a more nuanced version of the truth not just with people but with most of the things you thought you knew after all most of what you think you know is complete and utter bullshit all of which makes you way way cooler to be around and opens you up to a future full of friendships with people you otherwise would have ignored or avoided getting laid makes you more open minded objective and rational getting laid helps you pick a better girlfriend when if you decide to settle down without a lot of sex and dating experience it s impossible to know what truly constitutes a great girlfriend if you haven t met and slept with that many girls you can t possibly be expected to know what qualities to look for what your deal breakers are what red flags to look out for what your boundaries are and when you should walk away vs when you should keep trying too many guys jump straight into a relationship far too soon with the first girl who shows them the tiniest bit of interest settling for far less than they deserve not only is that unfair on you but it s unfair on her can you really be a good boyfriend or husband if you re always wondering could i have done better in contrast guys who ve gotten laid a lot know what qualities they like in a girl they know what they re looking for and they know how to play the numbers game in order to find girls they truly want and when if they do settle down they ll be with a girl they chose to be with a girl who lives up to their standards a girl they can be proud to have on their arm a girl they respect getting laid gives you the tools and the confidence to find absolutely awesome women who ll truly make your life better amp x b getting laid makes you a better boyfriend partner husband and because you ll have met a lot of girls and had a lot of dating experience you yourself will be able to give more as a boyfriend husband partner you ll have had a lot more practice handling the ups and downs of a relationship you won t be so bothered by the little things and you ll understand and empathise with women a lot more you ll treat your girl like she s on your team instead of her being the other if you decide to get into a long term relationship or get married you won t have that nagging voice in your head saying am i missing out by settling down am i chaining myself you ll already have had your fill and you ll be able to commit to your woman without any thoughts of other women a tonne of guys end up in long term relationships when they haven t had much sexual experience settling down before they really feel ready to years later they have doubts and feel like they ve missed out they haven t explored their sexuality or really discovered what they re capable of in terms of getting laid i feel for those men and their girlfriends wives it s tempting to start feeling bitter and resentful towards your partner who did nothing to deserve it if i hadn t settled down with you i could be out there having lots of fun sex what a nightmare position for both people to be in i myself had a realisation that i m a better man when i m out there getting laid or know that i can get laid if i want to back in feb i posted this on the good looking loser forums it s a little crass i was young forgive me but it gets the point across i realised today i m a better man when i hit on chicks more importantly i m a better fuckbuddy boyfriend when i m talking to dating fucking lots of girls i feel so fucking happy and masculine and sure of myself when i hit on chicks a day like nothing in the world matters and i have my shit sorted everything else could fall apart and i wouldn t care when i m in a good mood like this i feel like i have so much happiness love to give i m nicer to my fuckbuddies i m not needy i m not clingy i don t lean on them for validation emotional support instead i can support them and make sure they re happy i feel like doing fun stuff with them like roadtrips i actually spend quality time with my fuckbuddies when i m hitting on lots of girls so i can t ever get complacent the last month with my fuckbuddy i ve been clingy and needy because i ve only been seeing her and i haven t really been approaching i relied on her too much for emotional support validation entertainment sex etc this is an important realisation and when if you do decide to settle down you won t have doubts about your girl you ll know she s the best or close to the best of all the women you ve ever been with you ll be confident you chose the best candidate for the position of your woman no doubts no uncertainties no mid life crisis where you fawn over what if john greenleaf whittier said it best for of all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these it might have been when you get laid a tonne and know you can get laid you ll be committed to the girls you want to commit to getting laid allows you to be more loyal if when you decide to commit amp x b getting laid gives you responsibility getting laid doesn t just give you responsibility it requires you to take responsibility for possibly the first time in your life you ll have to grab the reins and take control of your life and admit all your failures have been your fault not just bad luck you ll need to step up to the plate man up and decide you re going to start taking action to fix things getting laid requires you to grow up in a very big way over time you ll start naturally taking more responsibility towards the wellbeing of the girls you sleep with responsibility towards yourself and always being on a path of self improvement and self betterment responsibility towards your fellow man to give back and help him get laid too jordan peterson even goes so far as to say responsibility is the meaning of life and i happen to agree getting laid makes you a more responsible and mature man getting laid forces you to work through your insecurities like years of counselling all crammed into or years getting laid brings all your insecurities and things you ve been avoiding to the surface goodlookingloser said it best this process will strip you down and force you to confront your demons when you date a lot of girls all sorts of shit will come up do i deserve to get laid why am i such a loser other people are cooler than me i m not good enough to do this i ll never make it you might get depressed you ll likely break down and cry times during this process i did at times it ll be a battle i struggled with these insecurities and a billion more for years but as i got laid more and more i found myself naturally working through these insecurities facing them combating them and eventually conquering them it was a long hard process self improvement always is but it was the most incredibly rewarding thing i ve ever done there s a reason i put this one last on the list more than everything else on this page overcoming your mental barriers and becoming a more healthy person leads to the biggest most drastic changes of all the good news is if you want to get laid you won t have a choice in facing these insecurities you ll have to face them you ll need to run towards your fears that inevitability that oh shit i guess i have to face this if i want to get laid makes it a lot easier to tackle you really don t have a choice here whether you want to or not this process is going to drag you kicking and screaming through what ll often times feel like heavy duty counselling therapy and just like with good therapy you ll come out the other side a much happier more well rounded more resilient and able man you ll be ready to tackle the world ready to take on whatever challenges life throws at you ready to kick some fucking ass getting laid is years worth of counselling for free amp x b all of this is predicated on you not chasing meaningless sex meaningless sex sex with girls you re not that into and don t want to see again is fine a couple of times but can quickly become unsatisfying particularly as you gain more experience doing it a few times when you re desperate for more experience is probably par for the course but if you keep deliberately seeking out meaningless sex with girls you re not into it can quickly become shallow and feel empty there s a reason i don t encourage you to have too many one night stands for the most part you want to be building something with most of the girls you bang as i talked about in my retention guide and to be clear casual sex is fine most of the girls i sleep with are casual just aim to have sex with girls you re actually into and attracted to amp x b key takeaways i wrote this article for you to give yourself permission to go all in with getting laid yes you ll probably have to neglect your career for a couple of years yes you ll have to put aside your dreams of settling down yes you ll have to put aside a lot of things but it s more than worth it the alternative is spending your whole life knowing you can t really get laid and having a sense that none of your other achievements really matter because deep down you failed with women don t let yourself be a failure give this getting laid thing everything you have go all in play it with all you ve got and don t hold anything back not only will it be massively rewarding in itself but it ll also make you a better man in every possible facet of your life if you re still struggling to go all in and give yourself permission to get laid i get it it took me years to finally allow myself to focus on getting laid now go out there and get your dick wet andy
17702,intro one of my ec mentors here challenged me to go out and make cold approaches in days i decided to dip my feet in the shallow end of the pool and share with you guys how warm the water feels below are lessons i learned from the cold approaches i made so you can learn from my experiences and use that to spring board yourself ahead of the game only a fool learns from his own mistakes alone the wise man learns from the mistakes of others otto von bismarck body lesson number one i am god once you ve studied and lived out transcendent ideas long enough you begin to realize your vision of success is fully within reach you come to understand and appreciate your unlimited potential and know that all you want in life is possible coming to know this about yourself gives you an forever flowing fountain of confidence that you can tap into at any point in your life just by remembering if i am not there now i will be there because i am god and god has no limits faith in yourself is what gives you the power to move mountains in your life once you can combine your unlimited faith in yourself with constructive action towards your ultimate goals then you will achieve what many man can only dream of this is what the red pill calls becoming the prize when you approach a women from a position of lack one where you place her higher on a pedestal than yourself she will reflect your view of yourself and treat you as beneath her the inverse of this is also true when you hold yourself in such high esteem and fully understand you are capable of anything you will be admired by the people around you the women you meet will at the very least respect your confidence and love of self or at the very most beg to gag on your warm sticky unborn children for some people thinking of themselves as god may be too much or too egoistical this is acceptable because you have to find what works for you there is your way and there is my way as for the correct and right way it does not exist f nietzsche part of realizing godliness is identifying what are your truest desires and not what society or family or friends tried to convince you that you should want what kind of god lets his own life be influenced by the whims of others if anything it is god who influences the lives of others you know yourself better than anybody else and once you began that loving relationship with yourself you will learn that yourself and your instincts will never lead you astray trust yourself and your instincts how to implement lesson number one first you have to spend a good amount of time visualizing what you want your ideal life to be ignoring outside influences you must sit down with yourself by yourself and speak with yourself get to know yourself and figure out who you really are at your core some people see themselves as kings others see themselves as princes others call themselves sexy beasts whatever the x portion of i am x is identify it first from there you figure out all the things that x does then you live it you do those things and live it i am a man and the kind of man i am does xyz it really is that simple lesson number two never give unless you get we were near the food court when i saw a gorgeous girl with the fattest ass around town she was walking towards a table to sit at when she stopped to pick up someone else s litter and toss it in the garbage i couldn t stop myself from admiring her bodacious booty character and had to go say thank you on behalf of everybody hey i m normally the person who takes care of the trash problem in our town but you just made my job way fucking easier and i just wanted to say thank you for that i said as i stood over her at the table where she sat her eyes gave that kind of twinkle where you could tell she was smiling under the mask she leaned wayyy forward giving me a great sight of all her cleavage and that s when the flirting began in an interaction where i received nothing no interest no subtle queues i would have said my piece and kept walking in this case she did something i liked i thanked her for it and she kept on giving me more she opened up she smiled gave me a her full undivided attention and a glimpse at her big bonkers it s a psychological mechanism ingrained in our primate brains to serve and seek acceptance from those higher than ourselves you bypass this weak wiring when you view yourself as the most high believe it without a shred of doubt and can back it up through your actions only then will the outside world will fall in line understand that your time attention even affection are all rewards to be bestowed upon people who do things for you or that you like i would never let a girl i m having sex with treat our land as a public dumpster so by her already acting like a girl i m fucking i gave her the act of an appreciative man beta males give away time and attention for free without anything in return in hopes of being accepted by the higher status men and women in their life because they aren t comfortable with or accepting of themselves alpha males accept themselves and only reward those who serve him his goals and his vision how to implement lesson number two a prize of a man understands the concept of leverage and reciprocity in relationships when you re too giving or lenient in a relationship with women they will perceive you as lower on the smv totem pole than they are it doesn t matter if you are a genuinely giving person someone with a jesus christ like mindset because that relies upon the person your interacting with to have as much confidence and self love as you do and we all know most people in this world hate themselves imagine you own a store and a customer walks in and wants to buy a chair you offer to give them the chair at sale price to which the customer responds he wants a discount you give him the discount because you re rich and like helping poor people out well now this customer thinks you re a sucker respects you less and tells you to throw in another discount you continue to give because you re just a loving person oblivious to this potential customer turning into a parasitic value leach aiming to suck out as much as he can from you finally he tells you to throw in a free file cabinet with the chair the easiest way to solve this problem is by replicating the amount of effort you are receiving the customer wants a discount tell him sure after he fills out a minute survey about how great your store is and signs up for the store s news letter with women if she is being a bitch refusing submission or just being an all around unpleasant person to be around stop giving her your time attention and affection the only thing you should be giving a woman who gives you such treatment is the gift of your absence as for the situation with that one girl and her fantastically phat ass let s just say i ended up with blue balls which leads us to our third lesson lesson number three strike while the iron is hot emotions are wild rollercoasters that almost always come to steady safe and ultimately boring stops unless you step back on for another ride that is attraction works in the same way this is why it s commonly accepted that ltrs are red pill dating on hard mode because you must always be on your game versus being on your game for the hour or two that you spend with a plate when you re initially courting a women there is a finite chunk of time where she will be subliminally begging for you to show your balls and make your move on her this is the peak of that roller coaster right before all the loud screams and crazy twists and screws happen thankfully women emotions and attraction are like roller coasters they are constantly flying all over the place until they come to the steady and safe stop don t make the same mistake i made with this girl i enjoyed that flirtatious ride and played with kino sexualizing basically everything except asking her out on a date as the conversation continued i noticed her leaning back her enthusiastic responses deteriorating into one word murmurs when i saw her cover up the cleavage she was gladly displaying for me upon my initial approach i realized i had fucked up i took too long to make my move how to implement lesson number three you need to study what iois are and practice recognizing them in person if you don t even know what ioi stands for we have a fucking problem go read the side bar once you ve learned the theoreticals of iois it s time to go into the field and practice recognizing them start small if you have to and go people watch anywhere public look at couples or any men to women interactions and try to spot when the women is giving iois to the guy the next step is for you to muster up the courage to hit the front line and spot them in your own interactions with women i can t hold your hand for this one but by this point you will already know you are god or whatever and will have learned how to trust your own instincts when you feel like it s time to make the move and ask her out you re probably right if you feel like you waited too long and her attraction has faded you re also probably right but now remember how i said women their emotions and their attraction to us men is a wild ride like a roller coaster you do great those rides come to an end sure but they also start right back up again let s talk about hopping back on that ride lesson number four always be closing abc to paraphrase our good ol boy pook is your ultimate goal with women to discuss philosophy with them or to have them bouncing on your dick maybe it s both but i d bet my fucking life savings no honest man here wants the former choice without the latter accept you are a sexual being and understand that your goal with women is to have crazy hot and awesome sex with them once you accept this frame of mind you can utilize your mind to lead your interactions with women into that direction a k a always be closing are you going to spend hours chit chatting with a potential business client about random trivialities or are you gonna weave in products of yours that your selling for him to buy into the conversation this is common sense now what happens when you re encountering some resistance shit tests yet the client stays in your office that only means he is considering doing business with you but just wants to be sure that you are the real deal it s exactly the same way with women when they re throwing shit tests your way yet they stay in the conversation with you perhaps with a smile on their face and you can just feel the vibe is playful then your job is to be a fucking solid rock of a man blow that shit test out of the water handle the concerns or objections and seal the deal you wouldn t give up at the first sign of resistance when dollars is on the line so why treat your sex life any different how you do one thing is how you do everything how to implement lesson number four there was this cute girl short and a nice ass i watched as a suave guy was chatting her up they were laughing even a little kino then he walked away and that was the end of it i laughed and thought to myself thanks my guy he already warmed and wettened up the pussy then just left her out to dry i went up and started talking to her and within half an hour of knowing each other she is texting me sexual fantasies she d like to carry out with me to always be closing simply means that when you re conversing with women always look for opportunities to escalate sexualize and seal the deal with a close sex when encountering resistance such as lmr or shit tests yet the woman continues staying in your presence understand that if you want to have sex close and seal the deal you have to pass the shit tests work through the lmr and continuously aim to close the deal if she isn t comfortable with kissing right now go back to holding hands and try to kiss minutes later now you re making out on the bed but she isn t comfortable with your hands down her pants that s fine go back to making out and start feeling her up minutes later eventually this leads to sex i ve seen both sides of this coin i ve been the guy who gave up at the first sign of resistance and missed out on some cute and easy pussy but i ve also been the guy who heard a girl say we re not having sex tonight i don t have sex on the first date and had some of the juiciest doggy style i ve ever had recognize the opportunities spot the timings and execute your pitch of the close if you encounter resistance step back and re evaluate then weave in other opportunities to close what happens when you can t spot any opportunity for a close c mon bro you really think i d leave you hanging now lesson number five create opportunities to close what e p i c men do not only am i a god i am also an e p i c man oh by the way i thought you d recognize my talent for creating acronyms from that classic post always d a r e never d e e r i m the same guy wrote that too dant what does being an e p i c man mean does that mean i am a supreme alpha male hahaha let s k i s s okay no homo all e p i c means is that whenever you want to initiate the seductive process with a women you must first e ngage the women you re trying to fuck this is your initial approach after that you must p robe your girl gauge how interested and attracted she is in you now you might have a women who wants to gargle on your balls yet she is with her friends but like i said e p i c men create opportunities to close and that s all in the i solation my friend you have to lead her to a private area where she can let her inhibitions go eliminate as many barriers to free sex as possible asd being one of them once you ve isolated the girl you can now go for the c lose get her phone number go on a date get her in your bed let one thing lead to another until you magically have sex how to implement lesson number five e ngage the woman you wanna fuck with an initial approach p robe this girl to gauge how attracted she is to you i solate the girl so she is most likely to agree to do the dirty deed with you and c lose on the deed by setting up a date that s all you gotta do man honestly the hardest part of being an e p i c man for me ties back to the roller coaster metaphor recognizing a woman s attraction level but after spending considerable time talking to girls then reflecting upon our interactions as i bathe in epsom salt i ve realized this timeless lesson that i ll re share with you now lesson number six if a woman likes you she will make her attraction known the opposite is also true we ve already covered the importance of iois so i ll just give you an example first let s start with a horrible example thankfully this never happened to me personally but i ve watched completely unattractive blob boys try to flirt with cute girls and get them into bed it ended in complete fucking disaster the girl at first would be cordial but dismiss him any normal person could recognize the girl was clearly uninterested in a sexual relationship with this guy but this blob boy was anything but a normal person he kept pushing insisting and being creepy until the girl stood up in the middle of the dining hall and yelled i am not interested in having sex with you please leave me alone and everyone stopped and just stared at the guy until he walked away in shame as an e p i c man it s also important when to recognize you re barking up the wrong tree when to cut your losses and move on to the next potential sexual partner that blob boy was not an e p i c man however the flip side is also true just like when a woman will make it abundantly clear that she is never going to have sex with you she will also make it blaringly obvious that she wants you to rearrange her body parts in exotic penetrative positions like picasso paintings i signed up for a membership at a new gym this one had a pool and i love swimming after my workout routine i went upstairs to lift weights and spotted a super sexy trainer girl giving advice to a new client of hers her ass is fucking fat round juicy holy shit anyways i walked by her and gazed into her eyes when she reciprocated my gaze i knew the game was on after i finished my workout i was heading out the door until i spotted her giving some kind of weird machine massage to some dude on a table i walked right up to her and said hey do you guys like do chiropractory here to or something this place has everything she was like haha what i pointed at the machine in her hand and said well it looks like you re giving a back massage ooooooh hahaha no this is just physical therapy you must be new here huh is this your first day the conversation continued as she gave me more information about the gym and i gave her laughs and positive energy the dude who was supposed to be getting the massage was glaring back at me stay in your lane fatass eventually i tried walking away to which the girl hastily almost desperately blurted out hey wait what s your name my name is dant i said as i tried walking away again and one more time she stopped me with her words oh well hey wait since you re new here you re entitled to free physical therapy treatment here it s part of all memberships let s set something up my name is xyz i ll be happy to work out any kinks you may have free huh oh sure perfect i smiled took her name number and we ve got a free physical therapy massage set up for next friday now i m sure you can imagine the fun we ll have as she released the built up tension from my body how to implement lesson number six when a woman is sexually uninterested in you then your presence will be an unfelt force in her life she won t care if you leave and quite actually would prefer it this is completely contrasted from women who are interested in you because they will do everything in their power to continue the conversation with you and almost won t let you walk away let s take the girl from my example she was there massaging a fat sweaty slob in complete silence then i showed up bringing the laughs flirty energy and positive vibes she was doing anything she could to keep the conversation going until she finally said here s an excuse to set something up so we can talk more in womaneese to me still i m sure some of you unconfident nay sayers are just dying to type out ahahaha dant you really think that trainer girl is into you she s just teasing you so you buy something from her she s just using her feminine charm to get something out of you hahaha you re right bro she s trying to get my seed out of me but hey there definitely are girls who are just flirty with you despite the fact that things will never go anywhere with them and that s okay because lesson number seven cock teases are good to practice flirting with every time you engage in flirting or courtship with a girl you re actually tryina bang then you re running the risk of missing out on the pussy because you weren t experience enough to know how to handle the obstacles baring your penis from her pussy with a cock tease you have infinite freedom to experiment with generating attraction passing shit tests sexualizing and escalating without really losing anything some women are taken but just enjoy getting attention from other men why squander that opportunity there is a way to win in every moment of your life you might not get pussy from a cock tease but dancing the dance with them keeps you on your toes and prepared to make the right moves when you have some real pussy in front of you and finally cock teases are good social proof i have a latin background portugal spain italy and brazil and we are a very flirtatious physical and affectionate people we like to flirt dance hug squeeze and kiss those we like and are around even if we aren t fucking them it s just our way when i roll up into a house party and have several of my attractive female friends or cock teases that i know run up to give me excited hugs and kisses my status sky rockets at that party and now the girls who actually want to have sex with me are infinitely more likely to seal the deal with me how to implement lesson number seven rather than becoming angry at a women for not having sex with you accept that she isn t interested and use your relationship to your advantage remain on good terms and keep flirting with her use her for social proof and game practice the same way she uses you for affection and attention that s it remember reciprocity if she stops flirting back with you then you stop giving her attention it s that simple so what happens if you can t control your anger or your frustration for being rejected from access to da poosi well then you will quickly learn the next lesson the hard way lesson number eight your vibe matters i m a beach boy i literally want to have peace feel the sunshine experience happiness and have awesomely hot beach sex beach babes who could hate on that you honestly have to be a fucking toxic hating ass scumbag to hate on my vibe bro but you know what i m also ready to handle your hating ass too and that s the vibe happy fun adventurous sexy but don t fuck with me if you re an angry hateful toxic man no girls are going to wanna be around you girls just wanna have fun if you re giving them negative feelings and i m not talking about dark triad manipulations i m talking about legit negative feelings like hating women then they re going to run away from you trip on a rock and land on my cock cus i just be vibing bro good vibes how to implement lesson eight be aware of the energy you re putting out because as god your energy is what affects the world around you i don t believe in the idea that my emotional state is out of my control thanks to an awesome reminder i got from karlmalone about how to activate my good vibes at a moments notice i ve since remembered how much power i have over myself people always ask me dant why are you always smiling bro are you just always happy are you just fucking crazy yes and yes there is so much to be happy for at the very root of it all i am energy i am alive anything else is a bonus with an unchangeable truth as the foundation for my happiness i can only logically become happier and happier as life goes on in addition to being able to control your emotional state you also have complete control over how your mind operates and what you do with the physical vessel known as your body if you cannot force your body to act you are weak if you cannot force your mind to think the way you want it to think you are even weaker your mind and body are the greatest tools you have as an e p i c man just to use an extreme example to illustrate my point when you are in complete control over yourself then you have no excuse to put out negative unattractive vibes but hey we all have our bad times that s okay what s important is to not let our weakness fester recognize when you re being a negative person putting out toxic and repulsive energy you ll be able to spot this because happy and attractive people will gravitate away from you as a man whenever you re feeling down you must suffer in silence work out your pain through your lifts work through your suffering with fights and struggles cry in private if you have to the kama sutra even suggests that orgasms release dysfunctional energy that is blocking the flow of positivity in your life so use the lessons i taught you to get some hot pussy and fat asses into your life so you can release all that bad energy just whatever you do put out good vibes and if you can t help but put out bad vibes do it when you re alone even your closest allies don t want to see you in your weakness they ll want to see you when you re ready to work through the pain and you ll be glad to have their help let s wrap this essay up with one more lesson i learned pertaining to da poosi lesson number nine it is better to act and bear the consequences than to ask for permission to act despite what the blue pill media wants you to believe nothing will dry out a woman s pussy faster than asking for her permission every step of the way when it comes to seduction can you imagine a hot chad asking a girl is it okay for me to hold you hand is it okay for me to kiss you here is it okay if we have sex now is it okay if i penetrate you now is it okay if i thrust again hahahahah a real alpha chad just does that shit man aristotle said when caught between boldness or cowardice you will reap more reward from life by erring on the side of bravery when i was a young kid i got invited to a party and wanted to take pictures of me with some girls together i went up to them and asked politely geez shucks gurls do you think it would be okay with you girls if we take a group picture together with me their faces contorted in confused disgust i pretended like nothing happened and went to find my friends i learned my lesson right then and there and when i was invited to my most recent group outing i already knew what to do ayoo baddie and bimbo c mere i took one of them in each arm yo brandon you got us with the pictures brah take that shit bro smile for the camera ladies you look so pretty if i asked permission for that picture i defiantly would have gotten rejected but because i just did what i felt like doing i reaped all the benefits of that situation how long are you going to live your life waiting for the permission of others how to implement lesson nine stop living your life waiting for others permission you are your own master and don t need permission from anybody to do what you want to do morals aside if you wanna throw morals into it so long as you aren t hurting anybody and are genuinely doing positive things and making others happy especially yourself go and fucking do whatever you wanna do you will gain more from life by being bold and brave than you will by being timid and cowardly followers ask leaders act conclusion lessons learned dant can t count he promised lessons yet there were only nine that is proof you shouldn t trust anything i say in fact it s the motivation you should use to go out and make your own approaches in days and report back with the lessons you learned from your approaches i also learned how important it is to have men on your team rooting for your victory and to have men by your side you can call upon when you need help guidance or a kick in the right direction to quote a former ec but present day friend of mine those who have your best interests at heart don t just want you to succeed they want your success to completely surpass theirs it is for that reason i am thankful for this community for those who hear the call of conquest and want to rule themselves amp their world i invite you to join our journey of self mastery at my website
17741,sup fellas i ve shared my transformation story on here in the past how i overcame depression amp daily suicidal thoughts lost weight left a shitty relationship found trp amp other self improvement sites eg gll rational male bold amp determined roosh a few others started hitting the gym started hitting on chicks and went on to get my sex life in order amp have somes and other cool shit what i haven t shared is my history of depression and how i overcame it and reprogrammed my brain into being more of an optimist i was suicidal for about or years life was absolutely miserable i developed agoraphobia i couldn t leave the house i had zero friends i hated the world and most of all i fucking hated myself things got so bad i eventually made a promise to myself if i can just make it to my th birthday i m allowed to kill myself then i wrote out the full story of my depression the full thing is massive like words an hour and a half in audio form i ll copy paste as much of it as i can here but it ll be cut off by the word limit so i ll link to the rest of the article at the end of the post if you re depressed yourself i also have a list of resources that may help you here including books a couple other articles i ve written podcasts etc but the tl dr at least for me was writing a to do list every single day and ticking things off it even if they were the most pathetically meaningless tasks even when i really didn t want to i felt like my life was literally falling apart reaching out to others was also extremely important for me nobody overcomes depression on their own on that note i d encourage you guys to post on this sub if you re struggling with depression i know it s the last thing you feel like doing i avoided reaching out to anyone for almost a decade because i didn t want to be a burden but this is a self improvement community the guys on here like helping other people we re all literally here to push each other i know you may feel like a burden but the guys here want to help you helping others makes us feel good you re denying people the opportunity to help you if you keep it to yourself and you re denying yourself the chance to get the help you need so please reach out to us or a friend a counsellor just someone don t keep that shit inside now on with my story i ll post it below chapter despair i suppose i should start somewhere at the beginning this isn t going to be a complete autobiography of my entire life but rather a few key moments in time that explain how amp why i got to a point where i felt so damn hopeless and done with life i might jump forwards and backwards in time as i write this it might be messy in parts but so is life itself we ll start with my early high school days i had a pretty good childhood loving parents some decent friends hobbies i enjoyed for a while i was bullied at school from time to time but nothing i couldn t handle at some point i learned to stand up for myself and when a few of the bullies saw me fight back the bullying stopped entirely things weren t bad nothing was really wrong and yet i wasn t happy i m not sure when i first realised i wasn t ok with being at school maybe sometime around age i hated school hated it the subjects didn t interest me or challenge me the teachers were clueless amp mostly uninterested save for or of them homework felt like torture and punishment and i felt like i was stuck in a prison for hours and hours a day with people i didn t like and wouldn t choose to be with if i had the choice i knew i d be allowed to leave when i was but that seemed like an eternity away and i wasn t sure i d ever make it i felt trapped i used to have nightmares about school on an almost daily basis nightmares about forgetting to do homework nightmares about teachers yelling at me nightmares about getting into fights nightmares about not being cool enough to fit in nightmares about being stuck in school forever and never graduating nightmares about never getting to make my own choices or do the things i wanted to do or spend my time how i wanted to spend it i think this quote sums up my feelings about the mandatory education system gt there is nothing on earth intended for innocent people so horrible as a school george bernard shaw i could go on about my hatred and disdain for school i spent years going through the motions as many of us do at that age making friends really just people i spent time with to pass the time i cut off every single high school friend i d made within a year of leaving school doing the bare minimum rote learning against my will in order to pass trying to get through the mind numbingly dull lessons desperately hoping i could keep my sanity intact until i was allowed to leave on the surface i seemed ok and my parents and family were none the wiser i seemed like your typical teenage boy but i knew something wasn t ok i knew i wasn t meant to be caged in school like that i knew it was fucked up i was just too young to have a choice too na ve to understand myself and too inexperienced to know my one strongest value and guiding principle is i always have to have my freedom i need to be free this is something i realised many years later and it explains why i was so damn miserable during my childhood years i felt like my life was controlled mostly by the school system i was a passenger in my own life a prisoner who had to do as he was told and that s not something i deal with very well years later i found an old diary i d written when i was a diary i d completely forgotten about in it i talked about how empty i felt how lonely i felt and i mused about whether or not i was depressed looking back i obviously was disillusioned with the whole education system the fact i was locked up there with no way to leave even at the time i knew depression was the right word for how i felt and depression is the word i d written in that diary as the years went on i felt more and more isolated from my fellow students too i was really well liked in fact i was pretty damn popular mostly due to making silly jokes and being a bit of a smartass in class to make all the other kids laugh that was my way of fitting in being the class clown became a shield a shell a way to protect myself from ever having to be vulnerable a mask i could put on to make people laugh and smile so they never actually asked me how do you really feel are you actually ok so people liked me but i didn t feel cool i can t explain why i just never felt like i fit in like i wasn t part of the in crowd an outsider to the tribe someone who didn t belong so i d turn down invitations to hangout with people instead staying at home playing video games or teaching myself to program or taking apart my entire pc cleaning it learning how it all worked putting it back together again i d turn down party invitations too i never went to a single party throughout all of high school or university in fact i ve still never been to a proper party in my entire life i later realised it s just not my thing but the more i turned down invitations the more of a hermit i became my parents concerned for my welfare even started pointing out to me that i wasn t doing much socialising anymore but i was able to lie well enough and tell them i was happy and they had nothing to worry about my parents were actually brilliant in all of this they d constantly encourage me to go to parties and hang out with my friends they warned me that saying no to everything would mean eventually people would just stop inviting me to things my dad took me to play tennis with a bunch of people each week which was at least some socialising but i was too shit scared to really talk to anyone there eventually the other kids just stopped inviting me to stuff that hurt of course i don t blame them you can only invite someone to hangout with you so many times before it starts to hurt you every time they keep saying no but even though it was my own doing it still hurt at some point i discovered pornography too though back in those days porn was pretty damn primitive anyone who was alive back then will tell you the internet was not what it is today we were on k dialup internet later k wow it d take several minutes to download a tiny low resolution picture and video pornography didn t even exist back then but those images were enough to hook my young teenage mind and i found myself looking at more and more porn finding creative ways to get around my parents snooping through my internet history by the time i was i was absolutely addicted to pornography to the point where it was seriously interfering with the rest of my life and my happiness in general i also started playing more and more video games and started shutting myself in my room more i d come home from school and look at porn for hours until my parents got home then play video games until i went to bed needless to say with how much i hated school my lack of real social interaction my spiralling porn and video game addiction and my general depression and feeling of something is wrong i feel trapped my mental health started to take a dive my parents staged an intervention well multiple interventions they forced my to get an after school job pushed me to leave the house and hangout with other kids my age and limited my access to video games and the internet at one point my dad even took my computer out of my room and put it in the living room so they could monitor my access all of that helped a little but i was still depressed and now it was almost worse because i couldn t just hide in my room and play video games and watch porn to escape from the shitty feelings now i didn t have my self medication tools to at least distract me temporarily looking back i m not sure why i was so against socialising with the other kids it s probably just that i didn t really like any of them and didn t really click with any of them but one thing i do know is the more anti social i became the bigger a problem it grew into again my parents tried to help and pointed out many times that it wasn t healthy for me to have basically no friends well i had friends at school but i didn t hang out with anyone outside of school it became a vicious cycle because i wasn t hanging out with other kids i felt like a weird freak i became the loner which made me feel like maybe i wasn t good enough to hangout with any of them i started thinking they were all out there living the coolest lives ever while i was stuck at home being a loser yes that was entirely my own doing and to this day i m not entirely sure why i started being such a loner maybe i just felt like i was the only one in school who felt like school was prison torture nowadays i know plenty of people felt like that but i didn t know that at the time i felt like everyone else was coping with school but to me it was absolute hell on earth i felt like the outsider right from the beginning after a while the loner thing became my identity and i felt hopeless and helpless like there was no way for me to fix it i d become a loner and i d always be one it felt like me vs the world and not in a good way it felt like everybody was against me or didn t notice me or had forgotten me entirely i spent more and more time just being by myself and since i didn t like myself and didn t like my own company that was a tortured existence to say the least i must admit there were some positive side effects of my self inflicted solitude i got pretty decent at photoshop a skill i still use to this day and taught myself how to program code i wrote a lot of weird little software projects and made a tonne of flash games remember flash i learned how computers worked learned how to navigate the ever growing internet taught myself how to do my own research and discover new interests and learn more oh how i loved gaining knowledge i m so blessed to have grown up with the burgeoning internet of course the internet also made porn far more accessible to me and other young boys looking to self medicate and escape their lives for me it started out the way it does with most teenage boys i d look at pretty innocent pictures of pretty women secretly wishing they could be my girlfriend over time i needed more and more hardcore stuff like a drug addiction that kept escalating until i was at a point where only the filthiest most degrading porn would make me feel anything it got to such a bad point that i was spending hours and hours a day looking at porn and by the time i was i was looking at porn for sometimes upwards of hours a day but i m getting ahead of myself throughout all my childhood my mother was absolutely wonderful and always there for me but my dad no so much don t get me wrong i learned a lot about stoicism amp masculinity from him but more through observation at a distance rather than any life lessons he wanted to give me or wisdom he wanted to impart in fact the best way to describe how my dad raised me is he didn t some fathers are abusive some fathers are wonderful some fathers are deadbeats some fathers are absent my father was just kinda there he barely ever talked to me and any time he did it was no more than a sentence or two with my sister and my mother he d do far more talking but with me i felt like he just couldn t be bothered like i was a burden a hassle something in the way like the task of being a father to me teaching me to be a man wasn t his to fulfil i felt like i had to figure out most things entirely on my own how to deal with bullies how to talk to girls how to shave oh how i fucked that one up the first times i tried shaving i didn t even know you needed shaving cream or to wet your face first i scrapped and cut the shit out of my face for months until finally my mother noticed my scratched up face and taught me how to do it properly something a father should have taught a son for sure dealing with my emotions and my hormones was also something that would have benefited from some fatherly wisdom my father has never been great at expressing himself i call him emotionally autistic at the best of times any emotions either in himself or expressed by someone else cause him to shut down and go silent as if he can t handle them i learned how to deal with my emotions through my mother s teachings but she s only one person and what i really wanted was for my dad to teach me as well i needed to be taught how to be a man having to figure it all out for myself absolutely made me feel like the universe didn t really give a shit about my welfare like i wasn t important like i didn t matter i can remember asking him quite literally hundreds of times to throw a ball with me and play catch or play tennis with me or take me fishing or take me to the hardware store with him or just hangout with me and bond a little of the time he d make an excuse like i m tired from work or another time i promise and of course another time usually meant several more months of begging pleading nagging feeling like a burden every now and then he d relent and take me to the hardware store with him and even a couple of times fishing those were some of the highlights of my life and even to this day i have incredibly fond memories of those times but we re talking once every months and for a young man who already feels lost and disillusioned with his life longing for just a little bit of attention from his father once every to months is not enough looking back i know my father loved me and our relationship is a little better now not perfect in fact far from great but i know he loves me now and that s all i ever wanted there s many reasons why he was so ambivalent in his parenting the biggest of which is he was terrified he was going to be a bad father like he thought his father had been to him funnily enough causing a self fulfilling prophecy that ensured the very thing he was terrified of was exactly what ended up happening loser s mindset and all of that i ve long since moved past it and forgiven him but man as a teenager and in most of my s it absolutely ate away at my soul feeling like your father doesn t give a shit about you is rough and i empathise with everyone who went through something similar by the time i came out of high school i was well and truly bitter jaded miserable and kinda fucked up i had no social skills after neglecting them for years i was lost unsure what i was supposed to do with my life with a really bad porn addiction a bad video game addiction and no hope for my future i had literally zero friends i d dropped most of them shortly after leaving school not having much of a plan i did what everybody kept telling me i should do i went to university what a mistake more of the same it felt like i was still trapped being forced to study for exams and work on assignments and learn things i didn t really want to learn i made no friends at university hated every semester and as time went on and my depression spiralled i stopped going to class i ended up taking a year off and then when i came back i still couldn t force myself to go to class and was eventually suspended until i could get my shit together they were pretty nice about it even offered me counselling which i of course turned down i wasn t ready to admit to anyone not even myself that i needed help during those university years from about age to or life got worse way worse i had a girlfriend i lived with but it was not a pretty relationship it started out normal enough we d met during high school and liked each other well enough she was my first and i was hers on paper it sounded like a sweet story but my mind was all sorts of fucked up and i was not in a place to be dating anyone she wasn t much better a lot of that was my fault and the two of us were a match made in hell as the relationship went on we d fight more and more small arguments and disagreements at first but over time it turned into full on abuse that is the right word for it we were abusive to each other sometimes violent rarely empathetic she d say the most evil malicious fucked up things a human being could ever say to another human being and i d try to one up her by saying something even worse each day was a competition to see what creative insults and evil shit we could come up with things like you re nothing without me nobody else will ever love you because you re pathetic you re stuck with me and i hate you you don t deserve someone who loves you two people trying desperately to ruin the other person before that person ruins them until one of us was reduced to tears enough to leave the room leaving the other one the victor i m not proud of that time in my life and i m sure she wouldn t be either looking back we clearly both hated ourselves more than we hated each other so we used one another as punching bags for all our pent up self hatred rage and vitriol we were miserable together but we stayed because the alternative seemed worse being truly alone we were in an enmeshed relationship neither of us knew how to get out of by this stage i was deeply suicidal too and would have suicidal thoughts multiple times a day she d of course use that against me often telling me to do it and that i was a pussy for not being man enough to end my life like i was always saying i wanted to i started to idealise the thought of suicide knowing it d be an end to all my misery and suffering i d get the knife out of the kitchen drawer and hold it to my wrists often in front of her in the middle of a fight willing myself to do it as she egged me on but i never could i d be crossing the road and i d see a big truck or bus coming towards me and i d think to myself if i just close my eyes and stop right here this could all be over i researched different ways of ending my life from pills they often just kill your liver leaving you in agony for the last couple weeks before you die from it to slitting my wrists i was terrified of the pain to jumping off a building i d heard horror stories of people who survive the fall only to be a vegetable for the rest of their lives i wanted out but i couldn t find a way that didn t also involve pain i was terrified of being alive but i was also terrified of the pain of death i went through years of feeling like this years of daily suicidal ideations years of misery suffering torturing myself and her and her giving back every bit as good as she got years of pain and the good times became less and less frequent the happy memories fading into the background the more fights we had until there was nothing good left just suffering i made myself a promise i will be dead by the time i turn that became my mantra i d repeat it every time i had a dark moment or a bad fight with my girlfriend any time life wasn t worth living which was most days now in a weird way it gave me comfort and resilience all i had to do was keep toughing this pain out and if i could make it to i was allowed to die it gave me hope oddly enough death at would bring an end to all my suffering i started looking forward to hitting because it meant i could die looking back i can see now the only reason i picked was because i was so terrified of having to go through with it that i picked an age that seemed unfathomably far away funny now as i sit here writing this i m almost by putting it off until i hit i didn t have to keep wrestling with wanting to kill myself vs being terrified of the pain i could worry about that when i was i d cross that bridge when i came to it after all that was almost a decade away so the awful relationship continued with both of us doing our best to hurt each other seemingly as often and as deeply as we could i ended up cheating on her countless times with girls i wasn t even attracted to and didn t actually want to sleep with obese equally unhappy girls i met on craigslist or in chatrooms after weeks months of talking to them by this stage my own health had taken a nose dive and i was pretty chubby too with no style or dress sense no grooming and a lot of days i wouldn t even shower each time i d cheat on my girlfriend i d feel like an absolute evil piece of shit breaking down and crying often in front of the girls themselves i d swear to myself that i d never do it again and for months i wouldn t only to repeat the cycle again and the lying oh how the lying tore me up having to hide my cheating from the person i claimed to love claimed to care about absolutely destroyed my psyche having to look her in the eyes and pretend i wasn t going behind her back was horrible there s a reason i always advocate honesty something unspeakable happens to your soul when you tell a lie over and over and over again it s dark but with the relationship being so horrible and miserable and my life being a complete trainwreck i d inevitably want to go back to finding some escape and the thrill of sex with someone else the thrill of cheating on someone as fucked up as it is was an escape from my miserable existence even if that escape was always short lived and always just brought more pain i knew at the time it was fucked up vile evil totally against who i am as a human being and the values i hold but i was in too much self pitying pain and anguish to care when you re deep in nihilism and feeling sorry for yourself convinced that nothing matters it s very easy to justify hurting someone else my girlfriend caught me once or twice reading text messages on my phone and confronting me i d always downplay it and pretend it was just fantasy not reality but of course she wasn t dumb she just had low self esteem and would yell at me for a day but then just kinda forget about it and the cycle would go on it was about as toxic a relationship as you could ever imagine two people chasing the bottom of the barrel and dragging each other down every step of the way each day was a new chance to see how much lower we could go how much darker we could become stare into the abyss for long enough and eventually the abyss stares back at you i could keep talking about my toxic relationship for ages we were together for about or years in total there s a lot of darkness to cover there but if i did this story would be the length of novels i don t think there s much to gain from us spending the next paragraphs exploring the depths of human suffering and misery needless to say the relationship was the most pain inflicting thing two people could ever do to each other and no matter how many words i write about it i ll always fall short in explaining how tragic a time it was i also missed my family my girlfriend and i had moved over km away from both our families i especially missed my mother terribly so i felt lost without her she had always there for me and phone calls are never going to be the same as a hug in person i even missed my father for all his flaws i still loved him to bits i still missed being around him compounded with the fact i didn t have friends i felt incredibly lonely to cope with things i turned to something i d never actually tried alcohol i had my first drink sometime in my early s even though i d always told myself and anyone who would listen i ll never drink in my entire life i ve seen how drunk people act i m better than that but when faced with the pain of a mutually abusive relationship no friends no hope daily suicidal thoughts no direction in life and a deep seated self hatred alcohol sure looks inviting it started out slowly a beer here a glass of wine there i liked the way it made me feel and just like porn video games tv and cheating i liked the way it distracted me in the moment from the rest of my life sure every time it wore off i came crashing back down to reality but by this stage i was spending most of my time hiding from reality anyway and alcohol was another great tool in the fight against self awareness it helped me avoid having to admit to and fix my problems i splashed out and bought a few different expensive liquors and over the next few months added more and more to my collection i bought a cocktail recipe book and told my girlfriend i was learning to make cocktails and at first that s what i did i learned about recipes and actually got pretty damn good at it i could do shaker tricks i knew what swizzle sticks were i knew that setting an orange peel on fire gives a different flavour to just putting it in raw i knew how to make simple syrup i could measure shots by eyeball and i knew all the different names for all the different types of glasses for the first time in a long time i had a hobby i was kinda passionate about but of course when you make cocktails someone inevitably ends up drinking them and that someone was always going to be me you know where this story is going the cocktail making was a nice convenient rationalisation for my drinking habits i started getting drunk daily and then multiple times a day and then i was basically drunk all the time and drunk people don t make healthy rational decisions i looked at more porn i cheated on my girlfriend more the fights got even more fucked up i spiralled deeper and deeper into darker and darker recesses of my mind i had a job throughout all this a job i was actually fairly decent at and paid ok but it was becoming harder and harder to keep my alcoholism and mental problems out of the workplace eventually i quit because i knew i was going to have a breakdown once i no longer had a job things really went downhill i did nothing but look at porn watch anime and tv shows and sleep my sleep schedule was totally fucked my head was a mess but i didn t care my porn use at this time got worse and worse often it was to hours a day to the point where my dick wasn t even hard anymore i couldn t get it up sometimes i d still keep trying to jerk my soft dick pathetically and desperately attempting to keep it going so i didn t have to go back to my horrible shit life wanting any distraction from my own self pity and misery looking back it s obvious i had a huge porn and sex addiction i later got counselling for it and went to a sex addict s anonymous help group all the sex i had back then with random girls i found on craigslist and forums was very self destructive an addiction i threw myself into just to distract myself from the pain and self hatred even if it was always short lived the deeper into misery and depression i got the more i lost my grip on reality and lost my attachment to the outside world i became a recluse who d never go outside at this point surviving solely on the savings i d put aside over the last couple years at my job but that money was only going to last for so many months and as the numbers in my bank account kept counting down i found myself feeling like a complete breakdown was on the horizon i started avoiding reality entirely barely going outside ordering food delivered to the house or getting my girlfriend to bring food home she enabled me not really being all that concerned with how little i was going outside it got so bad that towards the end i couldn t even go outside to check the mailbox she had to come with me and whenever i did force myself to go outside it was absolutely horrific i was a paranoid wreck years of self hatred meant i was utterly convinced i was a terrible human being that everyone was secretly judging i d look around scanning everybody s faces to see if anyone was looking at me thinking i was a piece of shit if someone even looked in my general direction i d take that as proof they were all secretly looking at me secretly hating me secretly knowing how shit a human being i was i d so internalised this idea that i was a horrible excuse for a human being that i just assumed it was the objective truth i didn t even see it as low self esteem more like i was just being honest and correct in my evaluation of myself as a worthless piece of shit perhaps even less than worthless because i also felt like a burden to anyone and everyone who ever had to come in contact with me surely they d all be able to see that just by looking at me eventually i just stopped going outside that s all i can post without maxing out the word limit so read the rest here and again if you re struggling reach out to someone a friend a family member a counsellor or even post on here the guys on trp will absolutely have your back and will help you get through it but don t do it alone andy
17829,this is a continuation of my red pill analysis the page research paper by susan cook greuter we are now getting into the post conventional stages this is what susan has to say about the post conventional stages at the first postconventional level adults come to realize that the meaning of things depends on one s relative position in regard to them that is on one s personal perspective and interpretation of them although the objects themselves are seen as permanent their meaning is seen as contextdependent variables are now seen as interdependent causality experienced as cyclical and boundaries of objects as open and flexible koplowitz it always depends on one s definition of what is to be considered within a system or and what is outside this view of reality is called the systems view because it allows individuals to look and compare whole systems of thought or organizations with increasing distance postconventional adults can become aware of their own unexamined beliefs interest in laying bare one s underlying assumptions as well as those of the society is an important new capacity at these two new stages so what we have next is the individualist pluralist stage these guys are people who can see things from a fourth person perspective these are the guys that realize that things are no what they seem to be these are guys who are explorers challenge rationality and scientific assumptions using more subjectivity in their reasoning all the while allowing for others opinions to enter in guys here do not disregard the beliefs of others and sees everyone s point of view as valid personally i believe that i am currently at this stage when men can get to this stage it a big deal as it is a signal major shift from conventional to post conventional thinking once you become a post conventional thinker you are able to be more a big picture kind of guy guys who can see things from a fourth person perspective focus on understand why they believe what they believe they question unexamined ideas that society does not support this kind of thinking is welcome in a college but with your family friends and at work highly unlikely at this stage individualists can see that groups and societies see it as their duty to change and mold the minds of others guys here can finally see how their world view has been heavily influenced by their environment how they were raised and overall social conditioning this is when a red piller gets past all the rage and sleeping around and can now look inwards to understand himself he begins to understand that we have less control over who we are than we would like to believe guys here tend to like to travel around the world because now they see that one s life view is not the only possible life view to be had individualists and pluralists have now discovered how subjective their views are and how what a lot of what appears to be objective is actually more subjective they liberate themselves for cultures and become more comfortable with confusion individualists and pluralists get deep into meditation to understand themselves perhaps they even do psychedelics not just for fun but to have a spiritual experience they get into yoga as well they get away from being a pure rational man and make way for a more holistic way of going about things bringing their feelings how their body feels and context they go from purely thinking logically to a more psycho logical approach rather than wanting to explain everything rationally they are more into the process and experience the journey to reach the goal is more important to them than the goal itself to quote susan when one fully realizes that most prior meaning making was socially and culturally conditioned scientific certainty and the judgmental frame of mind break down moreover individualists can learn to consciously scrutinize their beliefs in order to test their assumptions or to relish the novel mental freedom such a maneuver opens up a big discovery for this stage is the relativity of points of view when people first become aware of this they may see everything as relative and reject any prior certainties including scientific knowledge as absolute and therefore false it takes experience at this stage to realize that successful living likely requires some of the earlier values most individuals need to make a living to survive sticking with a job one may not totally like and getting along with others who do not appreciate constant questioning is thus a requirement for most adults no matter how creative and postconventional one may be at this stage guys here recognize how easy it is for your feelings to fool themselves how easy it is to fall into self deception they understand their own vulnerabilities i mentioned how guys here realize that things are not what they see to be what happens here is that they begin to look to make more connections instead of a logical point of view these guys are okay with contradictions and paradoxes life is more exciting individualist are more for the experience rather than trying to analyze everything they become more present to the moment they become more existential they want to make a unique personal contribution to world and not have to adhere to what society says a good example of this is howard roark from the fountainhead this is where some of the work of being in the post conventional stages come in you have to figure out what your unique purpose is guys here pull back from living in the external world and working in a company or just from their mundane daily routines they decide to focus their attention inwards and to answer their own burning questions these guys march to the beat of their own drum and make good writers artists and entrepreneurs the extreme case of an individualist is focusing too much on their internal world this can lead to frustration and getting even more confused as more questions will arise the deeper one goes down the rabbit hole guys here feel as though they have many sub personalities or an inner tribe they can see the different aspects of who they are to quote susan instead of the imagined greater integration and harmony the th person perspective and experience may feel like a cacophony rather than a symphony depression at this level has several facets a the realistic fear of being reabsorbed that is sucked back into the rat race of the achiever mindset by the demands of society b the dread of a routine work life that does rarely allows for individual self expression and creativity c the concern that one will never find a clear self definition from which to consistently operate and generate a coherent self sense d the deep experience of worry and tensions that come from growing beyond the conventional mindset especially when it comes to intimate relationships the experience of looking at the world with different eyes than those that used to be one s closest allies such as a spouse or a long term friend can create great distress for both parties while the conventional partner is confused about the new way of behaving of the person with the th person perspective those who are postconventional feel misunderstood and un appreciated for what they now feel they have to offer the latter also often wish for the significant other to become more like themselves this in turn can make the person left behind feel disrespected and misunderstood in this sense the move of one partner from conventional to postconventional meaning making poses a particular challenge to couples and long term relationships unlike later stages early postconventional individuals cannot yet fully appreciate the gifts of the earlier levels they genuinely feel that if only others including their loved ones would become more like themselves then everybody would be happier and the whole world would be better place guys more on the pluralists side are more opened minded they desire to respect and understand all positions the differences that others have are celebrated these guys because of being able to see things from all sides and appreciate others and their point of view can be very dynamic socially basically they can empathize with others a lot more easily than the earlier stages can guys here are usually admired by both women and men for doing their own thing being indifferent having a unique style self expression being spontaneous and living their life the way that they want to live it i have often had women who i have dated or even just met be in awe of how i act and how i live my life women have called me balanced high in social intelligence and an inspiration all the same guys here can be seen as unpredictable and wild cards and people have seen me like that with an acting teacher once lovingly calling me a wild man up next is the strategist this is the stage that i am working on getting myself more into perhaps of me is there this is where that fourth person point of view is more world centric previous stages may have world centric views as well but guys here thinking more globally and embody that more this is when a man is now on his way to becoming a high value man guys here can see how everything is interconnected how their own means to making meaning is interconnected they have expanded social networks and a bigger time frame they are autonomous and perceive systematic patterns and trends these autonomous guys and spots different parts of themselves at different times where the individualists are prone to depression strategist are more able to integrate this stage is called autonomous because guys here can now make meaning independent of conventional ideas a major leap is the ability to create your own story where the previous stage has a hard time with integrating all the parts of themselves this stage feels empowered to do so strategists embrace self realization and sees the limits to their power and how it is apart of what it means to be alive these are the men who are for civil rights and race equality their expanded awareness allows for them to have more information they are both excited by big ideals and yet have a more realistic approach to being able to break down old patterns in groups and societies they realize that they must be the best that they can be in order to be effective they want to be able to help others these are the strategic executives and leaders that see people as capital and not as a means to an end when i think of this in real life i think of someone like joe gibbs they develop people for the individuals sakes and for the growth of society at large the downside to this is that guys here can get frustrated with other people s unwillingness to grow and change their wanting to change other is a big flaw of theirs they see life an open ended journey a choose your own adventure they feel free to do whatever they want with their lives they are effective leaders being able to make strategic decisions they seeing complexity as just apart of the deal guys at this stage also enjoy their privacy they need alone time time to reflect they love to watch things unfold whereas the achievers want to be the best that they can be to quote susan the strategist s eyes good company good questions intimate relationships and a meaningful occupation as well as chances for self actualization and self fulfillment are essential for a meaningful existence others are valued as ongoing vital co actors in one s own fascinating life drama autonomous persons become fine tuned to their own psychological well being and inner workings they take responsibility for regulating their thoughts feelings and behavior they are responsive and adjust when required as part of different life contexts and career phases deeper life purpose and legacy issues become an important topics of concern how does my life and my contribution matter beyond my life time and my immediate realm of influence sometimes at this stage guys can gain a sense of superiority a bit of of a my shit don t stink kind of attitude though they can accept others more easily and see others as complex human beings overall they are very tolerant of others their relationship to their emotional is powerful they have a wider range of emotions they use strong emotions as indicators of what they should do next in life strategists do feel down if they feel as though they are not living up to their unique human potential they can feel a loss of courage and a loss of sense of self which further complicates things they will takes the responsibility for their relationships as well as autonomy for being alone now we have the the postautonomous stages the final two steps to quote susan these two advanced stages represent qualitatively new ways of seeing reality and experiencing life and the self they replace loevinger s vague integrated stage i e her theory of identity formation describes an ever more clearly defined and delineated self identity she held a view of ego integration that could not conceive of the possibility of the transcendence of both self boundaries and the need for a permanent self identity cognitively the last differentiation represents cross paradigmatic capacity operations any further differentiation within the same paradigm of increasing hierarchical complexity is reaching is manifest limits only the creation of a new way of knowing can hierarchically supersede and integrate all previous knowledge and ways of knowing in the symbol mediated personal world of meaning making the two postautonomous stages are called construct aware or ego aware and unitive respectively now people come to realize that all objects are human made constructs including for instance such abstract constructs as purpose linear time and the ego all are based on layers upon layers of symbolic abstraction even such an everyday concept as a bed is an enormous simplification no two people s mental picture of a bed is alike and no two beds in the world are identical and yet we all use the term bed and it works well for most purposes of communication to become cognizant of the pitfalls of the language habit as well as its tremendous gift to humanity is a unique feature of the the most advanced ego stages let s start with the magician the alchemist these guys here are on a whole new level they are beyond their own lives they can understand other cultures better and an appreciate different ways of living they are deep complex thinkers very existential they concern themselves with matters of the head heart and the meaning of language they accept paradox and ambiguity they are committed to serving others with humility they understand the non dual nature of reality at this th person perspective everything is put into question they are stepping back and observing what meaning is from an even higher perspective you can almost call this the deconstruction stage as everything is broken down there are two parts of this stage the construct aware and the ego aware however most people are more ego aware than they are construct aware construct awareness means that the guys here understand that everything is constructed from meaning events to concepts all the same these are the guys that will be those hip new and cool scientists that you will never hear about who are making brand new theories then you have guys going even deeper and deconstructing meaning making itself the dark side of this is that that when you create your own multi dimensional maps this can be the ego s way of gaining more control some guys here may begin to realize how futile all this map making is this lead to even greater suffering as you are diving in so deep but are left with no ways to transcend them ego aware people are just that more aware of their ego they understand themselves better as well as the need to create framework and stories they see that the ego is there as a central functioning unit and as a central point for self identity formation to quote susan once human beings realize the fundamental function of the ego to create a sense of permanence and saliency they may experience their full and inevitable ego centricity as long as one operates in the rational language mediated realm there is no escape from this insight having an ego which craves clear boundaries and significance and unceasingly tries to create them is now often felt as a constraint to further growth and understanding when the ego becomes transparent to itself it may well desire ego transcendence but the very attachment to detachment creates the paradoxical situation of exacerbating the attachment the more one tries to move beyond with greater effort the more one gets stuck noticing and experiencing such existential dilemmas is common at this stage unlike the more cognitively oriented people with the th person perspective ego aware individuals focus more on the ego s clever and vigilant machinations at self preservation by creating the illusion of a permanent self identity final knowledge about the self or anything else is seen as illusive and unattainable through effort and reason because all conscious thought all cognition is recognized as constructed and therefore split off from the underlying cohesive non dual territory even such a concept as ego or feelings become now questionable what is the ego other than a term we have created in order to explore and communicate a kind of experience in the west that is shared and utterly human to what degree is this concept necessary and useful and in which way is it reifying experience to a degree that prevents us from fully being alive and open to experience without linguistic filters by turning further inward ego aware persons start to see through their own attempts at meaning making they become aware of the profound splits and paradoxes inherent in discursive thought in many ways they individually rediscover the korzybski s notion that the map is not the territory only this time this realization is not just an interesting piece of received knowledge it constitutes a vital and often temporarily painful aspect of consciousness in essence ego aware people have a deeper understanding of human nature and human interactions they pay attention to their own emotional reason and rationalizing they notice how fleeting thoughts and feelings are they come to see that part of us that judges ourselves as a barrier to self acceptance and the ability to embrace others they have greater access to intuition bodily states feelings dreams archetypal and other transpersonal material increases even more than that these places become just as important sources of knowledge as rational places these guys are more spontaneous and are more in a state of being the knower and known become merged think of leonardo dicaprio he is a great example of someone who is at this stage as an actor what makes his so great is how spontaneous he is when you look at him in films like django unchained when he was bleeding for real and went with it that scene on the sales floor in wolf of wall street or even in the revenant he is in a state of being he is a huge advocate for the environment and has spoken about how he has a spiritual relationship with nature guys here are looking to get rid of the conditional self they notice more than ever the parade of thoughts their sensitivity goes up i mentioned dicaprio but guys in this stage make for great actors as well as great musicians and athletes if not that they become catalyst for change within their organizations or even leave to start their own companies that will create change they resent the self importance and self knowing that may strategists exhibit to quote blaire pascal man is nothing compared to infinity and an infinity compared to nothingness another issue at this stage is that guys may become overly self critical but they do have mature defenses and their emotions can be spontaneously expressed these are men that are much more free with revealing their emotions vulnerabilities and confusions last but certainly not least is the rare unitive men here are rare and experience human life in a whole new way they see through the song and dance of life they are witnesses rather than observers rather than seeing through self they can see through a universal and cosmic point of view these people become legends think leonardo davinci george washington carver nikola tesla albert einstein hayao miyazaki and men like that once again to quote susan unitive individuals experience themselves and others as part of ongoing humanity embedded in the creative ground fulfilling the destiny of evolution the two sides of the pascalian paradox are integrated feelings of belongingness and feelings of one s separateness and uniqueness are experienced without undue tension they are simply changing perceptions of the unending possibilities of being at this level of integration adults can look at themselves and at other beings in terms of the passing of ages of near and far in geographical social cultural historical intellectual and developmental dimensions they can take multiple points of view and shift focus effortlessly among many states of awareness they feel embedded in nature birth growth and death joy and pain are seen as natural occurrences patterns of change in the flux of time consciousness or rational awareness is no longer perceived as a shackle but as just another phenomenon that assumes foreground or background status depending on one s momentary attention persons at the unitive stage can see a world in a grain of sand that is they can perceive the concrete limited and temporal aspects of an entity simultaneously with its eternal and symbolic meaning because of this unitive ability maslow p they can cherish the humanness in the seemingly most undifferentiated beings and feel at one with them they respect the essence in others and therefore do not need them to be different than they are it is important to realize that from a unitive point of view later stages are not better than earlier ones because all are necessary parts of interconnected reality and the overall evolutionary process unitive thinkers also accept themselves as the nine stages of increasing embrace in is in a non controlling way no matter how great their achievements may be they are aware that these are only a drop in the pool of ongoing human endeavors sensitive others are often struck by the humility and grace that they experience in the presence of unitive individuals being down to earth simplicity on the other side of complexity can be one of the most salient differences between postconventional ego stages and transpersonal ways of meaning making though people at this stage may be seen as aloof and not into goals and pursuits particularly from the perspective of self they may seem ungrounded though in reality the guys at this stage are catalysts for others lives being changed inner conflicts are just apart of being they are no longer driven by their desires to achieve one thing or to get into a different state they are able to let go and rest in being they are concerned with global justice spontaneity existence amp creativity but create no undue tension around goal achievement do not confuse this with being passive they are simply non attached their impersonal approach allows for them to have a more direct approach when taking action they are just not attached to outcomes reality is now experienced as undifferentiated phenomenological continuum or the creative ground of unified consciousness everything is seen as something that has been constructed from thoughts feelings sensations and even theory because they understand the human condition so well guys at this stage feel interconnected with all sentient beings they can shift their focus effortlessly they see time as non linear they see doing and thinking as parts of being alive but not more valuable than feeling or non being to quote susan one last time to summarize unitive adults are more likely to have a balanced integrated sense of both their belongingness and separateness as individuals because they feel part of the ongoing evolution of the universe in all its aspects and cycles of creation destruction and recreation i hope this helps and hope y all enjoy
18021,how to be dominant and challenging a lot of people like to say women like assholes that s not exactly correct women do not like assholes an asshole is a guy who is mean to a woman for no reason women don t like that instead women like men who are dominant and challenging being dominant and challenging are not exactly the same thing you can theoretically be dominant without being challenging if your dominance is predictable and easy to access but dominance and challenge are interrelated in many ways as we shall see dominance simply means that she follows your orders and you do not follow her orders period dominance is only a question of who gives the orders you can have more money than her be smarter taller etc but she is still dominant if she successfully gives you orders more than you give her orders being challenging means she should never feel like she has easy access to your giving your attention time emotions favors etc she should always feel like she needs to do more or overcome some obstacle before she finally conquers you which you should never let happen because you are perpetually challenging she should always feel like your acceptance of her is maybe she should feel like you will not accept her if she does nothing meaningful for you and you only might accept her if she does meaningful things for you but your attention and acceptance are never guaranteed for any of this shit to work you must be attractive women are attracted to dominant and challenging men only if inhabit the transcendent frame which means your life is awesome and your thoughts and emotions are constantly focused on a reality that is fundamentally superior to hers in almost every way and preferably unattainable by her except through you any guy can bark out orders and ignore her but women only put up with that shit if there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow if you are unattractive and your emotional experience and frame sucks being dominant or challenging will not mean shit to her most guys naturally do this stuff when they do not care about a woman but these same guys often stop being dominant and challenging when they run into a woman they actually like and see as high value if you can learn the principles and rules underlying these concepts you can intentionally act challenging and dominant even when you are madly in love with her the practical actions to show yourself as dominant and challenging you must go out of your way to do at least some of the following actions women evolved to assume that all men are betas until proven otherwise so even if you are the most attractive alpha guy in the world you still must demonstrate that fact to her subconscious emotions otherwise she will assume you are beta therefore at some point in the interaction you must say no to her successfully give her orders that she follows giving orders is the most important part of dominance the more emotionally invested she is the more she will want to take orders from you if she really likes you she will go out of her way to do things for you even being asked but be careful if you press the gas on giving orders too quickly you may look douchey or overbearing you should also not get mad if she does not follow your orders just move on i recommend starting small can you hold my drink and then working your way up come stand over here so i can hear you better and then this bar is lame let s go to the one across the street until eventually you are telling her how to suck your dick impose a false time constraint which is a statement implying you may need to leave soon the false time constraint takes pressure off her because no matter how awesome you are there is always a fear in her head that you will never leave or stop pushing the false time constraint also makes her feel like you live in the transcendent frame and your time and attention for her is limited you should always impose a false time constraint when you first approach women or on first dates if the woman is having fun she will completely forget that you said you needed to go example early on in a date hey let s grab a drink and sit over here just to let you know i have to wake up early tomorrow so i have to leave at like put soft obstacles in her way a soft obstacle is when you do or say something that very very lightly implies you may not accept her the obstacle however must be something she feels like she can easily overcome if she feels like you are actually rejecting her she will feel scorned and run off to find somebody else examples you you re a pisces i m an aries you know aries and pisces are not compatible right you you re only i m i am way too old for you no woman is going to run home and cry into their pillow because you said your signs don t match or you are too old for her instead it will motivate her to overcome this small bump in the road to get you and if a small obstacle doesn t excite and motivate her to get you she was not into you anyway the soft obstacle is the easiest way to inject a challenge into any interaction you can just take anything she says or does and make it a reason why things may not work out if we are talking about foods we like and she says i hate cheesecake i might act fake shocked and say you hate cheesecake it might not work out with us sometimes i get up and pretend i am leaving the date respond with maybe her do you like me you so far so good but we will see what happens her we should hang out sometime you sure i am busy this week but i might be able to do next week i will let you know again you must say maybe with emotional intelligence in a way that fits the context how you say maybe with your long term girlfriend will be fundamentally different than the girl whose number you just got in the club tease her teasing is making fun of her in a joking way that makes her not feel rejected example i can t stop laughing at how you kept pushing the door when it said pull or your spanish was amazing when you ordered that taco implement the alpha male quid pro quo which means you should do less for her than she does for you and you should never do anything for her until she does something for you first i have written about this at length elsewhere act unpredictably acting unpredictably does not mean to act erratic or strange it means you are constantly elevating so your actions and reactions today may will be different than what they previously were because you are now a different person maintain and enforce your boundaries a boundary is a rule she must follow so it is both dominance and a challenge disagree with her randomly withdraw your attention use double meanings which is a phrase that has meanings one sexual intimate and one not double meanings are important because they induce the idea of maybe did he mean to say that he wanted to fuck me or did he not she will never know example when you are charging her phone for her hey i am having trouble plugging in the charger can you help me find your hole when you do this shit it is crucial she not actually feel rejected women are extremely sensitive to rejection because in the caveman days if a woman was rejected by the tribe she would probably die or get raped because she would be unable to fend for herself if a woman feels rejected or like rejection is imminent she will run away and find another guy even if that guy is worse than you you must use emotional intelligence to ensure the challenge is fun and appropriate to the situation you should not look like an emotionally distant asshole who is intentionally playing games but rather a fun mysterious guy who is not quite sure about her yet autistic idiots read lists like this and try to tease women by calling them stupid bitches don t be a moron although there are some women that would probably think it is hilarious to be called a stupid bitch your specific jokes challenges and orders should vary depending on the context of your relationship if she is deeply emotionally invested and committed to you the challenge you create is much different than if you just met a bitchy model at a nightclub nevertheless you cannot use the uniqueness of your woman or situation as an excuse to not do this shit all women want a challenge you just need to tailor it for your audience you should also adjust the level of the challenge depending on the context of the relationship if you have been acting needy and overly interested you may need to correct it by acting challenging and creating some soft obstacles for her on the other hand if you have been acting too challenging and she has been feeling rejected you may need to tone down the challenges i cannot tell you what to do in every situation i can just give you the general principles as you can probably tell many of these behaviors have been traditionally called being an asshole therefore even though it is deadly serious and non negotiable that you do these things you should try to do them in a joking lighthearted way for example when i tell a woman our signs are not compatible i have a giant grin on my face and my arm around her when a woman asks to see my paintings i put my hand on the small of her back and whisper softly in her ear i m not ready to show you yet remember this is all a bullshit game you put on her for her subconscious emotions you do not want her actually feel rejected or give her conscious mind something to object to that said if she does not allow you to do these things she does not comply with your orders she keeps expecting you to follow her orders etc you may need to use the nuclear option which is to leave pressing the nuclear button is very difficult for many guys because they do not want to lose the woman but it is better to leave and never see her again rather than be the beta in the relationship the best way to do the nuclear option is to appeal to the transcendent frame which is that you have a better reality available to you so you do not have to deal with her bullshit for example if she is being difficult you can leave while saying something like hey i m sorry my friend just texted me i have to go meet up with him you should not make her think you are leaving because you are butthurt but because you just some have something better body language in addition to doing the stuff described above you must have the right tone of voice demeanor and body language the thoughts and emotions of a dominant and challenging man are focused on the transcendent frame which means he lives in his own world a world that is fundamentally higher than the world of people around him the transcendent frame is a fictional place where everything is better such that you would never want to leave and enter her frame to a man in the transcendent frame regular people s desires and problems are boring and meaningless which is why nothing perturbs him the transcendent frame means you essentially have access to heaven and she is invited but she must do some work to get there first to see an example of a man in the transcendent frame watch an interview with a celebrity where it is clear they do not want to be there the celebrity is trying their hardest to be nice and give answers but you can tell they would rather be doing something else like fuck a ton of bitches at an awesome hollywood party the interviewer on the other hand is trying their hardest to keep the interview interesting and engaging and you can occasionally see the celebrity light up when the interviewer asks an interesting or good question that is how women should feel your thoughts and emotions are fundamentally somewhere higher but if she meaningfully contributes to your emotional experience she can grab your attention for a little bit the higher your standards for where you point your attention the more the woman will be attracted to you because she eventually wants to enter your reality and live your celebrity life as a practical matter your demeanor must have three modes disinterested neutral and interested your neutral state is cool calm and collected like nothing can anger you or perturb your emotional state in your neutral state you are almost in a state of nothingness like spiritual gurus encourage you to achieve when interested however you are enthusiastic excited and joyful because somebody hopefully her has done something worth paying attention to and getting excited about in your disinterested state you withdraw your thoughts and emotions because she is being shitty boring or not interested in you the psychology dominance the psychology behind dominance is simple humans evolved to subconsciously view social relationships as a dominance hierarchy and women are most attracted to men above them in that hierarchy status in the hierarchy is associated with dominance people with status give orders to people below them and take orders from people above them if she feels like she can you give you orders and you will comply her subconscious mind will classify you as beneath her and lose attraction to determine if you are dominant women have a strong subconscious urge to test your dominance by giving you orders to see if you follow them these tests often called shit tests can be in the form of a direct demand for action buy me a drink a hypothetical demand for action i only sleep with men who take me to fancy restaurants a demand you change your opinion i can t believe you don t think we should believe all rape accusers or generally acting dramatic or upset and hoping you respond by kowtowing to her either verbally or otherwise i have ptsd so you have to accept that i get triggered and freak out when you do or say certain things the counterintuitive thing about these tests however is that women subconsciously want you to refuse to comply with their demand you just have to disregard her demand in a way that is warm loving nice and not butthurt because these demands are the irrational vomit of her subconscious mind she will totally forget about them when she is gripped by a stronger emotion which is the dominance of the alpha male all of the demands in this paragraph were actually made on me by different women and i still fucked them all without complying womens dominance tests are often very subtle and you must be very careful to notice and pass them womens desire to test your dominance will grab onto any real world fact it can use to justify itself which means sometimes womens dominance tests are stupid and can be easily ignored but sometimes they may make rational sense if you are sitting closer to the remote it makes sense that you would grab the remote instead of her in these situations you should appeal to the transcendent frame she should feel like you are inherently above doing petty things even if it would be easier for you to do them than her of course sometimes you need to do things for women a healthy relationship requires reciprocity and if you never do anything for her she will think you are a selfish asshole and she will be right to stay dominant over a long term you must generally cultivate an attitude that you give the orders and you will only do things for her only after and in response to her doing something for you and to make sure there is no confusion you should always do less for her than she does for her most men fail dominance tests because they have no idea there is a power struggle going on they just think that if they comply with the woman they will make her happy not realizing that the very act of compliance makes the woman lose attraction to them challenge you must be a challenge for three reasons humans evolved to feel most emotionally engaged and excited when they are overcoming a challenge on the way to an attractive prize you subconsciously create the frame that she is chasing you instead of vice versa and it takes pressure off her the neurochemical associated with pleasurable things like food drugs and sex is dopamine but contrary to what most people think your brain releases most of the dopamine on the way to the pleasurable thing not after you get it as artie lange the famous comedian and coke addict once said the best part of doing cocaine is the drive to your dealer s house to get it this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective your brain uses dopamine to motivate you to go get the pleasurable thing it doesn t care as much whether you enjoy the pleasurable thing once you have received it humans are most excited and meaningfully engaged when the goal is attractive they venture into the unknown to get it they defeat challenges on the way especially other people and they share the prize with others therefore to get women most excited you must be attractive be mysterious so that she is not quite sure how awesome the prize is be a little challenging and allow her to show you off to her friends the moment the challenge is over and she has gotten you the part of her brain that wants a challenge will switch off and she will subconsciously start looking for another challenge even if you are the most amazing guy in the world ideally she should always feel like she needs to do a little more work to get you furthermore when the prize lies in the unknown and is not completely clear and attainable it often looks a lot bigger and more attractive than it really is for a challenge to be most engaging it must have the right level of difficulty like a good video game if the challenge is too easy she will get bored and look for a harder challenge if the challenge is too difficult she will give up and find a guy who is easier to get it is your responsibility as the man and the leader of the interaction to constantly ensure that the challenge is just the right difficulty which means you may need to make it easier or harder depending on the context and her reaction being challenging also makes her subconscious mind think that she is chasing you rather than you chasing her it may sound stupid to say that you can trick a woman who wasn t chasing you into thinking she was chasing you by acting like a challenge but that is how human psychology works our subconscious mind constantly looks at all available data to understand the social dynamic and if she sees you lightly push her away it might think to itself i guess i was chasing him and he was too good for me well now i have to get him human psychology is weird sometimes women say things to be a challenge i don t know if i should date you you live too far away or our signs are incompatible etc women normally do this because even though they feel attraction they are feeling a little smothered by you and want to create emotional distance you should respond by agreeing and amplifying saying things like yeah i do live too far away in fact my real house is on mars and it s quite a commute or yeah our signs are totally incompatible we would kill each other if we were dating by agreeing and amplifying not only are you winning the dominance aspect of the shit test but you are subtly turning the challenge around on her and making her look like the needy one and you as the challenge being challenging also takes pressure off her women evolved to assume all men are needy beta and desperate so by creating some distance between you and her you give her breathing room if she feels like you are totally emotionally invested and will stop at nothing to get her she will feel a ton of pressure which will make her want to flee instead women should feel like interacting with you is a choose your own adventure game and she can get off at any time by simply not pursuing you again this distance need not be huge our signs are not compatible is fine you just want her to feel like you are not on top of her when she thinks of you instead of thinking that guy is obsessed with me she should think i think that guy might like me but i am not sure men by the way like a challenge too when you see a hot blonde with a beautiful face and amazing body at the bar part of what excites you is the fact she is a challenge if you knew you could fuck her whenever you wanted you would feel less excited i have seen tons of high value guys who had a line of women they could fuck whenever they want but their thoughts and emotions were fixated on the one woman who did not give a fuck about them even if that woman was less attractive cool fun etc than the they already had this shit is wired into us this is stupid if you are reading this and thinking this shit is fucking stupid you are correct all this dominance and challenge stuff is an irrational residue of our caveman biology it makes almost no rational sense it only exists in peoples subconscious emotions and it leads to a ton of unhappiness because it causes both men and women to pass on people that are great for them and instead chase shitheads who are dominant and challenging womens desire for dominance is irrational hierarchies can and should exist in the real world and they are often based on real merit but her emotions are easily tricked tons of losers drug dealers and pimps successfully trick women into thinking they are dominant even though they cannot get a job at a target a man can be rich famous good looking and awesome at everything but if a homeless woman regularly orders him around she will subconsciously feel above him in the social hierarchy even though in reality she is not above him in any way whatsoever plenty of high value men become bitched out by low value women because they fail dominance tests the social hierarchy in her mind is simply guided by who gives orders and who takes orders that s it similarly desiring a person who is a challenge is completely irrational in the real world people either like you or they do not and somebody who is a challenge probably does not give a fuck about you and you should move on also we are all alone in this cruel universe so the idea that you have gotten somebody is stupid plenty of women have thought they got me only to be shocked when i moved onto somebody else once you realize womens desires are irrational and not rooted in reality it is easier to be dominant and challenging all you need to do is go down the list i gave earlier do each item at least once or twice and then you can go back to being yourself your attempts at being dominant and challenging do not need to make rational sense they just need to speak to her subconscious emotions i often say no to stupid shit that does not matter or make fun of her for shit that does not even make sense you do not have to actually be dominant or challenging you just need to feel like it on the flipside because these desires are completely irrational you can never let a woman know you are doing this shit on purpose as i said earlier women only let men be dominant and challenging because they live in a transcendent frame if she figures out you are doing this shit to manipulate her you will be dead in the water because her subconscious mind will realize you are faking it and there is no transcendent frame and her conscious mind probably is not going to appreciate you telling her you were trying to manipulate her many people would say something like i am too old to play games like this i agree this shit is corny stupid and petty that said you cannot deny the reality about human nature if humans were completely rational and transparent creatures we would not see of marriages end in divorce and so many relationships end in heartbreak and confusion and furthermore human nature does not suddenly change once you hit a certain age or phase in life i can assure you i have seen this shit work on lots of women in their s who were supposedly looking for a husband my website
18140,i ve heard a tonne of bullshit excuses from other guys as to why they can t get laid i got so sick of hearing the same shit that i collated some of them so i could just send people an article i ll list all the excuses here below here i also link to a tonne of videos articles evidence that goes along with everything i m saying let s go i can t get laid because i m short i m not tall if you still think being short is a total dealbreaker for girls it s not then fix it wear height increasing inserts shoes they re super cheap they add up to inches to your height so you can go from ft to ft no excuses or date shorter women there s plenty of them or grow a pair of fucking balls and date taller women you ll have to hit on far more of them than if you were tall but so what are you going to bitch and moan or be a man and deal with the cards you ve been given or the best solution of all stop whining about your imperfections and grow the fuck up none of us are perfect i m not perfect stop seeing your flaws as limitations and start seeing them as simply challenges for you to overcome if you still stuck on this excuse i link to an example in the article about a ft guy who gets laid more than you i can t get laid because i m asian i m indian i m not white shut the fuck up the population of china is over and a half billion people india has another and a half billion how did those people get here did they magically fall out of the sky or did they have sexual intercourse oh their indian asian parents had sex seems to fly in the face of i can t get laid because i m ethnic if you re asian or indian or insert some other ethnic group here just man up and go hit on as many women as humanly possible if some girls have a problem with your skin colour that s their preference they can date whomever they want move on immediately to the next girl and hit on her keep going until you find one who thinks you re a badass besides it s not your skin colour girls are put of by they re put off by the fact you re a raging pussy who complains about his skin colour the fact that you re weird about your ethnicity causes you to act timid weird around girls that s the turnoff you re embarrassed about your own skin colour and people can smell that self hatred a mile away saying i can t get laid because i m not white is an admission you re ashamed of yourself amp don t like being you nobody s going to be turned on by someone who doesn t like themselves self hatred is repellent if you stop seeing your ethnicity as a problem other people will be less inclined to see it as a problem asians and indians are stereotyped yes so don t play into those stereotypes asians are stereotyped as weak skinny submissive so be strong buff masculine indians are stereotyped as being weird around women creepy so don t be weird just have a normal conversation and ask for her number so you can grab a drink and the thing both of these races are stereotyped most for is being insecure about their race if you bitch about not having been born white or you whine about girls not liking you as much as white guys you are fitting that stereotype you are part of the problem stop reinforcing the very stereotype you re sitting here crying about you re stuck with your race so man up and be the best that your race has to offer go google hot asian guy yes it s fucking weird maybe get prepared for gay porn to get recommended to you based on your search history are you seriously going to tell me none of these asian dudes can ever get laid do the same for indian guys or whatever ethnicity you are that you ve told yourself can t get laid are you seriously going to tell me none of these guys can get laid some of those motherfuckers probably get laid more than me amp my coaching clients they certainly have the potential if they go out and talk to lots of girls i bet they don t sit around crying about their ethnicity like you do and if you think your accent is a turnoff for girls change it either embrace the fact you re a foreigner with an accent and stop being apologetic for the way you talk your insecurity is more of a turnoff than your accent or do something to change it hire a speech coach speech therapist many dudes have done this including my girlfriend s father he had a thick accent when he first moved to my country he realised the importance of sounding more like a local resident especially for business so he saw a speech coach and now he sounds like a local speaker you can do exactly the same thing stop looking for excuses and start looking for solutions i can t get laid because online dating is dead no it s fucking not here s proof what you really mean is tinder requires you to look good and have good pictures get your shit together and follow and improve yourself instead of bitching that you can t get laid when you look like shit if you really think tinder is dead go outside and talk to girls if you can t talk to girls do this an approach anxiety program like i did there s great free ones out there if you can t do that go to bars pubs with your friends and talk to some girls if you can t do that go to meetup com and socialise with people and meet women organically through that stop spouting nonsense like online dating is a waste of time when thousands of dudes are going out there getting pussy from tinder bumble etc as we speak i can t get laid because i m ugly improve your looks wear better clothes groom yourself properly lose weight so your face looks better gain muscle so you look buffer get tattoos piercings max out your looks and make the most of the hand you ve been dealt stop bitching start improving i can t get laid because i m really ugly do everything i just wrote above max out your looks and do the best with what i ve got then build a business become rich quit fucking whining and instead spend years working jobs and saving every dime until you can afford cosmetic surgery wear a suit all the time groom yourself immaculately wear expensive accessories go on seekingarrangements com and buy girls a drink in exchange for their love tunnel throw money at girls to sleep with you either ridiculously hot escorts or just buy girls expensive cocktails and dinners etc stop making pathetic little bitch excuses and start looking for solutions many girls don t give a fuck about looks as much as how much of a boss you are being a rich motherfucker makes you a badass boss being a little crybaby who whines i m uggggglyyyyyy doesn t i can t get laid because i m fat lose weight then fatty it s not rocket science consume less calories than you burn anyone can lose weight it doesn t even take much discipline i lost lbs kg while you re losing weight start talking to girls in person or on tinder you need as much practice as you can get i can t get laid because i m too old i ve heard this complaint a million times often from guys in their s which is fucking hilarious guys can get laid well into their s if they re willing to work on themselves and become complete badasses i ll bet a million dollars you aren t past your s yet so man up and get to work improve yourself be better i made a post the other week about this exact thing most of my mates are in their s and i ve talked to multiple guys in their s and s i was already by the time i even started improving myself by the time i figured out what i was doing age doesn t fucking matter don t make excuses don t be a little bitch literally any guy can overcome his obstacles if he really wants to if you say you re a special case who can never get laid especially if you say you re too old you are choosing to live a shitty life i can t get laid because i live in a small town there aren t many women around then move if you can t afford to move see i can t get laid because i have no money work or jobs if you have to i had to work jobs while i hustled to turn my coaching into a full time business save up enough money to move somewhere with more women quit bitching and start setting yourself up to be able to leave your small town as soon as humanly possible nobody is forcing you to live there you re choosing to stay i can t get laid because women are all feminists now no they re not i can count the number of actual feminists i ve met on one hand and as soon as i met them i was put off by their antisocial behaviour so i just walked away immediately and went and hit on another more well adjusted girl are you going to make excuses and let other people dictate whether or not you can get laid or are you going to man up and go after it stop intentionally seeking out anti feminist rants on youtube i wasted years watching that crap and just live your own life while you re there obsessing about feminists and leftists and progressives and whatever other crap you re outraged about the rest of us are out here swimming in pussy besides if you ever do happen to meet a feminist you know what you can do block her and move on quite a revelation i know but the block unmatch button exists for a reason if you meet a feminist while talking to girls in person you can immediately walk away you being outraged about feminism is no different to crazy sjws being outraged about toxic masculinity whatever other nonsense they get pissed about you re just as bad as the people you claim to hate move on and join the rest of us getting laid there s plenty of pussy for everyone i can t get laid because i m a virgin don t have much experience answer this question first do you actually want to lose your virginity some of my good friends were virgins all of them eventually got laid by manning up and putting in the hard work these guys who were virgins lost their virginity instead of crying about it yes it took effort yes it took time yes we had to work through a lot of mental hurdles and i had to convince them they deserved to get laid but all of them were man enough to plow through the hard times and then go on to plow through some girls or go try to have sex with any female friends you re into or ask your mates if they have any single friends they can introduce you to or go to meetup com and make friends with girls get to know them and one thing will lead to another or go to bars pubs at night have a few drinks so you re more confident and just do your best to say hi to at least girl a night you don t have to be great at it you can be clumsy and awkward all you have to do is keep trying every night hell pay a god damn prostitute plenty of guys i know have done this one of my mates lost his virginity to a prostitute and was bloody glad he did because he finally got to shed that awful i m a virgin label another guy on a forum i frequent was unhappy about being a virgin so i told him to go see a prostitute days later he did it and that shedding of the virgin label allowed him to then go on to go on something like dates over the next year and get laid or so times don t make the excuse of i m too good for a prostitute or that s beneath me either pay a prostitute or do one of the several options i just listed above there s so many options there you can t possibly keep making excuses either lose your virginity or quit crying about it if you choose to use your virginity as an excuse fine but you don t have the right to complain about it if you re not going to man up and make some changes like a big boy i can t get laid because i don t have money what a retarded excuse getting laid costs barely anything nobody s forcing you to buy girls drinks i don t pay for anything tell girls to meet you for a coffee ask the starbucks cashier for a cup of free water while your girl orders herself something else and there you go free date i ve done this so many times i ve lost count i used to be a tightass with money i was dirt poor and still got laid a tonne if you re going to complain but i need money to buy new clothes and accessories and other stuff you need to get laid then get a fucking job you crybaby get a second job if you need to i ve lost count of the number of hour days i ve worked and day weeks without a break quit whining man up do whatever it takes to get laid i can t get laid because i live at home don t have my own place move out if you can t afford to see the solution above get a job or a second job fool around with girls in public i ve banged girls in public in parks at night in the backseat of cars in public toilets in alleyways get creative stop complaining and start looking for solutions i can t get laid because i m too skinny have no muscle hit the gym i started out so pathetically skinny and weak i couldn t even do a single pushup now i can rack pull kg lbs even when i was a skinny bitch i was still getting laid quite a lot you know why because i refused to act like a victim and instead just hit on as many girls as humanly possibly making it my number mission i became obsessed with getting laid i shut my mouth and put in the work and was rewarded with plentiful pussy you can do the same go to the gym pay a strength coach get strong and big and sexy i can t get laid because i ve had bad experiences with women in the past haven t we all jesus i was in horrific abusive relationships for almost years total again are you going to let yourself be a victim are you going to let your past define you or are you going to man up and make something of yourself go see a counsellor talk to your mates about your past trauma talk to family members you trust post on a forum sub about what you ve been through there s plenty of other awesome forums out there i know it s scary having to put yourself back out there and risk rejection pain trauma again but that s nothing in comparison to how horrible you ll feel if you live the rest of your life in the shadows instead of facing and conquering your fears you ve got to run towards fear not away from it i can t get laid because i don t have the time piss off of all the excuses this is the most bullshit you have the time you re just scared get laid on tinder super efficiently i barely spend minutes a day on tinder or go outside and talk to one girl a day you don t even have to be good at it you don t have to be smooth just say hello to one girl ask for her phone number so you can grab a drink and go from there don t waste time texting keep conversations strictly to organising the date long conversations are a waste of your time have super short dates tell the girl you can only spare minutes for a quick drink invite her back to yours after the mins is up and try to bang her immediately if she doesn t want to have sex with you that night tell her that s cool and walk her back to her car train immediately so you re not wasting any time all of that should only take you max minutes a day either you want to get laid or you don t but don t invent ridiculous reasons like i don t have any time besides i bet you have time to watch netflix for hours a day after work you lazy prick you cannot possibly tell me you have literally minutes a day you can spend working on getting laid i used to be in a place where i would work for hours a day across jobs write for my website have a girlfriend go to the gym hang out with mates and i still have minutes a day i can spend hustling for pussy i can t get laid because i m depressed this one i empathise with i was depressed myself for many years it s fixable though if i can fix it and you sure as hell can too start with this book it changed my life you can t afford the luxury of a negative thought go see a counsellor it s an important first step talk to your family friends and tell them how you ve been feeling what s making you feel depressed post on a forum with guys who ll support you absorb as many self help books amp positive youtube vids and podcasts as you possibly can brainwash yourself with positivity even if you think it s pointless this is how i was able to overcome my own depression suicidal thoughts talking to people is the most important first step don t face depression alone it ll eat you up i can t get laid because i m autistic awkward weird don t stress so was i at the start my first approaches i was so weird i literally couldn t talk i was so overwhelmingly anxious nervous terrified and shitting myself that my mouth would go completely dry i d forget my own name literally happened twice couldn t talk and felt like i was about to throw up on the girl i used to have a mantra in my head don t throw up don t throw up don t throw up don t throw up you know the wildest thing despite how weird and fucked up i was during those first few hundred approaches i still got laid i got laid times in my first approaches despite feeling like the most hardcore captain autismo guy in the universe you don t have to be mister smooth or james bond to get laid it s ok if you suck in fact i insist on it getting laid doesn t require you to be amazing it just requires you to try a lot of the time you ll get laid just by asking for it besides you ll naturally become more comfortable more confident and less autistic weird the more girls you hit on confidence is just something that comes after you ve put in the work and sucked really badly for a while go out and suck for a while i bet you your weird ass can get laid if you re just willing to try i can t get laid because women suck i hate women women don t suck you just have a bad attitude towards them you ll get what you subconsciously desire you think women suck so you ll attract women that suck you re in a self fulfilling prophecy it s totally fine i hated women when i first started out i was combative angry bitter i treated them all like they were the enemy i ve talked about hating women being bitter towards them in the past the solution is to just try and keep an open mind and trust that you ll start to hate them a little less the more time you spend with them don t lie to yourself and say women suck i don t really want to bang them you do want to bang them or you wouldn t even be here reading this right now you do care about getting laid as much as you protest otherwise start slow try making friends with girls meetup com is a great place to start and try to deliberately search for the good in them because there are a tonne of good women out there it s up to you to go find them i can t get laid because i m shy nervous it s absolutely positively ok to be terrified at the start i certainly was i was so shy and nervous i could barely even remember my own name a lot of people are nervous at the start everybody has to start somewhere if you re really nervous and don t think you can talk to girls start with a free approach anxiety program like i mentioned earlier it s exactly how i overcame my shyness nerves at the end of the day you re going to be shy nervous when you first start this stuff that s unavoidable you have to just take a deep breath tell yourself it s ok if i suck at this and just give it a go don t let fear hold you back you re better than that i can t get laid because i don t know how to talk to women don t know what to say it literally doesn t matter what you say anything is better than you not even trying even if it s a little awkward a little weird and entirely un smooth just try anyway and quit being a little excuse making bitch in person just say hey i know this is a bit random but you re really cute and i just had to say hi i m your name then just talk for a minute or two it doesn t have to be longer than minute and then say hey lemme grab your number and we ll grab a drink or a coffee sometime if she says no thankyou cool move on and talk to the next girl on tinder bumble online dating in the article i link to templates i use you don t have to be good at this you don t have to be the perfect alpha just man up get in there and start talking to some girls sitting on the sidelines because you don t know what to say is a lame excuse and you fucking know it i can t get laid because i have a small penis stop complaining buy a penis pump and make it bigger i have one i recommend in my article besides good sex isn t even about having a big shlong it s about foreplay teasing playing with toys exploring your sexual bucketlist amp trying out a bunch of fun fantasies fetishes your dick doesn t even matter if you do everything else right i ve had plenty of nights where i did nothing but tease the girl and explore foreplay with her without even taking my underwear off i know your dick is a point of insecurity i get that you feel like less of a man i get that do your best to work with what you ve got practice your foreplay start exploring fetishes fantasies and make yourself a foreplay god of good sex is fucking a girl s mind not her body i can t get laid because i m too young i have a baby face i look young women don t take me seriously start taking yourself seriously a man doesn t make pathetic excuses like i look too young he deals with rejection ignores the girls who think he looks too young and goes out and hits on as many girls as possible until he finds one who doesn t think he looks too young stop making imaginary excuses and just deal with the fact all of us have our own flaws i started out suicidal fat bald pale amp ginger didn t stop me and just take action to get laid every guy has the potential to get laid a lot on tinder in person in bars on the street anywhere else yes i really do mean every guy even if you look too young or look like shit shit or have deformities are you going to let that hold you back or are you going to grow a pair of fucking balls and say fuck you universe you don t get to beat me i m going to show you and bust your ass doing whatever it takes to get some snatch dress older don t dress like a boy dress like a man grow facial hair if you can grow it gain muscle so you naturally look more masculine fight back instead of sitting around feeling defeated i can t get laid because i have a crush on this one girl and my crush is really meaningful and i don t want to ruin it quit being a giant raging pussy man up and make a fucking move on your crush do you think she d be proud of you if she found out you ve been hanging onto feelings but have been too cowardly to make a move you don t even know if she likes you hence you need to make a move and find out if she does awesome now you guys can date if she doesn t awesome now you can start hitting on more girls and find one who does like you the chemistry you think you have with your crush is just an invention in your head if you haven t actually made a move on her then you have no tangible proof she actually likes you your feelings are a fantasy they re not objective reality until the moment you actually ask her out and find out if there s something there or not i can t get laid because i don t want to objectify women then don t objectify them a core philosophy of mine is honesty and ethics adding to the lives of the girls we date and not just having meaningless hookups or using girls you can be polite super respectful and classy and still get laid sex and being good to women are not mutually exclusive if you think women don t want sex and trying to fuck them is objectifying then holy shit that s backwards i m being harsh maybe you just don t have a lot of experience with women amp you think they re not capable of impure thoughts but let s look at it more critically do you literally think it s your mission to tell women what they want don t want if a woman comes up to you and tells you she finds it really hot to be objectified plenty of women will happily tell you this if they think you re not going to judge them for it will you ride your chauvinist white horse and tell her she s wrong to want what she wants will you secretly think she s a slut whore if she wants to be objectified will you rationalise it as good women don t want to be objectified grow up man stop being so puritanical everyone loves sex women love sex a lot of women love being objectified or made to feel sexy many even love being used in the bedroom i can t get laid because i value my privacy easily fixable use tinder with the setting only show me to people i ve already liked turned on nobody will see your tinder unless you already like them meaning nobody has to know you re on tinder meet girls in bars away from your family friends whoever you re trying to hide your sex life from bang them at their place or in a hotel or in the backseat of a car etc i value my privacy really means i m not really all that serious about getting laid i can t get laid because girls might reject me yeah they might man up and do it anyway look i get that rejection doesn t feel nice i don t like being rejected nobody does but are you going to sit around like a pussy and give up just because there s a chance a girl might say no to you you re terrified of failing but you know what has a guaranteed rate of failure giving up so either choose to be a loser when it comes to your sex life or man up and take a chance and risk some possible rejection rejection is only temporary you just have to feel sad for a bit dust yourself off and try again with the next girl i can t get laid because it s too hard cue comments from people that won t listen to anything i ve written they ll say i don t get it because i m tall and white and inset excuse really is valid that the problem is really insurmountable pretty much every single item on this page can all be boiled down to getting laid is hard and i don t want to put in the effort yes getting laid is hard no excuses grow a pair of balls and give it a go nothing worth having ever comes easy do you really want to live a boring complacent life where you know you re suffering in abject misery you can improve yourself and start getting laid anyone can you just have to actually try and that s hard i know that i know it better than anyone i know it s hard to gain momentum at the start when you feel like such a loser but the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step focus on one small change you can make right now and start working on the things that are stopping you from getting laid i have absolutely zero respect for anyone who says i can t get laid because and then doesn t choose to overcome those hurdles you re focusing on your problems instead of looking for solutions you re choosing to be a loser i want nothing to do with you i can t help you because you ve already chosen to give up now it s a very different story if you acknowledge your shortcomings and then work around them i m short and that makes it fucking hard to get laid but i m going to work my ass off and hit on times as many women i respect the hell out of that you re focusing on solutions instead of bitching about your unluckiness luck has nothing to do with success it s not the complaining that s the problem we all complain including me it s the giving up success is literally inevitable if you just never quit but you re going to choose to fail by giving up you have one life you ve been given a gift just by being here and you re going to spit in the face of that precious gift and not even try you may as well lock yourself in your bedroom and get drunk amp play video games for the rest of your life because there isn t much point being alive if you re a quitter if you think the universe has dealt you a bad hand then fight back give it everything you ve got and be better andy
18286,hey guys here s my super in depth guide to fixing erectile dysfunction amp performance anxiety i know my mates have had problems talking to anyone about this a lot of guys do and it makes them crazy insecure i ve had my own issues in the past so i wanted to share my advice on the subject let s set the scene you re there in the bedroom a cute girl laying naked in front of you super horny and dripping wet ready to receive your man meat only your man meat rsvp s nope to your little party leaving you feeling limp lame lost and let down god fucking dammit fear not fellow penis owner uncle andy is here to help dick issues come in two forms your cock not being hard erectile dysfunction and the anxiety and worrying about not being able to get fully hard performance anxiety if you can get hard from porn jerking off by yourself but can t keep hard when you re with a girl then that s performance anxiety you re just nervous psyching yourself out sometimes even the thought of potentially getting ed can give you ed itself i m speaking from experience here i ve made more than my fair share of anxiety about ed and that s lead to me not being able to perform even recently as recent as a few weeks ago i ve psyched myself out by worrying about ed sometimes it s more crippling sometimes we build ed up into a big monster we re terrified of which gives us even more anxiety ed and before we know it we can t get hard with any girls it s frustrating as hell debilitating if you can t get an erection for a girl it feels like i want her but i can t give it to her she s right there but i can t have her but you have to realise having performance anxiety at some point is inevitable even after all the girls i ve had sex with every now and then i still sometimes get nervous maybe i haven t seen a new girl in a while so i feel rusty maybe this girl is crazy hot and i feel a bit of pressure to perform maybe i jerked off too much earlier in the day and i m worried my dick won t get fully hard maybe i m super tired and stressed from a long week of work and sex is the last thing i feel like doing sometimes my dick just doesn t work as well as i want it to if you ever have anxiety or erection issues it s not just you don t beat yourself up about it or think there s something wrong with you or think you re less of a man every man s had at least one moment where he couldn t get it up in the bedroom it s normal and if it makes you feel any better girls have their own insecurities and anxieties in the bedroom too at least of girls aren t able to orgasm all that easily in front of guys without a few toys and a lot of concentration relaxation and a lot of them feel very insecure about it girls also tend to be very insecure about their bodies ask every girl you sleep with is there anything you don t like about your body and she ll give you a long list of things she s insecure about they re insecure about their ability to please you sounds like the performance anxitey a lot of guys have insecure about if you ll think she s pretty insecure about her tits the majority of girls aren t happy with their body even more so for hot girls they re some of the most insecure so while you re stressing about your ability to perform for her remind yourself she s stressing about her ability to perform for you when you re nervous remember she s just as nervous as you are maybe even more so enough theory let s not waste any time sitting around analysing your ed figuring out why you re having problems or if you re doing something wrong or if there s something wrong with you etc fuck that shit let s jump straight into improving this right fucking now go through all the solutions below trying each one one by one i promise at least one of the solutions on this list will improve your anxiety ed you ll get even better results if you combine multiple solutions from the list these are all solutions i ve figured out myself in my past struggles with ed all of these solutions work i haven t included anything i haven t personally tried and verified myself on my site i only ever talk about things i have experience with i ll make your dick hard i promise solution give yourself permission to not have sex absolutely the best solution on this list and one i came up with myself because i m a fucking genius i ve used it many times when i ve been nervous anxious about sex particularly with a new chick you tell yourself she and i are not going to have sex tonight i m not even going to let her touch my dick it s off the table we ll do everything else kissing touching i ll finger her and go down on her but she s not touching my dick because it s probably not going to be hard let s go one step further i forbid you from using your penis your dick must stay away from the action no matter what no handjobs no blowjobs and especially no sex that ll take all the pressure off because there ll be literally no pressure to perform sex is off the table so who gives a shit if you can t get a boner you won t be needing it tonight you can even keep your pants or underpants on if it makes you more comfortable which is fun in itself there s something really fun about the girl being completely naked and you still being half dressed it s also a fun fantasy for a lot of women it puts you in the position of power where you can have fun teasing her and making her feel good but she doesn t get to have you yet keeping your dick out of it will also give you a great opportunity to explore other aspects of sex and get a bit of practice with foreplay amp teasing there s a million things you can do to have fun with a girl that doesn t involve your dick make out and tease each other for as long as you can last touching and caressing every part of her body except for her clit before she finally begs you to finger her play with her clit go down on her and eat her out many chicks enjoy being eaten out as much as sex itself play with vibrators i highly recommend a magic wand read my guide on giving girls mindblowing orgasms finger her and learn where her g spot is and how to make her squirt tease her body for ages bringing her close to orgasm then backing off at the last second leaving her begging for more do this again and again for minutes and she ll rant and rave about you to all her friends give her a massage tell her to masturbate for you while you watch without touching yourself she and you will both find this incredibly erotic it s really fucking hot watching a girl masturbate for you while you just sit and watch her gently encouraging her and telling her how sexy she looks especially if you re there with your underwear pants still on while she s exposing herself to you cuddle her and just hangout talking or watching a movie gently playing with her tits or her body while you do grab something to use as a blindfold use a scarf or a piece of clothing tie her wrists together above her head with another scarf or tie then grab some ice cubes from the freezer and spend some time gently moving them over her body asking her how it feels hang out and talk about sexual fantasies get a piece of paper and write a sexual bucketlist together for you to explore later roll her over so she s lying on her stomach then spend some time spanking her ass with one hand while you rub her pussy with the other kiss lick her erogenous zones to drive her crazy nibble on her ear lobe lick her ear kiss and lick her hip bones grab some baby oil or massage oil and cover her in it and cover yourself in it then have fun sliding against each other like two sssssssslippery ssssssnakesssssss this is a great way to explore and get good at everything that doesn t involve you shoving your dick in a girl this is how i taught myself to make girls squirt bought cool new toys etc by spending a lot of time experimenting and trying anything and everything i could think of this works so well because you re giving yourself permission not to get an erection you re saying my biggest fear is completely ok i accept i won t get an erection tonight and that s fine it fixes your immediate problem of not being able to get hard now you don t have to the reason this is number on this list is it s by far the most effective way to handle your anxiety ed you need to know it s totally ok for you to not perform for a girl not use your dick and you ll both still have fun once you give yourself permission not to have sex that night once you let yourself off the hook all the pressure will be taken off you can relax and actually try to just have a good night you may also find by ignoring your dick for a while amp just relaxing and having fun with foreplay you start getting really hard hearing a girl moan talking about sexual fantasies making out etc is really damn hot and often gives you an accidental boner hurray but remember you re not allowed to use your dick tonight save it for next time after you see a girl a couple of times you ll be less nervous anyway especially if you use this tactic as many times as you need to and do everything except sex you ll find because you ve removed the expectations at some point you ll accidentally get hard because you re not obsessing about it and pressuring yourself visualise this right now i want you to close your eyes and imagine meeting a girl and just touching her a bit visualise making out with her but imagine there s no pressure to do anything with your cock in fact you re not allowed to do anything with your cock as you play out that scenario in your head and really vividly imagine it how do you feel does knowing your cock won t be part of it make you feel even slightly more relaxed and less anxious awesome we re on the way to working through your performance anxiety you can also make this into a fun game you play with her frame it as she s not allowed to have my penis yet say it to her exactly like this i don t think you ve been good enough for my cock tonight next time you ll get it if you re good tonight maybe we ll have to see girls absolutely love psychological play and being teased and denied like this they love when you don t let them have what they want saying you don t get my dick tonight and you ll have to be a good girl if you want it next time will drive her absolutely fucking wild it ll turn into a fun game for the two of you she ll spend the whole night begging for your dick please let me have it please fuck me and you ll spend the whole night saying hmmm you ve been pretty good but you re definitely going to have to try harder i think you need to be dirtier for me and show me what a bad girl you can be you ll often find telling a girl she won t be getting your cock tonight will make her start acting really filthy as she gets so horny she can t control herself and becomes sexually depraved she ll start talking filthy even innocent girls get dirty if you keep depriving them of your dick she ll be grinding her hips playing with herself a look of lust coming over her face as she realises she s lost control and just fucking wants you seeing a girl so insanely horny that she turns into an animal will often give you a huge boner in itself it s really sexy seeing someone lose control especially if it s something you haven t seen in person very often but even if you do get a boner remember i forbid you from using it tonight sorry son you ll have to wait til the next date to use it i ve done this to many girls when i was nervous worried about getting it up they all loved it many said the teasing and not being allowed to have my dick made it the hottest night of their life especially because i kept my pants on so they didn t even get to see my dick which just made them want me more yep the fact you can t get a boner can lead to the best sexual experience of her life if you decide to make it so you ll also set yourself apart there s a good chance you ll be the only guy in her life who s ever said nah i m not going to fuck you tonight you ll have to wait guys are normally horny little buggers and it s damn hard for us to control ourselves you ll be memorable for saying no to sex and making her wait that s a position most girls haven t been in all that often and it s a huge sexual fantasy for them if you deprive her and spend hours making her desperate for your cock she ll leave wanting more and will be all over you the next time if you re not all that confident you can also phrase it in a more casual less sexual way hey i prefer to space things out over a couple dates rather than dive straight into sex it s much more fun to explore foreplay and other stuff properly first say this to her when you first get in the bedroom when you first start making out so she ll know what to expect and so you ll feel like you re let off the hook no pressure to get a boner or have to perform one of my coaching clients mentioned he s concerned a girl wouldn t want to see you again if you don t bang her when you re in bed with her particularly if that was the reason she came to you in the first place ie she expected a tinder hookup but that s the thing your dick is just your dick it is not even remotely the most pleasurable part of sex for a girl you fucking her doesn t have to be the main event and shouldn t be if you know what you re doing teasing foreplay fucking a girl s mind by putting a blindfold on her touching her body all over teasing her for an hour until she s dripping wet amp begging you to play with her pussy that s how you fuck a girl s mind in a way that ll practically guarantee she ll come back for more i ask most girls i date what s your favourite part of sex with me all of them without exception say it s the teasing getting me all worked up by touching me and not letting me have your dick foreplay teasing and exploration is the best part of bedroom play not you shoving your dick in her funbox and if you re worried about not being great at foreplay touching don t stress you don t have to be great at it as i ll go into more detail below when i first started getting laid i had no idea about good foreplay or teasing or touching i lost count of the number of times i was nervous no fucking terrified and had to give myself permission not to have sex with the girl i just touched them a bit tried a few things even though i had no idea what i was doing i just explored the vast majority of those girls didn t even care that i didn t fuck them because they had fun exploring their body with me they happily saw me again for another hangout because although i wasn t having sex with them i still made sure we both had an awesome night anyway we hung out and talked a bit made out a lot i fumbled with her tits and rubbed her pussy and tried to make her cum i rarely succeeded back then again i really had no idea what i was doing if you don t know what you re doing that s totally ok just try a few things and play around sex is supposed to be an experiment it s supposed to be fun if she asked why we weren t having sex i d nervously stammer something like i want to take my time and not rush we d fool around some more i d walk her back to the train station and text her after i had fun guess what even without doing anything special even with my lackluster sexual prowess almost all of those girls saw me again most girls are happy to see you again if you put a bit of effort into trying to make the night fun you don t have to be amazing you don t have to go out of your way to be her best lay ever you just have to experiment and have a bit of fun making her and yourself feel good in ways that don t involve your dick i promise if the girl likes you and she already likes you if she s gotten naked with you she ll see you again solution cialis viagra note in rare cases these two pills can have side effects such as headaches nosebleeds etc speak to your doctor first before taking them and start on a very low dose th of a pill the first time to gauge your tolerance medical disclaimer none of this is medical advice i m only telling you my experiences i m going to call them c and v for the rest of the article so google doesn t punish me for talking about dick pills like a spammer p the reason c generic name tadalafil and v generic name sildenafil are so high on my list is they work i ve used both of them myself many times hundreds of times sometimes because i know i ll have some performance issues but most of the time it s because having a super hard dick is just so much fun now i know what you re thinking but andy only decrepit old men use v well dick pills aren t just to help your grandaddy poke your grandmumy i m as of and i ve been using c v on and off since i was around plenty of my friends and clients have experimented with c amp v too i m all for using one of them in emergencies or temporarily to show yourself that it s possible to get erections a lot of guys psyche themselves out and start believing they ll never be able to get a full erection in front of a girl which just leads to more anxiety which leads to more erectile dysfunction taking a bit of c or v gives them that boner they ve never had and they realise holy shit it is possible for me to get a full boner with a girl if i can get one with a pill maybe i can get one on my own and boom the worst of their performance anxiety goes away c and v are the shit they don t give you a spontaneous erection out of nowhere but they make the barrier to entry way lower when i take c v i get hard as soon as a girl holds my hand in public and the boner comes on much quicker within seconds little things like your girl smiling at you can make you hard or the scent of her hair or even hearing her voice it s fun as hell they make you feel much more confident because you know even if i m nervous as hell the pill will still give me an erection it s a nice safety net you ll also stay harder much longer hours and hours if you re still receiving stimulation if you re one of the guys that can get an erection but it just doesn t hold for as long as you d like c and v will help with that obviously after you cum you ll lose your erection but you ll find it comes back quicker and you re ready for round a lot quicker and the most fun part of all your erection will be at strength it ll feel harder than it s ever felt before like a steel rod you ll grip it with your hand and squeeze as hard as you can and there ll be no give no squishiness it literally feels like a stiff piece of metal it also won t go soft as easily unless you stop all sexual activity then it will which leads to sex feeling so much better because your dick actually feels more sensitive because it s so damn big and hard you ll feel every crevice of her pussy as you fuck her your dick rubbing up against the sides a blowjob feels times better than normal because your dick will throb even harder than usual some guys have a lot of resistance or even a blockage when it comes to trying c or v i don t need a pill that d be admitting i can t get it up and i m not a man you ve got to drop the fucking ego you literally can t get it up dipstick that s why you re reading this article either keep your ego or keep an erection pick one i ve had sex with a pretty high number of girls and i use c male porn stars use v if it s good enough for us to use it s good enough for you to use dosage c and v both come in different dosages but no matter what dosage pills you have the first time you try it take one quarter of a pill to gauge your tolerance the next time try half a pill that s usually enough to get your dick rock hard you can experiment with a full pill later if you like but there s diminishing returns with taking more and a slightly increased chance of getting a side effect like headaches c the pills i have are mg pills and i usually take half a pill mg of c which makes me ultra hard a full mg pill does work a little better even stronger erections and kicks in faster but i don t really need it highest i ve ever tried was mg pills definitely made me even harder and the effects came on even quicker but it s not necessary seriously i always stick to mg of c and that s always been more than good enough there s no need to go crazy high v the pills i ve used are mg pills again half a pill mg is enough for me a full pill mg is stronger and pills mg is even stronger but mg gave me a very very very slight light headed feeling that went away after minutes i always stick to mg of v timing you ll have to experiment a bit with timing as everyone is slightly different for me personally i take c hours before sex or v hr before sex for maximum effect if i m in a pinch and can t wait that much time c still works hr before sex and v min before sex but they won t be nearly as potent when you start having sex c effects will last for ages even hours after i take it i still feel the benefits v lasts much less about or hours after i take it i always carry a c pill in my wallet at all times if i m at work or something and a girl messages me wanting to meet up and i think there s a chance i ll need a little boost or i just want to be super hard so i can fuck her for hours then i ve got it on hand i ll work out how long before the date i need to take it c i usually take hours before i meet up with her but anywhere from hours works well for me v i ll take hour before a date but anywhere from hr hrs works well for me even just having it on hand will help you a tonne just knowing you could take it if you need it alleviates a lot of the pressure and nerves you often find you don t end up needing to take any at all you can even take the c v during sex if you re having issues if you start messing around with a girl and realise you can t get hard just take a v and then just kill minutes while you wait for it to take effect with c kill an hour or an hour and a half just play with her fool around go down on her and make her feel good or cuddle and talk while you wait how often you probably don t want to use c v every time you have sex or you ll start feeling like you need it and can t have sex without it which might lead to anxiety if you ever have to go without it i personally use it about in every times i see a new girl i use it less for girls i see regularly about in every times mostly because it makes the sex way more fun for all the reasons listed above it s cool as hell having a big raging erection for hours but i don t let myself need it and i ve gone long periods of several months in a row where i don t have any at all if you use it the way i do and don t use it every single time you have sex you won t build up any sort of dependence or tolerance it s supposed to be there as a boost when you need it or a crutch to help you get over your nerves anxiety if you re inexperienced or as a recreational toy every now and then just don t treat it like a mandatory requirement and you ll be fine which one to pick my recommendation and the one i use now is c simply because it lasts longer take it hours before you plan on having sex take it before your date if you like once it kicks in you ll feel the benefits for another or so hours so you ve got a nice big window in which to have sex it means you can take it and then relax knowing you ve got plenty of time in which to have sex without needing to stick to any sort of particular timing schedule because you have such a large window you know you ll be covered whenever you do actually have sex that ll take a lot of the pressure off with v you have to really know when you re going to have sex or take it as soon as you re about to have sex and then kill mins while you wait for me c is set and forget i take it and then don t have to worry about my dick at all the only potential downside of c and its not too much of a downside is you ll have to plan to take it you can t take it min before sex like you can with v but you can just take it whenever you think you might have sex with a girl even if you re not sure and if you don t end up having sex you ve only wasted half a pill the one thing v really has going for it is how quickly it kicks in so if you re in the bedroom about to have sex and realise you can t get a boner you can excuse yourself go into the bathroom and take a pill out of your wallet eat it and then just kill time with her for minutes while you wait for it to kick in you can t do that as easily with c you ll have to kill hours but again take half a c pill hours before you even think you might have sex and you won t have this issue where to get them there s several ways to get c or v go see a doctor gp and tell them you can t get it up because of severe anxiety and just want to try half a pill at a time as a little boost until you feel more confident and less anxious in the usa australia uk probably most other countries you can buy it from online pharmacies just make sure it s legal in your country and remember i m not condoning you doing anything that s against the law get the generic versions the generic version of c is tadalafil and the generic version of v is called sildenafil generic versions are much cheaper and do exactly the same thing even the dosage potency is exactly the same they are literally the same pill just not sold under a brand name solution talk to her about it it s not rocket science if you have anxiety about having sex with a girl tell her it ll take all the pressure off your shoulders and she ll be able to help you work through it rather than it being something you have to stress about completely on your own feeling like it s a shameful secret you re terrified she might find out being honest is the answer to most of your problems particularly when it comes to the pressure to be perfect i absolutely promise you most girls won t care that you re having dick problems i speak from personal experience and the experience of quite a few of my clients who ve taken my advice and been honest about it if i ever can t get it up i just point it out to the girl and say i m a bit tired or i think i jerked off too much or i m probably a bit nervous hell here s a text i sent one of my girls just weeks ago after i couldn t get it up i was super tired and had drank a lot which messes with my dick screenshot on my site me i appreciate your patience when i wasn t fully hard her i don t mind at all don t feel ashamed about it and don t let it be the end of your night tell her i guess i m nervous or some shit let s do other stuff though i really want to go down on you and eat you out as i listed in solution above there s plenty of other things you can do that don t involve your dick fool around make her feel good hangout and talk make the night an awesome night even though your dick wasn t fully present you ll find if you re honest and still hangout with her fool around with her even though you don t have a boner she ll be really damn sweet about it and won t mind at all i promise look i get that it s potentially an awkward topic to bring up but don t you dare feel ashamed or beat yourself up over something that isn t really your fault besides shame is not sexy and it s your shame self loathing that ll put the girl off not the fact you couldn t get it up it s not a big deal if you don t make it a big deal girls get nervous in the bedroom too you have no idea they re fucking terrified of doing a bad job not being hot enough for you you thinking she s fat even if she s skinny not knowing how to give a great blowjob etc even the hottest girls get nervous during sex it just doesn t manifest in such an obvious way like your boner so you don t realise it girls completely understand that guys get nervous amp have issues too they don t expect you to be perfect you re the one expecting yourself to be perfect she has no such expectations i have had so many conversations with girls about their past experiences with guys who couldn t get it up and all of them made it abundantly clear they did not care that the guy couldn t get it up they just wanted to spend the night with him fool around explore each other have fun most of them worried they were doing something wrong or weren t hot enough and were the reason he wasn t able to get it up they absolutely were not thinking this guy sucks for not getting it up in cases where the guy got really frustrated and ashamed that was the turnoff mostly because it pushes the girl away she s there being supportive and saying i don t mind at all i promise and you re literally ignoring what she s saying to you because you re too much in your own head she can t get through to you she starts thinking i feel so bad but he s not even listening to me we re not on the same team do you think she s going to be excited to see someone again who pushed her away during a vulnerable moment so just tell her you re nervous and having trouble but want to try other stuff then go nuts exploring all the other aspects of sex intimacy hanging out the next day you ll find she respects you a hell of a lot more for being man enough to confide in her because that takes balls and most guys shy away from truly opening up and trusting girls solution accept you re not a sex god yet don t stress about how good you are or how long you last similar to the first solution a lot of guys drive themselves crazy by stressing that they re not super experienced at sex cum too quickly don t know how to make a girl orgasm etc you ve gotta chill the hell out and realise it s totally ok to not be great at sex at the start i sure as hell had no idea what i was doing the only way you figure it out is with practice you ve got to give yourself permission not to be good at sex and not to last for ages if you re insecure or unconfident about your ability to give a girl a good poking or if you don t tend to last longer than a minute or two that can put a lot of pressure on yourself and lead to anxiety guys tend to have pretty screwed up ideas around what constitutes good sex being able to get an erection is wrapped up in being a real man etc same goes for lasting a long time i m not a real man because i could only last minutes all of that is bullshit good sex is you and the girl connecting liking each other and having plenty of foreplay you don t even have to be good at foreplay you just have to try a few things with her experiment with her ask what she likes tell her the things you like and figure it out together that s literally it you can t expect yourself to always be perfect at everything all the time if you worry that you re shit in bed the pressure you put on yourself can lead to anxiety especially if you worry you can t satisfy a girl properly worry you cum too quickly etc sex is supposed to be you having fun not some performance you have to put on to impress her you can get around the premature ejaculation problem not that it s really a problem most girls don t care by just having plenty of foreplay before you bang tease her touch her all over drive her wild one thing i love doing is covering a girl in baby oil massage oil and rubbing her body for a while especially her tits and pussy it makes them look incredibly sexy when they re all slick with oil and it makes them feel sexy too go down on her finger her play with some toys if you have them take your time with her do everything except use your dick in any way by the time you actually put your penis in her she ll want you to cum quickly because you ve been driving her so crazy amp building it up for so long if you only last seconds she ll love that because you spent minutes teasing her beforehand good sex is more in the foreplay than the actual sex it s about teasing and making her wait to get what she wants and that s the point cumming quickly is a good thing if you ve had plenty of fun foreplay girls get really fucking turned on by you cumming very quickly if you re not ashamed of it tell her holy shit you re gonna make me cum already you re so fucking sexy i can t help myself watch her eyes light up with lust as she realises how much she s turning you on nothing makes a girl happier than knowing you find her so irresistible you literally can t control yourself and can t hold off lasting a long time isn t sexy passion is sexy focus on taking as long as you can to tease the girl instead of focusing on i need to put my penis inside her focus on her and my guess is that focusing on taking as long as i could teasing the girl instead of focusing on when she will be ready so i can put my penis inside her was the actual game changer thebull over on the goodlookingloser forums had a lot of success following this advice he says this time i was so focused on the teasing and it lasted so long and it was so fun that it completely took my mind off my pe issues distracting yourself by just focusing on teasing foreplay really can be all it takes to fix your ed nervousness on another note if you re feeling any other sort of pressure it can dampen your erection eg a girl saying we only have minutes so we have to hurry is pressure and can turn your hard rod into a floppy noodle same if you think the girl is too hot for me or if you re inexperienced anything can be perceived as pressure that can lead to anxiety erection problems the trick is to let yourself off the hook and say i m allowed to be bad at this it s ok not to be a sex god solution do really kinky depraved things with her truth time vanilla sex can be a little boring sometimes if you re not super horny and not all that fussed about banging a particular girl that can manifest itself as a less than stellar erection oftentimes spicing it up a bit invigorates you amp injects some life into your pecker i ve seen a few girls that i wasn t crazy attracted to so i helped get myself into the mood for lovin by thinking up some wild kinky shit to do with them think of it as a great opportunity to explore your sexual bucketlist it s much easier to do kinky shit with a girl you re only half into because you won t stress so much about putting her off with all your crazy fetishes you sick fuck if a less than perfect girl is turned off by your fantasies that s fine you won t feel like you ve really lost much no offence to the girl exploring your fantasies allows you to get turned on by the fantasy itself even if the girl isn t super hot she ll get super turned on by it too and turned on by the fact you re turned on often just seeing her in pleasure and turned on will make you rock hard and ready to go ploughing if you re struggling to think up any fun fantasies you d like to try i ve written a comprehensive list of every facet of sex and kinks you could

18310,ahhh somes m nage trois two for the price of one two pussies one dick a night of debaunchery truly a gift from the gods i m not going to lie to you having a some is probably the hottest thing you ll ever do seeing two girls going wild on each other seeing them both turning each other on and getting horny as hell and then having them both turn their attention to you is hot as fuck twice the pussy twice the fun right nah son more like ten times the fun pretty much every guy has thought about having a some but very few ever actually make it happen they just leave it as a fantasy convinced it s out of the realm of possibilities i was no better i fantasised about somes all the damn time for most my my life some lesbian videos were my go to porn when i wanted to get off i spent so much of my life sitting around thinking my life would be complete if i ever had a some but i never in a billion years thought it could ever happen i couldn t even fathom the thought of me little old andy having an actual some with two real live human females another from the same day as the photo above i went for years of my life without having one because i wasn t actually trying to have one as soon as i actually decided to make it happen i had a some within months and i ve had countless more since best of all it was better than i ever thought it d be when you finally make it happen when you finally have two girls in bed with you one riding your face her pussy dripping all over your mouth while the other girl bounces up and down on your hard cock the two of them making out with each other you ll understand why somes are held up as one of the pinnacles of male sexual achievement threesomes are fucking amazing you know what else they are efficient a great timesaver hear me out when you get to a point where you re seeing multiple girls at the same time there starts to become not enough days in the week to see them all having somes means you get to see two of them at once freeing your week up a bit more for you to focus on other things career gym etc see time efficient let s get cracking read my tinder guide first amp improve yourself this guide assumes you ve already read my in depth tinder online dating guide even if you don t plan on doing online dating or using tinder ie you want to meet girls in person at bars etc still go through and read that guide i cover everything from improving your looks amp becoming a guy girls want to fuck to going on dates having wild mind blowing sex and retaining girls afterwards i also assume you ve improved yourself to a point where you look pretty decent you probably aren t going to be having a tonne of somes if you re lbs and dress like shit i ll make this really bloody clear anyone can have a some you don t have to be some super amazing player you don t have to have lays under your belt you just need to be moderately attractive and then actually try and have a some just like with getting laid normally all you have to do is improve yourself amp your appearance and hit on a bunch of girls until one says yes or in this case until two say yes that s it that s all there is to it there s no secret trick you need to perform no magic formula to having a some you just need to start asking every girl you meet if she d be up for it and eventually some will say oh alright you sexy little man let s do it i get that if you ve never had a some you may feel like easy for you to say andy but that s way out of the realm of possibilities for me i wouldn t even know where to begin setting something like that up i used to feel exactly the same way before i decided fuck it i m going to go all in and try my absolute hardest to make this happen i promise you if i can do it you sure as hell can too proof i m qualified to write this post nothing disgusts me more than people giving advice with no evidence to back it up i have a proof page with a list of pics videos and stories from girls i ve met as of writing this post i ve had unique threesomes meaning different combinations of girls each time in terms of repeat somes where i play with the same girls multiple times i ve lost count probably something like repeat threesomes i ve also had a some mfff at the start i had absolutely no idea how the hell to even make a some happen i knew i really wanted one and i made it my goal to have one but i felt completely in the dark i ve had to figure this all out myself i ve made a million mistakes had my time wasted a million times gotten oh so close to having one then missed out at the last possible second i went hardcore and made it my number mission and even then it took months until i finally had my first some over time and with practice i ve learned how to get really bloody good at meeting new girls for somes and introducing girls i m already seeing to my other girls for somes i ll try and give you everything i ve learned and save you all the trouble i had to go through at the start if i can have somes you sure as hell can too i started out obese depressed and suicidal with zero friends an alcoholic porn addicted agoraphobic loser who had no reason to live and now here i am having somes and somes left right and centre if i can do it you can do it so how d i have my first some i gave myself permission to ask for it yep i just had to say to myself i m allowed to ask girls for a some i m allowed to want this and make it happen i give myself permission to try and make it happen even if i suck at first that s literally it there s no magic formula you don t have to phrase it perfectly or be smooth when you say it the girls will either be up for it or they won t like everything else we do you just have to keep asking a bunch of girls until you find who want to try it with you i promise the worst that will ever happen is some girls you ask will say that s not really something i m interested in she isn t going to think you re some dirty sex perv she isn t going to stop seeing you she ll just politely tell you she s not up for a some no worries go ask other girls and find who are before i d ever had my first some it d been something i d always dreamed of but thought it was distinctly out of the realm of possibility for someone like me i didn t think i was cool enough or confident enough or sexy enough or enough of a player to ever make something like that happen if you re reading this you likely think the same about yourself even after i had my first one i felt like it might have just been a fluke and it d never happen again so i get it and you may be a little nervous to bring up the topic of a some with each girl don t stress i was nervous as hell in the beginning it was fucking terrifying i had to overcome my fear and just do it a huge number of girls said no but eventually two said yes the answer is always go talk to as many girls as you can you ll be surprised by the ones who ll say yes it s often not the people you d expect the first girl i had a some with had never slept with a girl before me and was so incredibly shy she d never in a billion years sleep with another girl on her own she d never have organised a some herself the only reason we had a some was because i asked for it the next girl i had a some with she literally said to me i m not bisexual and not really crazy about the idea to be honest i showed her pics of my other girl anyway and she immediately changed her tune wow she s gorgeous a week later we re all in bed together and she has the time of her life that s how i ve had most of my somes by just asking every girl seriously that s it go ask every girl you date sleep with if she s open to fooling around with another girl and some of them will surprise you by saying yes ask every girl you meet put in the work and make it happen you re in a much better position than i was i m literally telling you all the steps you need to take showing you what s worked for me there s no reason you can t have your first some month from now if you get started right this second particularly if you already have at least girl you re seeing who s open to exploring with another girl all you have to do is find one more the easiest ways to have a some you re already banging two girls and you just introduce them to each other and have a some you ask your girl if she knows any other girls friends acquaintances who might be up for fooling around with you her your girl goes and directly finds another girl on tinder hinge you go on tinder hinge yourself and directly tell girls you re looking for a some those are the easiest methods and we ll focus solely on them in this post there are also other ways to have somes you could go to a bar with your girl and both try to seduce a girl together or you could both try and seduce a girl you re both already friends with you could meet two girls at a party and try to fuck them both you could hit on a girl and her friend in public cold approach grab their numbers and tell them you should all get a drink together and see what happens this would probably be easiest with backpacker travelling girls you could try and seduce a lesbian couple that s playing on hard mode i ll paypal to anyone who shows me proof they ve done this and of course there s also male male female mmf somes i won t be covering those last here just because i don t have any personal experience with them amp they re not how i personally like having somes but if you ve tried any of these methods yourself comment below there s also a final incredibly shitty way to try and have a some you sit around fantasising about how amazing it d be to bang girls at the same time you secretly hope it ll somehow magically just happen like some porn fantasy you go to parties and get drunk and hope that drunk girls will somehow make a move on you and suck your dick just like in the pornos some guys do have somes this way but let s be real this is like winning the god damn lottery you ve got a chance of this ever happening to you by accident if you re reading my site you know we re all about taking action here and getting shit done not waiting for lady luck to grace us with her presence no point sitting around fantasising about a some let s make it fucking happen for real be persistent keep trying speaking of luck if you re relatively inexperienced or nervous about having a some or getting laid in general to some degree it ll probably feel like there s a lot of luck involved with all this yes to some degree that s true you can t control which girls will be up for a some all you can do is hit on a lot of girls and ask as many as possible if they re up for fooling around with another girl and it may take you quite a few girls before you find two who are both open to it and both find each other attractive if it does take a while don t stress just keep trying keep asking every girl you meet and try not to get too frustrated like i said it took me months of trying and it was my absolute number mission before i had my first one keep on trying the good news is once you get decent at finding bisexual bicurious girls once you know what to look for it becomes a hell of a lot easier especially as you become more confident at asking every girl and you make it more clear earlier on that you re looking for a some at this point in time i screen heavily for bisexual bicurious girls when i get their number i ask them if they d like to fool around with another girl and as such somes are pretty easy nowadays i always advocate for going all in and doing everything you can to reach your goals if you want a some use all of the main methods in this guide at the same time try every possible way you can to have a some come at it from all angles and one of the methods will eventually work for you usually multiple methods bottom line is don t stress if it takes you a lot of rejections before you have your first one keep persisting success is literally inevitable if you just never quit focus more on the girls than yourself this is a topic i cover more in part where i talk more about having the actual some itself but you ll have a much better time and be much more likely to retain the girls for more future somes if you focus on the girls rather than yourself as in you focus more on them and their pleasure and give them a chance to explore rather than just i m getting girls to suck my dick lol though that is fun too after all as much as this is a new experience for you you ll find for a lot of girls they ve never done anything with another girl so not only are they probably having a some for the first time somes aren t super common one or both of them probably hasn t fooled around with another girl before if you give them a chance to really explore each other to try different things to really enjoy and soak in the experience of being with another girl they ll be absolutely desperate to have another some with you being totally selfish and making the somes solely about you usually lowers your chances of having more in future it doesn t take a lot of effort just pick one girl to focus on for a while and you and the other girl tease her play with her body make her feel good make her the centre of attention for a bit fuck her too while the other girl makes out with her or sucks on her nipples or sits on her face let her enjoy the full experience of having a some and playing with another girl after a bit switch it up make the other girl the focus for a bit do all the same things you just did to the first girl give her the same chance to enjoy the whole experience you ll find if you make one girl the focus at a time it s much hotter for everyone involved and nobody needs to wonder what they re supposed to be doing you both just focus on the girl who s currently the centre of attention then after a while swap one of the biggest fears girls have is i don t know what i m supposed to do in a some if you do what i m advocating you get to simplify things we just make one girl feel good for a bit then we make the other girl feel good for a bit easy i ll go into more detail in part about what to actually do during the some itself so don t stress for now just keep in mind if i can make sure they both have a pretty decent time and focus on them more than myself they ll absolutely want to do it many more times in the future however if you read all this and think nah andy that s not how i want to do things i want it to be focused on me then you can do that it s your life and you can do what you want to do just bare in mind the girls may not have as good a time and may not be as keen to repeat it method bringing together girls you re already seeing this is the simplest method particularly if you re already decent at getting laid meeting new women all you have to do is ask every girl you date this question until you find who say yes ever fooled around with another girl or thought about it when two girls you re dating sleeping with say yes congrats you can introduce them to one another if you re not already dating two girls that s an easy fix go hit on more girls i also personally find this the most fun method of having somes and foursomes because you ve already vetted both girls you already know you like both of them you already know what their personalities are like and you ve already had sex with them it s a lot of fun introducing two girls to each other like you get to play host and be the matchmaker not to mention you get full credit for them both having a good time after all you engineered the whole thing you also get to feel more like you re in the driver s seat like you re in charge they re both your girls rather than one of them being a stranger you don t really know you ll feel a lot more confident directing them and taking the lead which makes things a lot easier for all parties involved vs a some where you only know one of the girls sometimes you can feel a bit like a rd wheel at the start which isn t necessarily a bad thing just different this is the method i ve used to have about half of my somes what to say amp how to bring it up as i said here s how i like to phrase it ever fooled around with another girl or thought about it asking every girl you date this question is the easiest way to set up a some and it puts the power in your hands turning somes from a lucky thing that just happens to lucky guys to i just need to go out and actively date more girls and actively ask every one of them if they ve thought about fooling around with another girl eventually will say yes i prefer not to say are you bi or are you bi curious because a tonne of girls will say they re not bi bi curious but then that exact same girl will happily fool around with another girl and still consider herself straight i know i know girls can be a bit weird sometimes i ve dated a handful of girls who ve had multiple somes with me another girl yet identify as straight even though they get massively turned on by the other girl make out with her passionately cuddle her etc often during the sex i will tease them and say are you still straight with a massive smile on my face they ll take a break from munching on the girl s pussy and look up at me her lips literally wet with pussy juice and say stop mocking me i told you i m still straight with a completely serious face then they ll go back to licking the girls pussy and making out with her so you re missing out on opportunities if you specifically ask girls if they re bi instead just ask them if they ve ever thought about fooling around with another girl and go from there i don t usually like to get too analytical with lines or what you should say because the words you say are usually far less important than just trying with as many girls as possibly playing the numbers game gets you more results than trying to be perfect but fuck it let s get nerdy anyway i like to say thought about it rather than fantasised about it because lots of girls think about fooling around but less of them will admit they re fantasising about it thought about it just implies the thought has randomly popped into her head she ll be far more likely to admit this to you rather than yeah i sit around fantasising about other girls i like to say fooling around with another girl rather than a some because most girls are fucking terrified about the concept of a some it s intimidating to them it s people she has to please but if you ask her if she s down for fooling around with another girl that s far less intimidating especially if you make it clear you ll be right there to help her and lead things much less scary for of girls than a some on that note the stereotypical idea of a some is the guy getting all the attention and being greedy and both girls feeling a bit like they re only there to fulfill his fantasy if you make it clear you want her to fool around with another girl you re making it much more appealing she gets to fulfil her fantasy along with yours rather than you being selfish and her thinking what s in it for me now that we ve gotten that nerdy shit out of the way let me repeat what you say matters much less than just playing the numbers game and saying it to a lot of girls eventually two of them will say yes and you ll be able to set up your some i ve had somes saying all sorts of different stuff the above template is just what i personally like to say just copy paste my template or say it to girls in person and get started right now don t overthink this stuff when you ask each girl if she s interesting in fooling around with another girl it doesn t have to be smooth or perfect or confident it s ok if you re nervous when you say it my voice was literally shaking the first girls i asked as for when to bring it up sometimes i ve brought it up after sex when we re cuddling and hanging out in bed basking in the afterglow sometimes i ve asked girls what s on their bucketlist and they ve mentioned fooling around with another girl or having a some then i tell them cool i can introduce you to another girl i m seeing sometimes i ve just sent this text to a girl i m seeing ever fooled around with another girl or thought about it most of the time these days i text girls before we meet up and ask them if they re up for eventually fooling around with another girl if you re nervous you might be the most comfortable bringing it up in bed immediately after sex in that moment you re both relaxed feeling intimate and she knows you won t judge her you ve just seen her naked and banged her brains out everybody lets their guard down immediately after sex this is the best time to have a conversation about it where she knows she can open up to you and show you her sexual exploratory side without any judgement again you don t have to be smooth when you bring it up it s ok if you stumble a bit if you re nervous we aren t aiming for perfection here remember you have unlimited tries there s infinite girls out there you can ask try not to be too disappointed if a girl you really like doesn t turn out to be curious to try fooling around with another girl i know that s easier said than done when i first started trying to have my first some i had a few girls i was dating say no and it really crushed me because i d put so much emotion and investment into making it happen and i really wanted it to be with those girls i was seeing because i already really liked them a lot i had to take a deep breath each time a girl said no remind myself not every girl is going to be into girls somes and then move on and ask the next girl if she isn t down to clown with another girl you no hard feelings give yourself a pat on the back for having the balls to ask and then go out and ask some more girls show them each other s photos once you have two girls who say yes to fooling around with another girl you obviously have to show each of them what the other looks like to make sure there s mutual attraction there you can do this in person eg when cuddling in bed after sex or text them each other s photos just don t spend too much time talking dirty getting them fantasising about another girl talking dirty usually lowers your chances of sleeping with girls sending them one or two of each other s nude pics is fine but if you spend days and days being extremely dirty amp sending nude pics you re just building up her nervousness and making her more likely to flake last minute you re cockblocking yourself by being overly dirty before the first meetup save it for after you ve banged once i don t have girls yet well son you better go and get girls if you ve only got girl or no girls follow my in depth tinder online dating guide and start meeting more girls or go outside and start talking to girls in person you can do approach a day have sex with them as i outline in that guide and just ask them after the first time you have sex when you re cuddling in bed if they ve ever fooled around with another girl or thought about it or ask them before you have sex either is fine this is what i did early on i ve date and have sex with plenty of girls and once i got to know them a bit i d ask if they were up for a some if they weren t no stress i d obviously keep on dating them i d meet more girls and ask those new girls the same question these days i seek out almost exclusively bisexual or bicurious girls you can do that too if you d like ask girls before the first date or bring it up during the date the ever fooled around with another girl or thought about it question generally speaking the earlier you ask the question the quicker you ll have your first some since you won t be wasting time on girls who ll never ever be up for fooling around with another girl bottom line if you want a some and don t already have two girls just go hit on more girls chapter method asking your girl if she knows any other girls remember i said at the start you should be using all of these methods in conjunction with one another as well as trying to introduce girls you re dating to one another you should also ask every single girl you date if she knows any other girls female friends who d be up for a some start with the usual question first either in person or via text ever fooled around with another girl or thought about it if she says yes you can then ask her this next question got any female friends you ve ever thought about playing with sometimes you ll get lucky and she ll say she knows someone who might be up for it talk to her about it a bit and see if she s up for fooling around with that friend of hers you if she is get her to show you some pics of this friend if you like the way the friend looks awesome get her to tell her friend something along the lines of i m seeing this guy and he s really cute what do you think about all of us hanging out having some wine and seeing where things lead get her to rephrase it however she wants whatever she s most comfortable saying to her friend however i like including the phrase see where things lead that s girl code for we all have sex but much less intimidating for her if the friend says yes or maybe some girls might be shy and they ll say maybe get your girl to show her friend some pics of you discuss with both of them a date time to meetup it s often easier to add both girls to a group whatsapp facebook etc chat so you can all talk at the same time get them both to come to your place meet in public first if they want to but it s not mandatory have some wine or some drinks if it makes you all less nervous not mandatory either make a move and have fun i ll go into details on how to make a move in part but in short it doesn t really matter what you do kiss one of them or tell them you guys should kiss or just start rubbing one both of them i ve done all those things and it all works just fine everyone already knows exactly why you re all there to fuck duh so it doesn t really matter how you get the ball rolling this is exactly how i had my first some i asked my girl if she knew any girls who wanted to fool around with her her best friend was a virgin at the time but had always wanted to explore girls and also wanted to lose her virginity awesome we talked over group chat set up a date drank some wine at my place and had the wildest some of my life we all fucked for over hours in total with breaks of course and we even fell asleep a few times throughout the night then woke up and fucked some more here s what my main girl has to say about that some the first girl andy and i had a threesome with was obviously the most scary for me it was my friend from high school we d always been pretty open with one another and she was actually the first person i d ever kissed one drunken evening at a party when i was far older than i d like to admit without being too explicit the drunken kissing back then ended up being a lot of fun even i have to giggle at the fact that we never mention it to one another again and baked a gingerbread house the next day as if nothing happened so when i first started seeing andy he pushed me to ask her if she d be interested in something together skipping over the juicy details after a lot of nervousness leading up on the actual night the three of us had a lot of fun it only happened with her the one time but it was the start of an ongoing series of threesomes i ve shared with andy oh and on a funny side note i ended up living with this friend of mine for months afterwards as flatmates continuing to never mention it maybe it would be fun to elaborate upon it in a story another day you ll be surprised how many girls have friends they fantasise about or have maybe even kissed once or twice while drunk at a party that s surprisingly common about half the girls i ask have done that it s a pretty normal thing for most non conservative girls i might be in a bubble of rather open minded people but i d say that almost all my female friends are open to the idea of fooling around with another girl at the very least from those i ve met most have experienced a little girl crush however that doesn t mean every girl will actually be game enough to do it sometimes fantasy is different from reality so don t be too disappointed if a few girls tell you they have friends they want to fool around with but they d never actually go through with it for real just keep on trying with other girls and keep trying all the other methods on this page as well chapter method you directly seek out somes on tinder hinge use this method once you already have a girl you re seeing who wants to try a some with another girl you go on tinder hinge any other online dating app and directly tell girls you re looking for another girl to fool around with you your girl essentially we re a couple looking for a third finding a some on tinder hinge etc will be exactly the same as traditional normal dating hookups on tinder hinge you need to have the fundamentals handled first look decent have good pics always be working on yourself and improving use boosts message as many girls as you possibly can don t use just tinder and hinge try all of these apps and see which ones are popular in your country city hinge top priority tinder top priority tantan especially in asia badoo especially in asia amp europe bumble coffeemeetsbagel feeld for kinks bdsm somes etc taimi especially if you re looking for bisexual girls for somes happn hily seekingarrangements only if you have money amp are happy to buy girls a drink you don t have to pay for anything more than drink skout okcupid plenty of fish pof paktor in asia any others that are popular in your country if you re doing this while in a relationship you can change your bio to in an open relationship she s bisexual and i m good at sharing that ll make it really obvious to girls exactly what you re looking for another bisexual girl to fool around with you and your girl it s also better to be more upfront you ll save yourself and the girls you match with a lot of time if you re not in a relationship and you re just seeing a girl casually you can say seeing another girl as well instead of in an open relationship or leave the line out entirely if you prefer my plan below involves you directly telling girls on tinder hinge online dating you re looking for a some direct tinder some template hey you re sexy i m your name i m looking for something very specific on here respond to whatever she says a girl i ve been seeing really wants to have fun and fool around with another girl together ever tried or it is something you d like to explore respond to whatever she says what do you like to do for fun respond to whatever she says i m into hobbies you re into what part of your city are you from i live in area you live in she lives in your girl s area her name is your girl s name respond to whatever she says you seem cool we should all grab a drink together and make sure we click what s your number i ll send you some photos of her too as always the words you say aren t nearly as important as playing the numbers game and messaging a tonne of girls until you find one who s up for it just use the template above simple concise and will save you a tonne of time and hassle experiment with your own templates if you absolutely must but i ve found it doesn t really change the results much the girl either wants a some with you or she doesn t this method of direct screening for a some can also be a lot of fun because you re already seeing girl so you can tell your girl you and i will find another girl to be our little plaything like you and her are doing something fun together you re building something this is the mindset my girlfriend and i have had when she finds girls on her tinder hinge for us to play with it s a fun thing we re doing together if you have a photo of you your girl together put that in your tinder hinge profile as well change your sexual orientation to bisexual then change your looking for settings to show me people of the same orientation first the reason we re doing this is girls who openly identify as bi are obviously very happy to have sex with girls and guys usually more open minded generally more open to having sex earlier eg on the first date it ll make your mission to have a some much easier plenty of supposedly straight girls will still have a some with you of course as i went into above it s just that girls who are comfortable enough to openly identify as bisexual are easier to get into bed with you and your girl and i ll make this clear we re not only looking for girls who openly identify as bisexual or bicurious you will have a tonne of somes with girls who literally call themselves straight but are open to fooling around with a girl or having a drink and seeing what happens in their mind it doesn t really count as bisexual i was just having a bit of fun with this girl and this guy together remember you ll need to really play the numbers game here and copy paste this template to a lot of girls in order to find one who s down don t be disheartened if it takes you a while to find one especially at the start when you re nervous not all that confident most girls you match with on tinder won t be up for a some and that s ok it doesn t matter how many girls you have to talk to in order to get laid all that matters is you got laid if you have to talk to girls to have sex once cool you just got laid while other nerds are busy calculating their percentages and odds and performance rates you re busy sticking your penis in two pussies once you find a girl who s up for it get her number send her some photos of your main girl and make sure she s attracted to your girl make sure you show this new girl s photos to your main girl too you obviously want them both to be attracted to each other you can then either meet the new girl by yourself first or meet her with your girl in public somewhere for a date or get her to come straight to your place for the some right away it doesn t really matter what you say when you re organising the actual meetup date it doesn t need to be perfect if you re reading ac some guide you already somewhat know what you re doing if you ve read my tinder guide you don t need me to tell you how to set up a date this new girl already liked you enough to give you her number so just them both of them each other s photos organise a date have fun you don t need to waste time having long conversations over text or texting a lot in the lead up to the date just organise the date maybe answer a couple of questions if she has any and then send her a text the morning of the date looking forward to tonight to make sure she s still coming texting a lot is largely a waste of time chapter method your girl finds new girls another option and one that s probably the most fun and gets you the biggest bragging rights is asking your girl if she wants to go find other girls for you to bang together it s also a hell of a lot of fun for your girl because once she gets over the initial hurdle of how the hell do i make all the moves and take the lead she ll probably find it really fucking fun being in charge for once you will likely have to help her a bit at the start since she won t be used to getting rejected on tinder online dating because she s used to doing most of the rejecting she also probably won t be used to taking the lead making the moves which she ll have to do if she wants to bring in new girls on her own especially if she s not a super confident person another reason this method is fun as hell is you don t really have to put in much effort yourself and you ll get somes for free once you ve put in the initial effort of helping her set up her tinder and telling her what to say it s free sex just showing up at your doorstep with literally effort fucking awesome i

getting started and i promise you if you start doing what i ve mentioned you ll be really fucking surprised at how easy it can be andy
18374,disclaimer i did not write this article just for people with mental illness i wrote this article for everybody because depression and anxiety are normal parts of being human and everybody is vulnerable to these emotions spiraling out of control i understand that depression and anxiety are often very deeply ingrained problems caused by a host of biological chemical and hereditary factors so if you are deeply ill i recommend that you go to some kind of medical professional and consider taking drugs to stay afloat i believe that most people can take actions that can improve their depression and anxiety but if you are so paralyzed with negative emotions that you are suicidal or cannot make any progress in your life you may need drugs until you get to the point where you can make progress i am not a psychologist or a psychiatrist nor do i have a degree in any kind of psychology i am just a guy who enjoys writing about subjects that interest him if this article helps you fine if it doesn t ignore it introduction for human beings positive emotion primarily comes primarily from two sources pursuing desirable goals and feeling accepted by the tribe pursuing desirable goals produces feelings of enthusiasm and confidence acceptance produces feelings of calm contentment and spiritual enlightenment anxiety occurs when your subconscious mind feels like you are failing at pursuing desirable goals depression occurs when your subconscious mind feels like you have failed at being accepted by the tribe anxiety and depression are linked because humans evolved to only feel accepted by the tribe after they do something to contribute to it and to contributed to the tribe you must successfully pursue desirable goals and bring back some resource for others people who do not feel like they are successfully pursuing desirable purposes that lead to valuable resources often feel worthless to the tribe and this feeling of worthlessness causes depression depression and anxiety are alarms that evolved to warn us if we are doing the wrong thing both involve a similar cycle what i call the rumination cycle an external stimulus indicates to us that we are doing the wrong thing we feel negative emotion which causes us to freeze and stop doing whatever we are doing we collect information we process the information we have collected to determine a new purpose and the negative emotion clears and we get moving again towards our new purpose depression and anxiety become pathological when we get stuck in the rumination cycle and the negative emotion never clears this can occur because the relevant information we need to pick a new purpose is not available to us we fail at processing the information correctly we are overwhelmed with too much negative stimulus to process our alarms go off for the wrong reasons and many other reasons your subconscious mind to understand depression and anxiety you must understand that your subconscious mind is not you our subconscious mind is almost like another person living inside of you who has plans thoughts feelings attractions and aversions that are complexly independent of your conscious mind when you realize that the voice is in your head is not you and that sometimes it is wrong you can engage in meta cognition which means thinking about thinking and disconnect your self whatever that is from your thoughts and emotions once you can view your thoughts and emotions with a cold objective eye you can start working on fixing some of the more destructive ones depression and anxiety are diseases of the subconscious mind nobody wants to be depressed or anxious and if it was as easy as reading a few inspirational quotes or toughening up everybody would do it the reality is that our subconscious minds sometimes develop a horribly distorted view of the world which causes them to produce intense negative emotion that is completely unjustified oftentimes people that are incredibly rich powerful and loved feel depression even though on paper they are the most accepted people in the world similarly some of the most secure and competent people you will ever meet will suffer from intense anxiety our subconscious mind is a strange thing and fixing it is often a very difficult task you may read some parts of this article and think that doesn t apply to me the truth is that the basic wiring of everybody s subconscious minds is the same some people are genetically predisposed to have slightly higher positive or negative emotion than average or to feel more or less pleasure at certain activities but the primary difference between humans is how we tutor shape and accommodate our subconscious mind your subconscious mind can be your best friend or your worst enemy and you must work hard for it to be the former battling your subconscious mind is difficult for a variety of reasons first our subconscious mind is much more powerful and sophisticated than our conscious mind so we often need to rely on it we cannot just ignore or repress it it is impossible to consciously think about every single little thing we do think and feel in our lives so our subconscious mind has input into almost everything we do secondly our subconscious mind often infects our rational mind with negative counterproductive and false thoughts in a process called confabulation i discuss confabulation later in this article so we are often tricked into thinking we are having rational thoughts when our thoughts are really just justifications for the emotions generated by our subconscious mind to make matters worse our subconscious mind often connects these negative thoughts and emotions to real data from the outside world so we believe these negative thoughts and emotions are real and justified not realizing that these thoughts and emotions are ignoring a lot of other real data from the outside world over time these negative thoughts and emotions accumulate weighing us down and tormenting us to defeat these negative thought emotion bundles it is not enough to think talk or wish the only thing that changes the emotions in your subconscious mind is action you must create a routine for yourself that generates positive emotion in your subconscious mind and then use these positive emotions to individually attack each of these negative thoughts that have accumulated trying to attack them without the requisite positive emotion is too difficult this process may take a long time because you often have years of negative thought emotion bundles to unwind and fix but you might as well get started now goal conquering human psychology is best understood in terms of purposes everything we do is either consciously or subconsciously directed to some purpose and our subconscious mind is always trying to figure out what purposes to pursue generally speaking we evolved to pursue purposes that feel pleasurable and we see a clear path to attaining humans generally prefer delicious food over mediocre food but we evolved to settle for mediocre food if we see a clear path to the mediocre food and the delicious food is guarded by a lion humans evolved to hunt and the neurochemical associated with hunting is dopamine dopamine is associated with focus confidence pleasure and enthusiasm almost all pleasure comes from dopamine whether it be eating food having sex winning something etc but interestingly our brain releases most of the dopamine on the way to the pleasurable object what i call journey pleasure rather than when we are consuming the object destination pleasure as the famous comedian artie lange once said the best part of doing cocaine is the ride to your dealer s house to get it successful people often have all the money status and friends they need but they still go to work every day because the hunt is what motivates them from an evolutionary standpoint it makes sense why journey pleasure is stronger than destination pleasure evolution needs to motivate us to hunt the deer it doesn t care as much if we enjoy eating the deer afterwards but even though destination pleasure is much weaker than journey pleasure and lasts for a much shorter time if we cannot find journey pleasure we will settle for destination pleasure journey pleasure is maximized when we venture into the unknown defeat challenges or threats hunt down a resource rich target preferably one necessary for survival and bring back the fruits of the hunt to share with the tribe goal conquering also causes us to feel accepted and valuable because we have contributed to the tribe the problem what is anxiety anxiety is basically an alarm that makes us freeze when our subconscious mind thinks we may be pursuing the wrong purpose or in other words hunting the wrong target we feel anxiety when our subconscious mind thinks that the paths to our purposes are blocked by threats or obstacles or when our subconscious mind perceives multiple equally appealing purposes and cannot decide which one to pursue when anxiety kicks in our subconscious mind enters the rumination cycle until it figures out a different purpose to pursue anxiety is also caused by the unknown in fact most anxiety we feel comes from the unknown and uncertainty rather than consciously identified threats the unknown induces anxiety because the paths in the unknown to appealing things may be populated with threats and the unknown is full of infinitely equally appealing paths anxiety is linked to memory which is why drugs that alleviate anxiety often negatively affect our memory our subconscious brain is always trying to build a map of the world around us both of our immediate physical surroundings and our abstract future it then populates this map with the threats it detects to prevent us from running into those threats in the future for example if we touch a hot stove and burn our hand our subconscious will register hot stove as a threat and try to cripple us if we consider reaching for a hot stove in the future unfortunately this map can become polluted with false alarms so we find ourselves afraid of things that are not really threats to keep us safe our subconscious mind is overly conservative so over time our internal maps become polluted with more and more phony threats causing us to become more and more narrow minded afraid of the world and stuck in our ways even worse this causes our subconscious mind will write off certain paths as impossible before they even get to our conscious mind the opposite of anxiety is confidence confidence is the same thing as journey pleasure we feel confidence when our subconscious mind feels like there is a clear path to its goals unobstructed by threat and we are making progress towards them therefore to feel confidence and defeat anxiety we need a plan that we feel like we can successfully execute if our plan feels too difficult or riddled with too many threats we will not feel confident and motivated we do not need to actually achieve our goals to defeat anxiety we just need to feel like there is a clear path to the goal most mentally ill people first manifest their mental illness in their mid s and i suspect that is because people s early s are when they are given freedom to choose their own goals and are not given any plan or routine confidence also requires certainty that you are on the correct path and by correct i mean that there is no better path for you to be on if your subconscious mind feels like there may be a better path to be on it will strike you with anxiety obviously it is impossible to be completely certain that you are ever on the best possible path and there is usually something better you can be doing but you need to come to some type of peace with your purpose i think the way to obtain this certainty is to pursue the biggest possible purposes that you are realistic for you and that you enjoy spend some time every week looking at your purposes with a cold and objective eye to make sure you are doing because anxiety depends on our progress to our goals the goals we choose partly determine how much anxiety we feel if are pursuing purposes that our subconscious mind feels are too difficult intimidating or remote we will feel anxious and overwhelmed unfortunately many people feel anxiety because they do not consciously choose their own purposes their purposes are determined by their friends their family their society their emotions and other influences they are not consciously aware of part of the reason so many people feel anxiety in the modern world is because society imposes unrealistic standards as to what people should achieve have and look like neurochemically anxiety is our default state the brain works by exchanging messages using chemicals called neurotransmitter and the neurochemical gaba slows down the activity of excitatory neurotransmitters most anti anxiety drugs like xanax and alcohol work by stimulating gaba receptors in the brain too much gaba makes one drowsy sleepy and stop producing memories in other words the alarm is on by default until we give it something abstractly a plan chemically a drug to turn it off anxiety disorders the part of the human mind that controls anxiety originally evolved in primitive animals to detect physical threats in the jungle but in the human mind it is also used to detect more abstract threats that may happen far in the future like the possibility of getting fired from our job or dying from a lightning strike because physical threats in the jungle often meant sudden death our anxiety system evolved to be risk averse and overly sensitive to threats it makes sense to be risk averse in the jungle if you take an uncertain risk the award is a little bit of food or maybe some sex but the danger is death it makes less sense however for human beings to have an overly sensitive anxiety system our minds can detect abstract threats that may lie in the future and outside our immediate perception but we often do not have enough information to accurately gauge the severity or possibility of those remote threats and because we do not have adequate information to decide our next move we get paralyzed in the rumination cycle infinite bad things that could happen to human beings so our anxiety system can register almost infinite threats at any time our capability for abstract thought makes us vulnerable to intense constant anxiety in the bible after adam and eve ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil they immediately went and hid behind a bush out of fear because they realized the world is full of threats many psychologists and philosophers have noted that the question is not why humans feel anxiety but why they do not feel constant overwhelming anxiety many psychologists and philosophers have theorized that art business religion and philosophy are all human constructions created to overcome anxiety basically humans create civilization to make us feel safe from threats and to give us goals to pursue that kill our anxiety but modern society is constantly changing and becoming more and more unpredictable and complex which has led to an increase in anxiety on top of this people are given goals by society that often feel remote unreachable and littered with threats goals which people do not have the preparation to successfully pursue modern liberal society also gives us infinite opportunities infinite potential ways to live your life and much too much information which it makes it difficult to pick a goal successfully make progress towards it and feel confident that you are doing the right thing the decline of religion a declining trust in authority a failure to adequately educate and discipline children and a news media that is intent on scaring the shit out of us also serve to increase terror what is depression depression is the feeling of being rejected from the tribe depression is a normal and necessary part of life but becomes a disorder when you get stuck in the rumination cycle and feel like there is nothing you can do to be re admitted back into the tribe depression is often characterized as learned helplessness you have learned that you might as well give up because no matter what you do it is impossible for you to contribute to the tribe and become accepted again one of our strongest emotions if not the strongest is the desire to feel accepted by whatever we perceive the tribe to be we are usually attracted to the most appealing tribe and we perceive the most appealing tribe to be the group with access to the things we want resources and can protect us and the resources when you are a child the tribe is usually your family but as you grow older it can be your friends company gang romantic lovers and society itself the tribes you seek acceptance from are determined by your values because the resources you find appealing are determined by your values at the same time however the tribe can also subconsciously and subtly change your values without you even realizing it the desire to feel accepted is stronger than almost any of our other desires which is why people often change their likes dislikes interests personality and even identity to conform to the tribes they want to join to ensure we stay loyal evolution has caused our desire to be accepted stronger than any of our lower desires people sacrifice themselves for their family their country and even their company because their desire for honor and status in the tribe is stronger than anything else sometimes even stronger than their will to live in addition the emotion of love is related to acceptance in fact some psychologists describe love as acceptance joy the joy presumably coming from the fact that the person is getting the things they want from the tribe now that they have been accepted and just as feeling accepted is one of our strongest positive emotions feeling rejected is one of our strongest negative emotions biologically speaking love is acceptance and depression is grief of love lost feelings of spiritual elevation are also related to feeling accepted by the tribe a spiritually enlightened person feels simultaneously wholeness and nothingness they feel whole because they have been fully accepted into the tribe which means they have access to all of the resources of the tribe but they also feel nothingness because now that they have access to all of the tribe s resources they have no desire for them addictions and obsessions with material things and bodily pleasures are the result of fear because we feel like have been rejected by the tribe we have an impulse to consume as much as we can because that might be the last time we get access to those resources of course this is all subconscious you never actually have complete access to resources it is a feeling that your subconscious mind generates based on the input it receives you do not need to feel accepted by every single person in the world or every tribe but you do need to feel acceptance from some tribe to stay mentally healthy humans did not evolve to live as hermits completely disconnected from one another loners claim they are happy usually because their loved ones hurt them so badly they feel better off alone but you evolved to seek relationships with others and your challenge in life is to find a good group of people to form relationships with for optimum mental health your tribe should consist of people you respect and value have fair and transparent criteria for acceptance will not arbitrarily or unfairly reject you and accept you relatively unconditionally even when things are going badly for you many things cause us to feel accepted compliments attention reciprocal interactions with others others complying with our requests being explicitly included in activities etc but the thing that most solidly makes us feel accepted is being rewarded for something we did to contribute to the tribe if we feel like we provided others something meaningfully valuable we feel much more secure in our acceptance than somebody who gets compliments or attention for contributions of little objective value like looking good we evolved to only feel accepted after we did something for acceptance so deep down we know when our acceptance is fake being competent to contribute makes us feel confident once we know we can contribute to the needs of the tribe that by itself helps us feel like we could get accepted by others conversely when we consume the resources of the tribe without contributing we subconsciously feel worthless even if people tell us we are loved and accepted deep down we still feel insecure in fact sigmund freud theorized that humans have a death instinct that makes them want to die when they feel they are no longer contributing to the tribe this death instinct can manifest itself as consciously suicidal thoughts but it can also be subconscious causing us to engage in dangerous and self destructive behaviors because we subconsciously want to hurt ourselves the evolutionary reason for the death instinct is simple once you become a liability for the tribe it is better off for the tribe for you to be dead others have theorized that humans evolved to attack enemies of the tribe and when we feel like we are hurting our own tribe we turn that rage back onto ourselves in other words depression is aggression turned inward our body attacking itself as punishment for hurting the tribe because depression is aggression turned inward you must be careful to not beat yourself up too much when you fail at something or you get rejected you should characterize your mistake as narrowly as possible fix that narrow mistake and then keep moving your attitude towards yourself should be i am a valued and important member of the tribe and i made a mistake like all valued and important members of the tribe sometimes do rather than i completely fucked up and now i am a useless drag on the tribe you also need to let go of your past failures and rejections with the same attitude i made some mistakes i learned from them and now i am back in the tribe part of forgiving yourself and loving yourself is talking about your issues with somebody else sometimes articulating your failures and rejections makes you realize how stupid and insignificant they really were depression activates the rumination cycle to figure out what we did wrong so we stop doing it and rejoin the tribe everybody feels mini depressions throughout their life which are an important tool to help us correct our behavior if you fail at something or do something to hurt others and in return people look at you unfavorably you probably should not feel good but depression becomes pathological when we get stuck in the rumination cycle and cannot escape perhaps because we do not know what we did wrong we do not know what to do to be re accepted or it is impossible for us to do the thing that the tribe demands to gain reacceptance depression induces a stress response anhedonia the inability to enjoy pleasurable things and grief similar to how you feel when a loved one passes away grief comes from the same part of your brain that causes you to feel pain so depression literally feels like you got hit by a truck depression also induces psychomotor retardation which makes it more difficult for you to move your muscles the purpose of these feelings is to feel pain stop enjoying things and stop doing things so you ruminate on what you did wrong some theorists have even suggested that one of the purposes of depression is to make lower ranked apes stop fighting the alpha male for dominance in the tribe after they have been defeated the neurochemical most closely associated with depression is serotonin the higher a person s status in the tribe and the more solidly accepted they feel the more serotonin they have conversely if one feels like they are the fringes of the tribe or rejected they have less serotonin serotonin is correlated with feelings of happiness contentment and connection with others serotonin also causes the release of other neurotransmitters that produce feelings of well being like dopamine oxytocin norepinephrine and others serotonin is related to practically every single positive emotion a person feels which makes sense once we feel accepted into the tribe we feel like we have access to all the resources and protection of the tribe for this reason most anti depressants by increasing the serotonin levels in your brain this article is too long for reddit read the rest on my website
18378,part was just posted will figure out how to embed link tomorrow now where were we one of today s lessons is try not to be a dick because karma is a thing in my mind for example you want to be my friend trust me i will make your life better because i have unique talents and i will also share what resources i have with you and the people closest to you if you do bad onto others i won t want to associate with you that in turn means you will not have access to my unique talents resources wisdom and in my opinion this will alter the course of your destiny to the less ideal side p let s pretend the world as you know it was ending i have one of the safest places to hide and there will be survivors myself and my chosen ones obviously if i don t like you do you think i m going to assist you in surviving no offense but the world is being run poorly at the moment if the universe or god s or whatever wants to balance things out a little well it all comes full circle apparently and was meant to be i learned this from a local native group in town for a good time shoutout to be rad and crisco we all know that the red pill is a toolbox but i look at life as a toolbox everything around me everything i ve read or seen goes into the database that is my brain sometimes i have trouble accessing certain portions of that hard drive though especially after too much beer i m starting to realize that the th sense may help you along with your mission by the way check those databases up top folks for subtle things the world is at my disposal and i will use opportunities and what is put in front of me along with the knowledge that i have absorbed over the years and i will create whatever the fuck i want i don t believe in luck i make it i m like an evil genius but think of me more like a good evil genius i m mr perfect and i m here to help you for real unlike when governments say it i am learning to tap into my universal powers your mission and i m going to help those around me much like how everyone else on planet earth thinks or should think rather but the world is full of retards sadly that want to stay plugged into the matrix ie social media and boob tube stuff and are not capable of thinking for themselves this is also perpetuated by institutions like government religion to keep you in line which looks to be merging into a super relig ement nowadays and polar opposite to me on the spectrum you probably have evil geniuses that are more likely doing harm to the people planet it may be unintentional though i suspect there are ones with bad intentions too i m not here to name shame people shame fear are used to get you to do something or behave a certain way but the universe has a funny way of sorting things out and everything comes full circle the snake eats itself as we like to say around here let s call it karma for the sake of this story pro tip from grandma where does your food and water come from think about that long and hard for a good minute and now think about what would happen if anything really happened to that food water source so even if you re poor and down and out i am literally giving you a guide to pick yourself up and make your life better it could always be worse you could have no food water and just to be clear here i want the whole world to get this message if you fuck with my food and or water supply and let s extrapolate this a little my way of life i guess well did you get the earlier memo one of my goals is to live to just for fun let s say this isn t set in stone obviously i can t control the whole universe yet i am going to live longer than of you i can almost guarantee that unless you are smarter and healthier and younger than me some of you here may surpass me if you want to fill your boots the point of this tiny message is that i have nearly infinite time at my disposal and enough resources to almost do whatever i please please don t fuck with my life it s so much fun if i m an unhappy camper well you re also going to be an unhappy camper the world should have enough resources to provide a decent life for all if humans could get their shit together and stop doing unnecessary things ie wasting your life and let s be clear i don t want you to be me i want you to be you to use your brain and the universal god given powers that your brain body are capable of set yourself some goals and slowly work toward them or don t i m not good at setting goals by the way i like to go with the flow aiming to be as a chronic weed smoker i m literally a mish mash of weird shit you should see my garage aka the j ym right now where i m writing this but i m fucking fun and anywhere i go i know how to have fun or make fun with the people around me therefore people love me or at least i think they do i m also good at being inquisitive sometimes and can poke and prod and encourage people to do better in their own lives this is one of my many talents you could exercise this just use your brain and apply the red pill knowledge to the real world no need to be cynical in my opinion you have this one life to make something amazing of yourself try not to fuck it up all right of humans are well let s be nice this time not fulfilling their destiny they don t want to think for themselves most likely because fear is a powerful thing that controls their actions reactions it really helps to take account of yourself know who you are what you re capable of and do not be afraid to admit your shortcomings but as we have covered and you may have already read a minute ago put it in your toolbox ie your brain in case you really are that slow i ve met some handsome young but dumb fuckers in my experiences of property management try not to be taken advantage of i guess would be my advice to you just be yourself and figure out your shit what you want and work towards it you don t need to put on a show by the way a lot of people struggle with their ego a concept that will plague humans for all time i m sure unless we figure that shit out and educate the entire planet maybe they can start by reading this message haha it s okay if you re gay not that there s anything wrong with that or you feel you re something else inside or if you want to dress up in a suit and pretend you re an animal just try to blend in with society in general try not to ruffle feathers we can all get along on this planet and probably better utilize our time brain power skills to make the world a better place take a good hard look in the mirror by the way most people i know are afraid to look at themselves in the mirror and take account of who what they are and what they are doing with their lives ask yourself this is what you re doing at any given point in time the best use of your time to further reach your goals where i live there are people standing on the street corner preaching the word of god in their own interpretation feeling and right next to that you can find a group of queers shaking their ass and whatever god gave them in the streets for all to see i guess the point is to let me know that they re different but here s another reality check i don t give a fuck leave me alone actually i am far too busy to concern myself with your non existent problems and genders and while we re here back in my day we just called you queer you really started pissing me off when you went beyond lgbt at this point you just want attention i suppose i wrote an email to my friends once saying they re going to add spirit next and sure enough they did someone is probably making money somewhere by doing this dumb shit if you know that person tell them mr perfect says the new acronym it s not an acronym is queer and for them to stop fucking around and do something productive instead of consuming other peoples precious time the loudest people get what they want these days but sadly the loudest people aren t the smartest people because they can t rationalize well probably anything really at the end of the day you need to survive which means food and water and shelter the western world has things a little bit too easy in my opinion so much so that they can frivolously spend their time on the street dancing for attention but not actually being productive it s good that the world is open to discussion but let s do it productively shall we now i ll admit i m not actually perfect hahaha look at my teeth i don t have abs i drink beer i smoke weed more than i should and you know a bunch of other shit but i don t like excuses in fact i m so smart i can tell when you re giving me an excuse excuses are for people that are not being honest or living in reality we used to call them john s because john was some dude that made a bunch of excuses all the time because he lost at a game it s okay to lose at games in case you didn t fucking know i enjoy playing darts it s a lot of fun and slightly competitive during this lockdown mumbo jumbo where stupid people get to dictate how i should live my life i set up my garage to be a nice hangout man cave type thing and i have a dart board at the center of it i m not amazing at darts but one day you might just find me on the pdc world stage given enough time and you bet your ass i ll be wearing that t shirt now the moral of this tangent is that my roommate friend and i have been honing our craft over the past year or more however any time that he fails to do good or meet our average let s say well guess what comes out of his mouth words that don t fucking matter my arm is sore i m tired and if you pause and think about this for a second here ie put this little nugget in your toolbox you ll be able to notice that most people you interact with are not actually good at things and in fact complain about them at the end of the day do those words help you do anything not really and when you think about it it s actually a negative energy of sorts you re reinforcing the concept in your brain subconscious that you re not good at something and therefore you will probably not get better at it now look at it with my lens the red one i am here having fun and learning and trying new things trying to throw darts differently spending my time at the board thinking about how to throw them better so that i can get to the fucking world stage hahaha hey i m a dreamer and i have an infinite bucket list but the point is i ll get there because i m improving myself slowly and with time however people like john or jane this tale applies to all humans let s be real spend their time making excuses all day if people spent less time consuming and excusing pointing fingers and more time producing shit the world might just be a sweet fucking place to live i mean it s cool at the moment and i plan to check it out with some upcoming world travels but it would be nice if everyone stopped fucking wasting in general now again i m not actually perfect i still eat if someone puts it in front of me for example but the people that put fish into cans are raping the oceans which is probably causing the most harm to the planet if i had to hazard a guess i know a man that once did something along those lines but ended up releasing the catch apparently those fish are thriving now in that community so to all those fisherman out there are you doing the right thing and are you using your time skills to the best of your advantage and making the world a better place i m all for fishing to feed yourself of course teach a man to fish yadda yadda yadda kind of makes me wonder what people do with guns in their hands all around the world probably if all humans were perfect like me we wouldn t need weapons and such but the world is a little bit too large for me to take on right now i promise if you elect me as your global leader one day we ll have a really good fucking time so here we are on this fun little tale did you learn something in case you didn t do not be dumb do not hurt people do no harm and do not wish harm onto others this should apply to all species i suppose but darwinism and evolution are a thing too pro tip some species get wiped out because they cannot adapt and survive history has some very interesting tales if you pay attention and exercise that th sense at the end of the day we all do better together but in today s world everyone wants to point a finger at someone else for problems let s say but all problems in my opinion come from within if you cannot feed yourself find water and shelter for yourself well what the fuck are you doing you could kill yourself i suppose but what fun is that you re missing out on all the fun shit that this world has to offer please don t kill yourself by the way if those thoughts ever cross your mind you always have options trust me i may not have time for you personally but think closely about the people around you and why you feel the way you do times out of you are who you associate with now if you re still suicidal yet also really fucking cool and interesting then i ll make time to sort out your life i like to hang out with cool interesting fun or unique people sometimes hopefully that i can learn from apparently i m a sociopath so i ll definitely take advantage of you and your skills to further my agenda but it s a good agenda rest assured and i wouldn t call it taking advantage of in this scenario in fact you are probably being more rewarded than what i get in return if only there was some way to see into the future and measure your overall life happiness i d prefer to have some land grow my own food eat healthy and work on whatever projects hobbies i feel like but that s just me i hate it when people say you do you because it sounds like an excuse people being uncomfortable with what others do so they say you do you but probably they are judging you internally for whatever failures they cannot overcome be it physical or mental emotional just something to pay attention to as you interact with people are we all being genuine here so even if you think you re down and out it could always be worse trust me you could be the poorest person in africa right now but if you re reading this maybe this is your rock bottom of sorts this is the moment where you start to think for yourself and look around you and figure out what the fuck you want to do how you re going to do it and who is going to help you do it along the way while you re doing that make sure to help other people out if you can the best case scenario is when everyone wins it gets even better when things are done efficiently so ask yourself every day are you winning son life is a game and most people are playing it wrong in my opinion pareto estimates that are npc s we went down this rabbit hole on the lgbt narrative but think of it as a metaphor how are you spending your time what message are you relaying to those around you and the world at large in some instances given the power of technology these days again the people with the loudest megaphone may not be giving you the best advice it s ok to take in the data points and intermingle those with your own thoughts feelings personal experiences but remember my rules and try to make the world a better place along the way as you struggle to survive and achieve whatever your goals are just make sure your goals are aligned with your capabilities you can literally do anything you want on this planet stick to my rules though dream up your wildest life and then figure out how you can make that a reality losers mope around all day making excuses john s about why they can t have this or that winners like me don t fuck around i mean i used to fuck around and i ve admitted at least once today that i constantly fuck around i used to have a day job what a waste of my fucking life hahaha hey mr perfect can i pay you hour to sit at the computer and do things for us you can have weeks of your time back but you have to earn it by working for us for year doesn t that sound like a sweet deal while i was doing this i was texting girls telling them that i get paid a lot of money to sit at a computer and look pretty hindsight is though and this is not a sweet deal trust me i now have unlimited time to do whatever the fuck i want why are you spending your time working for someone else put people to work for you but again make their lives better along the way most people these days are caught up in surviving but in the flashiest way possible we call this keeping up with the jones i ll admit i had been rocking some sweet fake rolex watches not too long ago i always wanted to buy one because it was a symbol of status wealth success etc i had a guy almost offer me or something one time at a bar for my fake rolex he thought it was a hulk which means it s green on green we chatted a bit i let him examine it for a while but eventually i told him it wasn t real i would have felt bad to have conned him i suppose back in the day i was all about making a quick buck like gambling in the stock market but what i m really learning these days is that hard work and dedication pays off and is far more rewarding and there may be something to working hard and tapping into those universal powers i keep talking about like the god s favor me or something maybe cause i m good at helping others wink wink i m pretty sure i m destined for some epic shit and i m slowly figuring out how to utilize planet earth to make that a reality speak of the devil someone is calling me i m telling you there are some funny coincidences out there if you pay attention they don t really deserve my time because i do not favor them be careful how you treat people along your travels my friends they just might turn into the elites of the world at some point in the future now i do not wish ill on this person i will help them when i have the cycles if i feel like it i m too busy writing this epic novel for all you readers out there trying to make sure you don t turn into a dick and screw people over like this dude brief side story i worked under with this guy very smart and young and helped him rent his properties out but at the end of the trail damage deposits stopped being returned most likely because of greed on top of that i was probably owed about or cad so not really that much in terms of monthly pay expenses out of pocket but i always felt bad about the people that were poorer than i that were actually getting shafted out of their money well over the course of this week i managed to collect all the missing information and kindly refunded those people out of my own pocket half of it was because i could and the other half was to teach said individuals a lesson said individuals may in fact be npc s i m not going to lie but i can finally close this chapter on this thing that s been bugging me just yesterday i went for a bike ride with my girl and found a spot to have lunch on our way home while i m there the girl under my wing from a year or two ago said it turns out she works here mr perfect hey what s up mr perfect oh hey how are you year old tenant i m great so what the heck happened mr perfect well i made some magic happen i m a wizard after all year old tenant thank you so much i texted my roommate and said uhhhh mr perfect just gave us our back aside from her there were other actually from a month ago that were not paid what was owed i have spent my precious time this week while crafting this message to give some of my magic numbers to those individuals that were wronged it s funny because i like to tell people that i m a negative millionaire so what s more magic numbers that the douchebag owes me right the bankers don t need it the peasants do do not worry reader mr perfect will hold the bag on this one current song playing i will be here i m pretty sure i owe like a million dollars to the banks and such don t come and sue me though i have nothing but shiny paperweights weed and those are mr rogan s coins of my future best friend queen elizabeth ii the truth is that i will be just fine i don t do things foolishly but i ve been in a pretty generous mood as of late you want to be my friend i will share things with you this is one of those feel good stories that should tug at your heart strings or at least make you think if you don t think or feel anything well let s have a talk the current song playing is called come alive i m an asshole i might just be the perfect asshole in fact if you recall you want to be my friend i can help you be a better you and help you achieve your goals in probably the most efficient way so again ask yourself and maybe ask it every day for days straight to form it into a habit what are you doing with your life and why i would assume you re male if you re reading this i know there are women that lurk too we need to work together in order to build a better future existence for ourselves for a start because at the end of the day all you have is yourself but we humans work better together we called this taking advantage earlier i swear i m here to help you lol so quit wasting your time and please do not waste my time with your problems most of the issues i deal with are people just being dumb and or lazy again i am here to help you with your goals but let s be efficient and have fun along the way shall we did i mention i worked in it for years the world of it and corporateland at large shoutout to uncle vas are full of dumb and lazy people that photo up top was my year anniversary at my last job i always joked to myself about not wanting to be on that wall it only took me another year and a few months to say goodbye i have been crafting this message over the course of this week it is one of the most important things i can be doing not only have i been journaling but also able to pause and think and reflect on things i need a weed top up and i need to piss so let s take a break here for now oh and i should mention be aware of yourself and your body just because i can smoke weed all day i m immune and be an extremely awesome dude does not mean that you can take things in moderation and do not be afraid to experiment but again don t be stupid and try not to annoy anyone else in the process if you do the wrong drugs in the wrong places well your mileage may vary these are my super powers as mr perfect what are your super powers now here we are for round of sorts weed pipe loaded as i had my break another funny thing happened i got a message from the girl i m seeing and her new business card has an email address with a in it so i laugh to myself knowing the uniqueness of the name and the size of the company position i guess the other email also belongs to her but at the other site where they no longer work this is a promotion to a manager position so i find it amusing and unacceptable if i had to go around saying my e mail address is mr perfect com mailto mr perfect com in line with my message previously who the fuck are you you re the only you right i mean we like to think we re unique but most of us truly are not we need to belong to a tribe herd because with social cohesion we can survive all the shit that life and the universe throw at us sadly boring dull people that follow the herd do tend to survive but i m not going to let some generic study done by some scientists dictate my survival rate i make my own destiny in case you haven t figured that out yet my message to the girl was to politely find who can make the changes and make the accounts tied together and then get a new business card so you don t have to explain to the dumb people of the world why there is a in your email plus it doesn t look cool i know that some it nerd can adjust this with a few clicks on the microsoft exchange server but as i said people are dumb lazy and usually afraid to make other people uncomfortable with such simple requests so the girl may in fact not want to waste peoples time but at the same time she is wasting my time and your time as well by not promptly resolving this if it s not resolve i may spend some of my infinite time to find said it nerd i m sure he s a nice guy and drives a subaru and get this adjusted so i don t have to ever hear about that time that someone sent her an email to the wrong address i ve worked with people that make more than an hour but still managed to fuck my name up in a simple email oh and i ve seen people make more money but are incompetent sometimes it s okay because of the culture asian cultures tend to use last names first maybe they were tired or not paying attention but other times people are dumb and lazy i used to save them in a folder because it was good for a laugh probably had around fuckups over the years funny side story i ran into a man recently he was alone at the bar i frequent my friend and i ended up in a chat with him his name is mayur he also works in it and he told me that people do not even get his name right and he s been working with them for years inception i m pretty sure spanish names that start with a g or j are pronounced with an h i find it amusing but also rude when the people around you can t even pronounce your name right like if you actually cared about a person you would at least know their name but most people are selfish lazy dumb something sparks lighter so my buddy mayur is pretty fucking smart and probably way richer than me why would you want to fuck his name up and annoy him we can end this tale here as we don t want to dwell too much moral of the story don t be lazy think about your future and the image you want to project you can be unique but only with time and effort no need to flaunt it as mentioned earlier don t let your ego get in the way of being productive i prefer to fly under the radar of society myself you re probably thirsting for stats on the girl by now she s a solid not just my opinion and checks all the right boxes for wife the only problem is she won t let me be with other women unfortunately for her destiny has a much greater purpose for mr perfect than settling down now for a wife in kids that time will come maybe in years or more who really knows i was never really for kids but now as i learn more about the world we exist on i can understand the need for a few really fucking good men to reach the year i am aiming to see the year personally if my math is right as you keep saying things like this though you can manifest them in a weird way like if i keep telling myself that i want two hot asians to give me a blowjob at the same time it will happen someday perhaps haha maybe the girl will turn into mrs perfect one day i am guiding her on the right path but her destiny may be different than what i can offer who knows it s been an interesting journey to think about the ups and downs and the why of everything at the end of the day i was never really being honest with myself for example you ever feel the odd desire to do or try something or the feeling that something isn t right well why the fuck are you settling down if it doesn t feel good fortunately for me i have been able to watch everyone else fuck up around me perception is a good skill i m just learning now how to focus all this wisdom and put it into words i have fucked up a lot too in my day but it s the best way to learn in my opinion you must do something to figure out if it s for you or not but at the same time you need to think carefully about the repercussions of your decisions most people do not think about their actions myself included sometimes but as you get older or maybe it s just wiser you can be more calculated something i wouldn t fuck around with is trying to alter your physiology with hormones and surgeries in order to outwardly display what you feel on the inside i m sure there are better ways to deal with such things and i think the human body should be more aligned with natural medicines instead of chemical ones if you catch my drift but we shall let darwinism and the universe play their cards i just don t like wasting time so whatever you think you re trying to do you better think long and hard about the consequences and use history as an example but in this case i don t know of any well documented times in history of people altering their bodies with chemicals tools i bet the egyptians did it or the people of sodom and gomora maybe but then i guess god fucked them up maybe cause they were being dumb and wasting their time on earth who can say really p fortunately psilocybin is coming to the rescue to fix the coming wave of depressed people that can t figure out how to exist my theory is people have it so fucking easy so much time on their hands that they don t need to worry about food water as it s readily available so they decided to explore things that are probably dangerous to them in the long run it would be a fun experiment to take young people and maybe their retarded parents and drop them somewhere in the wild make yourself a house find some food and water now try and survive and then let s see how much time you must waste on wanting to identify as a non binary did i mention i was an asshole am i offending anyone haha remember i also don t apologize i think i m being reasonable here i want all humans to thrive together and we can do it in mutually beneficial ways i am certain the current global society isn t the right way in my opinion i m retired and bored so i spend my time thinking about dumb stuff like this perhaps i m just preaching about my own utopia one day i may have that but i m still here in reality with you the reader if you disagree with me you could downvote this message and nobody would read it but that s what dumb and fearful people do they hide things that make them uncomfortable some things make me uncomfortable but i am learning to co exist and make things better it takes time but i am learning every day so i encourage you to leave a comment if you have an issue with anything i ve said i am not perfect i simply observe the world around me and use it to my advantage i may have time to reply i may not i currently have about people that i employ if you will and i think i m supposed to onboard more today but i ve been busy spending my time and having too much fun with this tale i hope i m not humble bragging i always knew i would write something like this i just wasn t sure about the timing and what i wanted to share with people in the community i literally lurked around for a few years and absorbed a lot of knowledge while pretending to work in it and being paid well to look pretty and sit at my cubical actually i did most of my reading on the swanky rd floor in the afternoons please help mr perfect be the best human he can be if we have a problem here that way i can spread the good word around the world on my upcoming travels we need better societies in general i think i haven t figured out the perfect system but i am willing to bet money that whatever the great reset mumbo jumbo is about is probably not the right system either i m open to discussion on any matter leave a comment or send me a private message and i ll try and help with what little advice time i have but don t forget i m enriching about other peoples lives today not including friends and family that i sometimes pay attention to so there is a long queue it helps if you give really good blowjobs though i ll bump you up to the top of my priority list at the moment eric prydz opus is playing and the beat just dropped a fairly fitting universal coincidence one could argue pauses hard times create hard men hard men create soft times soft times create weak men weak men create hard times or something along those lines i m sure now in case you are in fact living under a rock in africa we are in the weak men create hard times category of whatever phase or turning you want to call it maybe we could get a wmcht trending on the internet alongside that fuck joe biden one you know to let the weak men of the world know the ones still shaving with gillette mach s that mr perfect thinks they are shit and could be better humans there may in fact be some universal cycles that i have yet to explore but we can say that history does repeat itself at least at some level get your shit together now and plan accordingly is my best advice to you my future friends there is still time if shit were ever to hit the fan let s just say as for me i m going to head to japan sometime soon it feels my th sense is sending me there i d like to buy a house there nothing fancy just japanese just something fun to do while i learn the local language i first went there when i was on an exchange tons of fun i love the japanese probably some of the most friendly people i ve met but hey everyone loves me or at least i hope you do and if you don t that s a you problem until next time my friends stay healthy eat right avoid sugars i guess and complex foods i m not actually a doctor but i could probably do a better job than most doctors out there get your vitamins c d and selenium sulfate if you re not fat and or old you too could aspire to be a healthy fun and interesting individual just like me and if you re really lucky you might even be able to survive that new coronavirus thing floating around the world s trust in the words of mr perfect and your life will be much better i ll probably end up a cult leader of sorts in the future this makes my mom freak out hahaha i shouldn t need to hide in the woods from the boogeymen of the world but at the same time the institutions of the world are quite pervasive in peoples lives as they always have been according to history it probably revolves around the need to control resources or people for whatever the narrative is i haven t sorted out all of the mysteries yet but after this message to you folks i plan on writing a letter to the queen of england apparently she writes letters to people that reach years of age unfortunately she won t be sending me that letter if you ve been paying close attention i have a few things i d ask a few things i d share much like this ramble i thought it would be hilarious the other day if she replied i day dreamed about popping by the palace on my upcoming world travels maybe she d personally invite me and then i d take a selfie with her after a short chat over tea imagine my photo above but with her majesty and a big fucking grin on her face like this gt d conclusion my cousin was coming over at the time of edit post it s way late as i help him plot his retirement he is older than me and i have learned a lot but he can also be a dick at times and he will hide behind the demonstrate higher value slogan but really he just weirds or grosses people out sometimes the sad thing is that he finds value in telling other people about his sexual conquests must be an ego thing i suppose he is a good person i m sure as are all people initially and i will help him achieve his potential and try to reign in the douchebag part at the same time with my magical powers he s got a bit of that pua vibe i guess and i d say don t be like a pickup artist don t do things to manipulate outcomes in a weird robotic fashion eg canned repetitive lines on women i ve been there and done that so trust my words i watched a slightly balding man probably in mid s at the park talking to a girl and my intuition was right when i guessed he was picking up on the woman a little above his league given he wasn t in good shape but that doesn t really matter remember anthony mackie i don t need to preach about what genetics and or god have done to you but when you re smart and have something that people need it doesn t matter what you look like don t try and be someone that utilizes their skills to trick others be real honest work hard and acquire skills resources and knowledge so that you can provide something it could be a service it could be a product it could even just be an ear for someone to blab some dumb shit to so they can vent women if you build it they will come whoever they are it depends on who you want to attract to your life do you want women build yourself into a man that women will want do you need resources what s the most efficient way to acquire those resources within given norms of your society don t be a thief please in the end it s all just dishonesty which doesn t jive well in the universe i feel you could come and try and steal seth s future satchel of gold coins and maybe enrich yourself temporarily this is assuming i m not there smacking you upside the head with the silver paperweight but with a short amount of time i could teach you ways to enrich yourself much farther than that small amount of gold will get you one time i accidentally gave someone it was a technical issue early in my it career one senior made a comment about some fuck up being a picnic problem in chair not in computer long story short i asked for it back and the guy gave it back you could consider him one of my employees at the time a brand new hire well now that kid is one of my managers and is probably going to surpass making that kind of money by the end of the year trust me that s a lot of money to a very poor person i do apologize if this feels random i probably have adhd or something i wouldn t know and don t really care no john s and even if i do well it s just another tool in my toolbox if i can own adhd so can you i m being a bit facetious here obviously talk to your own doctors the point is if i can be awesome so can you i will bid you farewell for now as i m running out of time to vote speaking of voting some pencil pusher s in ottawa made a pamphlet with a word salad and some images it probably cost the tax payers a lot of money in terms of paying the people to make the useless pamphlet paying the people to mail and deliver said useless pamphlet you get the point if you know this person or team of individuals please tell them mr perfect says to quit fucking around and wasting the poor folk s money did i mention i was poor too you could have just sent a one page pamphlet that said vote ppc in my opinion now i must be off be safe out there kids and be good to one another
18411,if you want to see the interesting part of this post jump to the bottom to start off i don t want to see any comments about me generalizing people if we can t admit these trends exist we will forever be trapped as a community i have to start this post by saying i have nothing against white people i actually admire white men for the social status and and smv they ve been able to gain and maintain for the past few centuries i also have to start this post by saying i am not a racebaiting blackpill loser while i am in my very early s i am not a bum and am working on self improvement i am i wouldn t call myself a slayer but i think my bodu count is decent for my age at i earned more than of adults k a month am struggling through a top tier school and am in the gym trying to cure my chronic scrawniness i do not want this post to be met with black guys have the highest smv quit whining you re using race as an excuse i don t know why often times white men will get angry when black men talk about their uniquely black issues i don t even hate white people i acknowledge white men have the issue of being demonized by the media being told they re all racist and the same feminism that destroyed our community is now invading theirs but that being said i would like to talk to the black men who read trp today regardless of this spiel i m going to say some controversial i would like to talk about the black man s smv and how it affects our community as a whole amp x b black men we are tied with dravidian indians for the lowest smv in the smp i m not really talking about the lightskin mixed looking guys with the curls not the guys who look like kelly oubre jr their exotic phenotypes grant them a halo that exempts them from the negative stereotypes we have day to day i m talking about those of us with predominantly subsaharan african features with the same phenotype as kevin hart michael b jordan chadwick boseman idris elba and let s be honest most of us were not blessed with their looks we have the lowest smv and that stunts our growth and the growth of of our community and i will explain why in terms of what i consider smv looks money status charisma with the order of importance being looks charisma status money or for rmv relationship market value charisma status looks money amp x b looks in our society white is the standard of beauty everyday anyone my age who scrolls on tiktok can see white guys getting simped over by thousands of teenage girls guys like bryce hall and carter vought while their black male equivalent is an incel watching alpha male strategies and what is the racist that looks the most different from all the others black men our big noses protruding jaws dark skin and kinky hair are considered unattractive by the vast majority of women of other races even by a large percentage of black women they will just never say it out loud due to modern sjw culture the truth is most women secretly consider black men to be ugly most black men are delusional about this fact but what race has the lowest match rate and response rate on all dating apps it s not asians black men have a weird thing going on where we have been protected from this truth because for some reason it is considered acceptable for girls to make creepy ugly smelly indian jokes whereas if they were to say the same thing in public about black men there would be social outcry black women know about this fact though and it is a large part of the cause of their resent for black men more on this later additionally black men just genetically tend to have more masculine facial features the red pill can cope all they want about just grow a beard get jacked and shave you head bald bro but this is not what women are physically attracted to women like men with athletic bodies maybe not super big and muscular but tall and shredded like a basketball player red pillers think you need to be arnold schwarzengger tier if you can rep you re probably fine if you can max out plates and you re low bf you re pretty much already what the peak of what women will be physically attracted to provided you ve worked out your lats traps neck and abs and shoulders to improve neck size and shoulder to hip ratio black men have excellent muscle building genetics so they should have no problem with that the problem lies in face and height yes blacks tend to be taller than hispanics and asians but white guys are still taller additionally for face women like long hair or curly hair with feminine facial features on a strong masculine caucasian skull a masculine skull is a large one with a square jawline and deep set eyes feminine features are neotenous like long eyelashes thick dense eyebrows plump limps clear skin think feminine noses high prominent cheekbones black men on average will not have these features our facial features are on average more masculine and less pretty our hair is not long or flowing we will never look like justin bieber vinnie hacker zayn malik or even kelly oubre for guys my age these tiktok celebrities who become famous for being pretty boys like vinnie hacker would a non mixed lightskin black man ever become the standard of beauty like that the beauty standard facial is currently the opposite of us the most important part of smv looks is working against us a black man has to look like idris elba austin dunham or michael b jordan to be seen as the equivalent of some white dude just strictly speaking physically now there are some woman i d say about where a black dude is just as attractive to them as a white guy or in some cases even more attractive just physically speaking but then these guys get filtered out even more by other factors amp x b status and money even more than looks this is by far the biggest thing stopping many women including those of our own race from being attracted to us let s say you get past the physical filter this filter will immediately block out of women over the age of from ever taking you seriously and using you for anything more than a one time fuck for money black men are the lowest ranking group socioeconomically in every country we go our countries in africa are the poorest in the world you think the rest of the world doesn t somehow notice this because of our low socioeconomic status the overall poverty and crime rates in our communities the chaos and corruption in our countries the rest of the world views us as low class criminals low iq impoverished can t take care of our women or our communities overly sexual the minstrel class gang bangers etc that spanish girl who you see post black lives matter graphics on her ig story she sees you as inferior and feels bad for you that biracial girl who looks like zendaya you been dming she views black men as less than white men and would take a white guy over you any day that white girl you been fucking she views all black men as cheaters feels that they treat black women poorly and that she can use and abuse you because she thinks all black men lust after white women more on this later and would never consider taking you seriously it s a known thing that in many bmxwf couples the white wife regularly talks down black people and calls her husband one of the only good ones i ve seen it time and time again to be considered a good option to attractive women of even your own race as a black man you have to be making six figures or more and prove to them you re not like the others on top of that you have to be good looking and charismatic whereas all a white guy has to do for an ltr with a is be a with good social skills and not skinnyfat this isn t to say that white men have it so easy for white guys to slay a new girl every week they have to be a good bit above average but for a black man to even get one decent quality girl he has to be pretty far above average i d say for white guys the rule is more like for asian guys it s for latinos and arabs it s but for black men and indians it s again not counting these mixed race and light skin guys here a black man has to consistently compensate for the fact his race is poor and perceived as criminals to prove that he is not like the rest to women his nonblack male peers and his employers he has to make twice the income make an extra effort to come across as nonthreatening and work twice as hard to prove he is just as worthy as his white and hispanic peers on average a black man has to be at least make k be fit and charismatic and be a in the face at least just to attract s that a white boy has had access to since high school i m not saying this to discourage black men i m not even saying this is a hard rule like in more liberal areas where there is a large minority population like california or toronto this may be less of an issue but for the majority of black men the statements i make will be true amp x b let s talk about status now in other racial groups what is a high status career doctor lawyer engineer tech founder entrepreneur professor in our community these careers are seen as lame and for the white man in our community what is seen as high status rapper singer entertainer athelete gang banger jail bird in our community people thing the only high status careers you can have are in entertainment sports or crime careers that are unrealistic for of the population and are fundamentally about being dancing monkeys for every other race as woke girls on twitter say they love our culture but hate us this causes black men to be seen as the entertainment dancing monkey class for every other race this teaches black men from a young age to essentially aspire to be bums am i saying just be a thug bro grow dreads get chains and tattoos and start selling drugs just nuke your employability bro no i hate when people give this advice all you will attract like that is complete ghetto gutter trash that you wouldn t wanna touch if you had two brain cells i will touch more on this later but this selection for shit careers reinforces our poverty cycle but because so many black men are pursuing low value careers it further lowers are status and contributes to the fact that black men as a whole have built nothing of significance compared to whites and asians in the past years charisma thus is the only category in my opinion where black men are seen as better than all the other races this is overall a good thing we are seen as charismatic funny good dancers charming etc the only negative with this is that us being seen as having charisma and nothing else reinforces the stereotype that we are for fun and entertainment to women and society but nothing else amp x b the black women question i would say overall the black woman is holding back the black man i would not say this entirely her fault it is at least our fault however we have gotten to a point where we will have to solve a large part of our problems without them many of us think the black woman is loyal to the black man the truth is she is only as loyal as her options every other race has an easier time getting white men since women are more race loyal than men except for when it comes to white men however the white man views the black woman as unattractive so they are resentful that they have a harder time dating out than black men additionally we a black men do a terrible job lifting up our own women the pillars of our community which are unfortunately athletes and entertainers constantly uphold the white beauty standard which is the opposite of black women and i frequently see black men bashing black women in public they do the same but still dudes dark as night talk about they would never date black women amp x b additionally they view us inferior as i said earlier every race has built more than black men in the last years they subconsciously view us as a conquered men some even are aware of it black women resent that their only options are black men who they view as incompetent and inferior to not only every other group of men but women themselves amp x b additionally black women promote the cycle of bumhood even more by their early mating selections yes alphafux betabux yada yada yada but in our community it is an extreme in white communities alpha is an above average looking tall athletic charismatic dude who s fun to be around in our communities it is an extremely good looking gangbanger or entertainer with no trajectory towards success and no ambitions or someone who is already an entertainer rapper or athlete i have seen educated black women date choose to date absolute bums rather than be someone of their own socioeconomic status no white or asian woman over does that shit amp x b black women resent black men for all these reasons they constantly combat and belittle black men other races value men just for being men in our community a man has to be providing either a lot of money and status or be extremely good looking just to get a girl a man is not valued just for existing in our community even more so than in others our women don t value masculinity because they didn t grow up with it in our community where getting pussy and being a player is a large part of how your masculinity is defined experiences that the average white guy had at an average above average black guy will have to work extremely hard for the abuse and lack of love most black men experience from black women from a young age makes them believe they need to become these celebrities to get it and they spend years compensating for their lack of success with women young it causes them to chase dead end careers and waste time chasing pussy amplifying the baby mama issue and further driving us into poverty and perpetuating the cycle of our women and women of every other race hating us and men of other races not respecting us and fearing us amp x b our women didn t grow up with fathers and they don t value masculinity this causes them to on average be overly combative and have bad attitudes and go out of their way to antagonize men if i told you the way black women antagonize black men on campus and actively push for black men s organizations to be shut down you would be shocked some men are irresponsible and don t take care of their daughters making our community worse other times which is never talked about black men are pushed out of the home be it by the black women or the government like in the s regardless we need to return to being the head of households amp x b additionally the perceived undesirability of black women deeply hurts them and causes them to be antagonistic towards the men they believe hurt them part of it is their attitudes yes but as i said when black men get in power we do a terrible job of uplifting them black women are seen as the opposite of the beauty standard now every race has attractive and unattractive features some of it is pushed by society some of it is objective asians tend to have small and undimorphic bodies so the women are not thick whites have pale skin and thin hair and age poorly for black women the objective thing that hurts them is two things size black women tend to be fatter on average hair admittedly the afro hair texture is unattractive on women most black women wear weave to compensate for this but this is unattractive too they don t have to have long straight hair to be seen as attractive but the afro puff and weave isn t cutting it if they want to see examples of the way some attractive dark skin women style their hair naturally in a way that men of any race won t complain they can check out girls like biasonline on tiktok the rest of the healing the undesirability wound of black women is on us we have to shame the men who say shit like dark skin women are masculine ugly in public we have to do a better job uplifting and praising our women like literally every other group of men does we have to get in positions of power and promote ourselves as the beauty standard rather than letting white men dictate that for us they have to take care of their hair weight and attitudes better simple we have to become financially successful and be in positions of power not just for ourselves but so the rest of the world will respect us i hate the fact that every country ruled by people who look like me is impoverished and every other people notices this additionally because black men have not been leading our community black women have stepped up and done it for us this is a disaster black feminism is about antagonizing black men and making us equal which we all know will fail for our community see jordan peterson luxury beliefs we are the only community where the women make more money than the men it s a terrible look for us we need to promote masculine values like education hard work and discipline in our black boys and stop promoting black feminism and rappers who promote cultural degeneracy mostly we need to say no to our women black men because our community is so matriarchal spend so much time trying to appease black women we need to learn to say no to black women s demand that we be equal to them that we protect them unconditionally that we accept liberal ideals the same ideals that have destroyed our community black feminists often criticize black men saying they don t want equality they want to be patriarchs like the white man absolutely matriarchy is what we have now and when the black man gets his shit together and becomes the head of his household the black woman will thank us for it and fall in line amp x b men of other races to an extent of course build with their women and their women are their muse inspiring them to build and conquer in the black community our women antagonize us they have been brainwashed by the liberal media and want the black man to succumb to them they resent us they have had to deal with the pain and trauma of picking up the slack of leading our community where the black man should they shouldn t have to we will have to do the first part of this journey if we expect to raise our smv and improve our community alone building value by ourselves they will fall in line eventually amp x b a black man s options and what it says about us alexander grace a youtuber in the manosphere said the majority of his consultations were with black american men everything i said earlier is why they have such little options as i said earlier a black man has to be exceptional to get the results of the average white man yes i know black guys who do well for themselves but most of these guys are good looking tall athletic and have good careers ahead themselves where i m from average black men with average income or even above average settle for dumpster trash we are literally known by all races for taking obese white women bottom of the barrel gutter trash that no other man will take black male smv is so low that we regularly deal with unattractive women with bad attitudes multiple kids who are overweight that most other men wouldn t touch even men with above average income i rarely see an average looking black man with a good looking woman of any race even their own whereas i see this all the time with white men we are literally known as the men who are so low value that we will take any gutter trash unattractive low value woman that will fuck us we have to fix our image i m not saying the average black man can t get an attractive girl but i am saying it will be harder at least x harder this will be mitigated if you live in a liberal area but it is still a problem again i am not speaking in totality but i am speaking in generality amp x b why black men should care white men and sjws aren t coming to save us sjws are actively hurting us by enabling black women feminism black male smv being low is the cause of our communities being impoverished and shitty our low money and status causes all groups of people to disrespect and look down on us our perceived bad looks cause us to have to overcompensate for the same love a white man would get by improving our smv and working as a coalition of red pilled black men together we will directly improve our community and make life easier for black men as a whole the ultimate goal should be having popular black owned media to push a different image of the black man and black woman to influence our youth amp x b the interesting part at the end i have discussed a lot of hard truths on this post and i know i m going to be met with controversy i m ready for the quit whining quit racebaiting comments i m ready for the don t generalize not all black men not all white people view you as you sound like an incel blaming your race bro i m ready for the how dare you say asian guys have it easier hint asian owned media kpop and anime is increasing your smv atm and your women don t actively hate you amp x b there are even darker truths about the black community i won t discuss in this post but talking about this won t solve shit i ve talked too much in this post but i have been typing for fours and i m sure you ve seen the quality of this post decline with grammar and spelling errors i can t be fucked to look over as i drag on i have homework to do amp x b right now i am not a high value man i am a skinny college student with a bad work ethic and i am working to improve and become a high value man so i can be the change i want to see in society the solution isn t having conversations but what i want to do is build a community for black men who see the issue the same way i do and want to work to improve asians have subreddits like asian identity and trp is dominated by white guys who may not particularly care about the problem with our community i would like to just first build something like a discord server for young black men who want to improve and hold eachother accountable so we can become pillars of our community if you re interested i would love to see dms from yall and we can set something up i already know that most of the people here will downvote this post and call me a loser i don t fucking care if you agree with me reach out to me privately by dm or by comments i don t give a fuck how narcissistic this sounds i know i m going to change the black community and this is how i m going to do it start by changing myself and improve from there let me know if you share my vision black men and we can work to build each other up also i know i said lightskins mixed dudes might not suffer the same issues as us but yall are more than welcome to join up you are black too and still experience many of these problems on a day to day basis reach out to me if you want to have a community of black men building up other black men holding eachother acccountable and rising to the top of the social hierarchy thank you if you read this whole post
18484,your dick is a gift to women stop devaluing yourself this is something that has been weighing on my heart as of the past year or so it is also a realization that has forever cemented my sense of inner game and given me a certain level of both pride and peace not experienced prior that is that dick is a gift dick is not something to be freely given to women it is a luxury item and it is not something you simply give out when you are horny for your fwb your wife girlfriend or casual random dick is a prized possession and valued resource especially and more importantly good dick to be exact but that is neither nor there and is not the focus of this piece i only wish to provide factual information that will edify and uplift my brothers to make a quick distinction this is not about the virtues of having good dick good dick keeping girls around is obvious what i am on about is the virtues of not giving away your good dick for free i want to start by breaking this up into several descriptive principles that detail the nature of our gift to women let us begin by listing out said principles and then a brief explanation of each principle there is permanent scarcity for quality dick principle men are the ones who make sex good not women principle a woman cannot give away pussy but rather only receive dick principle good pussy is most often a result of men s low standards principle her orgasm is a gift to be given not something she wills into existence principle dick is to be rationed not timely or convenient amp x b principle there is permanent scarcity for quality dick i ve been with more than my fair share of women and once you get them comfortable provide them freedom from judgment they will pretty much tell you whatever you want to know on day one no later than day trauma skeletons and all that said i always conduct pre sex and post sex interviews with women i want to know how they want to take my dick and how if at all they want anything different i do not do this for any sort of validation but because i value a mutually fun experience and avoiding cases by crazy women you get more emotion vulnerability and control out of them this way and of course do you know what all of them tell me they say that guys suck in bed they say that men don t give a shit about their pleasure they say that when they try to tell a guy about what feels good to them the guy throws a bitch fit gets defensive and tries to waffle his way into talking her into just letting the sex flow they say that if they ve had an orgasm or cum it was only by one or two of the guys they were with they say men try to fuck them with a one size fits all style i could go on and on and i don t want to drag this out they say that the guy was awkward they say that they never feel comfortable enough to say no or stop the guy mid act if things aren t going well this is all to say that most women are sexually traumatized either from what they call assault to trash dick to bad listeners i also hear a lot that most guys are too afraid to indulge in whatever kinky act the woman wants i found this strange however i discovered this to be tied in with the same idea of men being afraid of correction and losing their dominance if it did not come from his mind it s just a woman trying to control him now this is not me saying to only focus on women s pleasure during sex truthfully i don t give a shit about their pleasure per se only that they had a fun time caring about their pleasure too much leads to both dominance and sexual anxiety issues what i am saying is that if you can do or currently do a few key things in the right way then she will be or is already scared of losing your dick that then begs the question if a man can learn to be good at sex then how could there be a permanent scarcity one most men aren t getting pussy and will stay this way because they will never be lucky enough to stumble upon helpful material like game pickup or the redpill two the ones that do get pussy either aren t good at it or aren t fucking often enough to get good at it three they don t know the right questions to ask a woman and don t have the skills to get her talking game four most men will always let their ego and pride rule them to wrap this up yes women like to be told what to do they like to be used for their bodies however in the grand scheme of what a woman needs to truly feel mentally dominated in a sexual capacity and turn her into a crazy person that relies on your dick as her sole purpose in life it isn t enough they need more it s not hard though so if you can or do currently do this you should not be fucking without some sort of payment from the woman for your gift this is leverage and power principle men are the ones who make sex good not women this point especially has been on my mind for probably the last two years after slaying girl after girl online i ve had a few who i would truly consider to be good pussy but even in obtaining good pussy which we will define later there came a point rather multiple points where i would burn out from it all i came to dread my next hookup coming to my place because i didn t have the mental energy to fuck them like i knew i could i didn t have any more cum to give i couldn t muster the mental energy to seduce to learn her to do foreplay etc and what i came to discover after a long internal audit was that i was giving away a valued service too often for free it wasn t due to a lack of break time it also wasn t just being tired or unfilled or them not being hot enough it was because although they would return twice to three times a week every week for the dick i was laying down and would enthusiastically fuck me back the work they put in could never really compare to the effort and value of mine being sexually dominant does take its toll on a man decision fatigue physical fatigue persona fatigue let s break it down and really analyze it for a second by virtue of being sexually dominant you exert action and by doing an action you exert energy and among energetic actions deciding what to do next is a primary killer absent being in a present mind state decision making not work are what really burns people out from completing various goals stopping them from winning in life it is also what saps willpower the tension of not knowing how to answer for the next moment next we have the physical component out of all the sexual positions all the variations what do women really like the most you ask any of them it s always doggy style followed by standing variations then it s some rough and aggressive version of missionary after that it s anyone s guess i ve never talked to a girl who said that riding dick was their one true calling there are those who have a true talent but in my observation it s few and far between i ve had many a woman ride my dick for a prolonged period only for them to tap out from the exhaustion of their hips and i m guessing their ass muscles and i say to myself nah i know there s more in you what does all of this mean it means that you are doing the bulk of the work every stroke you take in missionary s variations requires all of your body ass shoulders quads abs triceps etc it s a full body workout doggy is pretty much the same but easier and no i m not calling sex difficult i am merely explaining physical investment if you gas out and your heart s gonna explode from doing basic positions you need to get your cardio up and or see a doctor seriously but back to my point i think this physical investment is partially why besides being multiorgasmic and lacking a refractory period women are able to go so many rounds have them put in actual real work and they go to sleep a hell of a lot quicker all of this to say most of the good sex that women claim to want dominant and otherwise is gonna involve a majority of the work done by you tell me how doggy style is gonna work without a man moving his hips sure she can throw it back but that s not where a good pounding comes from that is merely a highlight of a good thrashing tell me how missionary and side positions really work without the man tell me how her favorite roleplay or bdsm scene works without hard direction from you sex good or mediocre cannot work without the man as the captain let s not forget that if a man s dick isn t hard nothing of value can happen whereas a woman if she needed to can use lube a woman can force herself to be wet whereas a man clouded in mindset cannot even with a cockring or viagra it can happen but is exceedingly difficult with screwy inner game men s leadership skills physical investment and masculine aura an act of action and not reception are what make sex good and finally the magical inverse relationship of a man withholding his ejaculate until a certain time and a woman trying to go towards her own good dick is a disciplined dick and she cannot live without it it s funny how a woman getting anywhere sexually or in life really depends on a man s self control dominance in all aspects dominate yourself to dominate others principle a woman cannot give away pussy but rather only receive dick in game we all know that a woman s role is not to create or build but to receive and multiply basics right so then we must apply this same logic to a woman s sexual habits if a woman is out hoeing on the streets she cannot give away pussy she can position herself to be penetrated but she still has to receive it she cannot give away what you think to be yours what you never owned for one if dick is a gift you therefore cannot own the pussy if dick was transactional making pussy transactional then you might be able to claim entitlement to it like so many weak men do you cannot give a gift and still own the actions of the recipient how then is it a gift it s like how beta male buy women gifts in hopes of secretly coercing them to stay and fuck them consequently you cannot hold a gift hostage then it is not a gift it s a manipulation tool a gift is earned through an individual providing value or showing they have the potential for value gift giving is an inspired act two good pussy comes from voluntary interactions with it where she wants to come out and play willingly she knows she could fuck a bunch of other dudes but chooses to stay and fuck with you moreover women receive dick it may wear them out but if you press them and they aren t too sore from the thrashing you give them they will almost always be able to take as much dick as you can throw at them they are like bottomless pits when it comes to getting fucked dick on the other hand is something that must be given it then by a woman must be received like a gift giving again is an action it is something that you hand down a woman taking dick is passive it requires no effort no real intention or forethought or planning even if she starts out on top she has to take not only your dick but hard dick and let s say you for some reason stupidly decide to nut in this chick now she is pregnant with a kid she likely will always love more than you and broadly generally speaking will almost always be able to make money from through the government friends gofundme and other internet campaigns absent the state and the kid has a good dad she is tied to that man for life and what is a man a man produces he creates he builds an empire and all she has to do is play her role properly and profit giving a woman dick is giving her access to the potential of a lifetime of prosperity and peace to give a woman dick is to give her a taste of the kingdom she never had i look at any woman who has my dick as one experiencing a fucking come up dick is a woman s pathway to happiness dick is a gift because it requires her to take from you something of value principle good pussy is most often a result of men s low standards i m going to go out on a limb and speak on another topic that is near and dear to my heart the good pussy you think you ve been getting is likely because you have zero standards for the women you have sex with okay she sucked your dick okay she did everything you wanted to in bed hit her spit on her pee on her choke her til you left marks etc and okay you came harder than you ever have in your entire life and you re on a dominance high that doesn t mean you got good pussy i will now attempt to define what good pussy truly is good pussy is pussy that comes not from her being her horny but from her seeking your validation and purpose within that you will never get better pussy than a woman who needs the validation of your dick and when i say i need it i mean they would become depressed suicidal mentally ill without it it would ruin their week if they didn t have it good pussy is that which comes from true sexual effort it s not just her being talented at what she does or being enthusiastic about it it is her saying to herself i am prepared to be sore for the next week and a half to give him the very best of me it comes not only from seeking validation from you but trying to impress you with her efforts good pussy and this one involves you is a result of being inspired and not necessarily horny for a woman what do i mean by this i think we as men let our dicks lie to us too much have you ever asked yourself why you were horny most likely it s because you either haven t had your daily fix you thought she looked good you re in scarcity you want your ego boosted it had absolutely nothing with her having to produce any real skills to get what she wanted i am essentially saying here that you guys get hard too easily you let her looking tight and right be enough for you you let her teasing you be enough for you you let her wearing a tight dress and high heels be enough you let her merely cooperating with what you want be enough for you it should not be when was the last time you were horny not because she pulled out a bunch of tricks or favors to present to you or because you were naturally horny but because she went out of her own way to tap into the depths of her feminine essence and seduce you fuck your mind i can tell you now a woman that is both feminine and a truly skilled seducer as in a seducer with intention is a rare rare thing and if you came across it it would really screw your head up and you wouldn t be able to function correctly you d probably become depressed and suicidal at a lower beta level because you were terrified at the thought of losing it why do i bring these points up i bring these points up because they should be the bare minimum the ideal for a woman to have access to your dick they are an offering good pussy is a woman doing things sexually for you that you didn t ask for or expect not only this but doing things that she has done for no other men good pussy is a woman that has a burning desire to be used by you what does all of this mean in full context again yes it is an offering to you but is much more than that good pussy is a woman acknowledging that the man is the head of the relationship interaction hookup and showing that with all of her being a woman who recognizes this also recognizes that good dick is inherently more valuable than good pussy why is that while good pussy is a powerful powerful force to be reckoned with good dick comes from the nature in which it arises it comes from sacrifice embarrassment humiliation trial and error deep study years of work experimenting an array of technical skills a profound shift in identity confidence based in identity and action leadership self control and more good dick comes from pressure and reproach in other words it comes from the profound journey that is masculinity it is quantifiable whereas good pussy comes from that childlike carefree essence that is femininity there is no force involved it only requires them to tap into and submit to the deepest parts of that feminine essence and be willing to learn on a final note good pussy if enacted in the way i describe above really implies that if she is to put that much effort into fucking you then she really can t afford to fuck other men than you or if she does not often it would take too much out of her i ve had women i m about to hook up with literally tell me that they can t fuck me because they are too sore and emotionally drained from getting pounded by a dude she saw days ago principle her orgasm is a gift to be given not something she wills into existence a common talking point i hear from women is that men get to cum all the time and it s not fair that women don t get to this is also a ridiculous talking point they use to guilt you when they don t get their way but if you don t see why i will break it down here is the basic difference women are always trying to find a way to cum whereas of men are breaking their back and their mind s focus trying to use every mental trick in the book not to cum cumming for a man is almost involuntary especially when you first start out it takes a fair bit of skill for most men not to cum in fact but you all know this already i m not going to lecture you all on what we all fucking know let s break it down further by discussing the power of a woman s orgasm have you ever seen a woman orgasm squirt or cum in general how their legs shake violently how they make that stupid scrunched up face like they re both pissed off and about to be murdered how afterwards they often lay on the bed like they re dead how they can literally black out and even pass out after how loud they yell when they re being genuine how you ever seen how pissed off a woman will get at you if they don t cum i have and let me tell you when a woman doesn t get to cum she turns into a total psychobitch their orgasm and capacity for pleasure is leagues beyond what us men can muster without skill they will literally cry after yes literally cry after and dramatically sulk about how close they were to cumming they will start arguments about how selfish you are for not giving them what they deserve they ll rush to another room or hell even stay in the room pull out a lipstick vibrator and go to town on themselves finishing themselves off they will in some extreme cases try to forcefully grab your dick and get it back hard if needed just to forcefully take it from you and try to cum it doesn t matter if you say no they do not care i ve had this happen to me more than a few times now imagine what would happen if a man were to act like this in or any time within the past years given our climate today he would be accused of being emotionally abusive he d be accused of sexual assault or rape depending on the facts of the case he d be told that a woman s body is not his and that he should respect her he d be told that his blue balls are fake and not her responsibility he should just learn self control they d call him creepy he d probably lose his job he might be killed by her brothers or some vigilante no exaggeration this is the power of a woman s orgasm and if they don t do any of the abovementioned they will at the very least walk around all day sulking and depressed like they were robbed for their purse i have never spoken to a woman who could orgasm that has not described her lack of orgasm as being robbed this is the power of a woman s orgasm and if they don t do any of the abovementioned they will at the very least walk around all day sulking and depressed like they were robbed for their purse i have never spoken to a woman who could orgasm that has not described her lack of orgasm as being robbed isn t that some shit it is this is why i say it is a gift not only is their orgasm more powerful than ours but it comes in a greater variety and has greater negative effects attached to its absence dick then is like medicine it is what literally keeps them sane and in working order it keeps them from becoming wild savages and if we have this much power to affect them why are we not treating our dick like a gift to be earned through good behavior to orgasm a woman must be led through the work of a man usually teaching her how to let go how to overcome her trauma depending on how heavy it is hitting it a specific way for a prolonged period of time or eating her out for a prolonged period with laser focus isn t it funny how women have to be taught how to orgasm and whose job is it to teach us men the greatest sexual pleasure they could ever receive will almost always undoubtedly come from the instruction patience discipline and guidance of a man principle dick is to be rationed not timely or convenient this brings me to our final point you cannot treat something as a gift if you give it away often or with expectation of frequency dick then should be rationed i ve had ex girlfriends and hookups call me selfish for not just giving them my dick they would become insecure and feel rejected sexually they would take that feeling of rejection and come at me with serious school shooter energy they would question my sexuality and if i was gay or not they would question if i was cheating all sorts of shit i broke not and to reiterate this isn t about how to develop this level of discipline but why you should my approach to this is simply to watch whatever girl i m with over the course of a week through text or when i hang out with them i analyze their behavior and everytime they fail to act submissively combatively or non cooperative i ding a little checkmark on the tally sheet of my mind i say to myself that s another day she isn t getting dick she isn t going to get xyz from me acting like that when they try to make a move on me sexually i look at them like they re crazy and vibe them out i don t tell them why i m not giving it to them if you tell them that gives them room to debate you and call you petty however women are not stupid they eventually rather quickly at that figure out that their behavior has a direct correlation with how often i put out it s not malicious it s not because i hate them it s not because i m on a power trip it s because my dick is a gift and i know that it has the power to change their mind and their life how can i give a woman that much power and peace and she can t be responsible with it many people would love to have a house or car just given to them but they never manage to ask about how they will maintain it basic budgeting and forecasting of expenses risk management contingencies redundancies etc i cannot give you this powerful gift if you cannot do the work to maintain it that would not be fair to them i cannot allow them to repeatedly frustrate themselves into psychobitch behavior that i am responsible for because they can t get their fucking act together that is why i ration dick to them rationing serves three purposes it reinforces that dick is a gift it forces them to check their bad behavior it forces her to respect the power of masculine principle she can t just get to the finish line and fuck the winner she has to look at the journey and respect it and the beautiful part of all of this is that if she doesn t respect your rationing process then she can go away you should only be dealing with women that submit to your program anyway if she doesn t recognize the gift of your penis in her mouth the gift of being given purpose by a man something which femininity craves which they all want in some way or another subconsciously then she can suffer out on the street with a dude who will give her what she wants
18548,intro i want you to imagine you re a year old kissless handholdless virgin you re not even that ugly you just couldn t figure it out for some reason even though you had decent looks good height rich parents and drove around in a bmw girls simply didn t you in fact they didn t want anything to do with you not even as a friend growing up your family knew that you were fucked up so they took you to therapist after therapist but nobody was able to help your dad was so cool that he even used his connections to arrange a one on one meeting between you and a local chad a successful hollywood writer to try to help you get laid that didn t work either what would you do in this situation this was the reality for a young man named elliot rodger and his response was to go on a mass murder spree killing people and injuring others by shooting them stabbing them or running them over in his car by the way the part about his dad arranging a meeting with the hollywood screenwriter who wrote my cousin vinny is completely true crazy stuff amp x b gt you forced me to suffer all my life now i will make you all suffer i waited a long time for this gt gt elliot rodger elliot rodger the founding martyr of the incel movement was one fucked up dude what s particularly interesting about him on a psychological level is that he somehow found a way to blend psychopathy narcissism and autism all into just one person psychologists refer to it as comorbidity where more than one mental illness is present in the same person which in elliot rodger s case simply led to a failed human being he had the poor social skills and social awareness of autism the utter lack of empathy of psychopathy combined with the grandiose yet deeply insecure ego of a narcissist i d argue that given how society tried to force feed him typical normie advice despite all his fucked up personality disorders elliot rodger never had a chance for him it really was already over before it began but it doesn t have to be for you the goal of this post is to construct an individual guide to each different common personality type so you don t waste time spinning your wheels following advice that simply won t work for you keep in mind that all of these personalities are present to some degree in everyone it s like a color mixer everyone has different levels of psychopathy narcissism autism mixed in the only difference is the degree most people have a primary personality type but a lucky few have comorbidity like elliot rodger not every personality style grows or achieves success in the same way so it s very important to identify yours early so you can optimize your results neurotypical if you grew up with a close circle of friends that you re still in contact with today if you generally like the same things that normal people like football happy hour popular netflix shows then consider yourself blessed seriously nowadays hollywood tv shows and entertainment tend to paint an unrealistic picture that in order to be successful you have to have psychopathic personality traits and that if you actually have empathy you ll never be able to outcompete those who are willing to do whatever it takes to win here s what happens in the real world having empathy is like being born a native speaker of a difficult foreign language that everybody else struggles with when they try learning it at as an adult you ll have natural intuition about social situations and won t need to constantly analyze or scheme out situations in your head in order to get ahead since you re relying on feel rather than analysis because of this head start over other personality types you naturally had no problem forming friendships growing up and managed to keep most of those relationships intact over the years since you have a natural aversion to fucking people over for personal gain getting a girlfriend should have happened naturally while you were in high school amp college in case it didn t results come quickly and easily from simply reading the red pill sidebar and not being a lazy fuck most advice is catered towards normies because by definition most people are neurotypical all you have to do is simply get off your lazy ass and actually do it actually create a schedule and start lifting actually start tracking macros and making sure you get enough protein in every day actually asking out the girl that you have a crush on actually escalating to sex instead of being too much of a pussy to make a move and things should improve really quickly biggest obstacles to success with women not moving fast enough typically neurotypicals have no trouble meeting prospective girlfriends through friends or simply from dating apps but they always make the same mistake of not moving quickly enough you think that relationships will develop naturally over time like they did in high school and college but the truth is after college most great long term relationships start with sex adults typically get into relationships after hooking up over and over again and developing feelings for each other not by going on dates and then finally having sex if your goal is to have an amazing relationship with the woman of your dreams you re going to have to come to terms with the fact that the highest chance of success will come if you have sex with the girl as early and often as possible by having sex often the woman will start chasing you for a relationship instead of the other way around which almost never works not being able to let go of toxic relationships this is the main downfall of empathy neurotypicals get absolutely destroyed by toxic women women with borderline personality disorder or other cluster b traits the empathy makes it impossible for the neurotypical to walk away from a toxic relationship which ironically is what you should be doing in the first place to make toxic women to actually chase you instead of the other way around the important thing to remember is if a stock isn t performing you d drop it in a heartbeat but for some reason you have no problem investing time resources and emotional energy on a woman who you know deep down in your heart is no good for you long term feeling guilty or embarrassed all the time one of the biggest weaknesses as a neurotypical is that you ll often keep the same social circle even as you start to achieve success yourself you have a hard time letting go of people who are holding you back you also have an extremely difficult time intruding on other peoples boundaries to get what you want like cold approaching a girl for sex the truth is you don t need to feel guilty if you go for what you want you especially don t need to feel guilty when you cut out old friends who are holding you back from reaching your full potential and yes there is a chance the girl is going to think they re a creep if you cold approach her but pushing through that fear is so critical to getting that fulfilling relationship you want getting too complacent in a relationship not being able to maintain attraction in a long term relationship by being too boring a lot of neurotypicals love living a simple life with no long term plans or vision for the future except being happy unfortunately this puts them at a disadvantage compared to other personality types like narcissists and psychopaths who often have more grandiose ambitions that pull a woman in and capture her imagination neurotypicals simply don t have the ego insecurity of a narcissist to want to get famous or the greed and lust for power of a psychopath so they are much more likely to just settle into a comfortable life trying to live a lifestyle based on what society wants instead of what you want based on every neurotypical i ve spoken to i d estimate that around of neurotypical men have the end goal of getting into a passionate meaningful long term relationship with an amazing woman they don t need to have plates spinning at the same time or to engage in hedonistic sex with a bunch of sloots to be fulfilled however because that s the image painted by society about what constitutes a successful man some neurotypicals get caught in the trap of trying to live up to society s expectations instead of going for what they want which is a deep connection and meaningful emotional relationship with just one woman not looking as good as you could most men dress like shit if you re going to put in the effort to go to the gym every day then why wouldn t you take less than minutes every day to put on an outfit and do your hair so you can be proud of the way you look every time you go outside appearance is the very first thing people judge you by it makes perfect sense to maximize it as much as possible how to succeed with women as a neurotypical the biggest strength of a neurotypical is long term networking and the ability to leverage friends to meet women organically in short as gay as it sounds the power of friendship fastest way to improve with women move faster than you think modern dating in the adult world is all about speed you can have the deepest connection with a woman but until you sleep with her you re just another dude if you want to actually lock down a girl you really like for a relationship sleep with her as early and as often as possible without that you literally have nothing of value with her and you ll get heartbroken when she gets together with someone else who actually isn t scared to move fast a neurotypical needs to realize that sleeping with a woman as soon as possible is the most efficient way towards getting into a deeply fulfilling relationship since it prevents you from wasting time and mental space on girls who are simply not into you but too polite to let you know narcissist next up we have the narcissist if you constantly feel the need to exaggerate your talents or accomplishments if you require excessive admiration from others and feel like absolute dogshit if you ever get rejected if you are often jealous of others who you feel like you should be better than but are somehow in higher positions if you just can t resist defending yourself and your ego whenever you get attacked then congratulations you re a narcissist as a narcissist your ego is extremely fragile due to low self confidence the bragging the need to defend your ego all come as a defense mechanism against getting your ego hurt fortunately while other men can t stand dealing with narcissists women don t seem to mind in fact guys who are primarily narcissist dominant in personality tend to enjoy the most success with women out of any other personality type because you re so insecure and care so much about what other people think about you you learned from a very early age to either looksmax by always dressing and looking your best or by cultivating talents that can easily be demonstrated in a large crowd for social proof this often results in you getting results with women at an early age compared to other men these quick results ultimately lead to more early encouragement which means that you re going to be more likely to stick with seduction game compared to other men with longer learning curves for the most part because modern society is so heavily looks focused any effort spent maximizing looks is time well spent and narcissists simply have a huge leg up over the psychopath neurotypical and autistic types simply by grasping this very important concept another side effect of caring so much about what other people think is a higher than average attention to details this is a trait that not only leads to success with women but also leads to success in life so much of success in business is simply catching the right details about what will become the next trend before it actually becomes the next trend so much of success with women is simply making sure that you maximize your first impression by making sure that your looks body language vocal tonality and social skills are on point right from the beginning which the narcissist either does well at an early age or is in the process of doing well since they care so much about what others think about them now let s get to some drawbacks of this personality type biggest obstacles to success with women indecisiveness narcissists can t stand the idea of failure in any aspect in business they ll be afraid to lose money even if there is a far greater reward if things work out with girls they ll be scared to death to say the wrong thing and get rejected leading to a lot of them adopting a slow play strategy with girls where they always have to wait for the next date or the next opportunity with a girl instead of going for the kill lack of work ethic most narcissists i ve met are not capable of grinding for long periods of time in any field that involves rejection without getting burnt out their ego simply can t handle the no s with women just like in sales volume often beats skill you can be the best salesman in the world but if a psychopath grinds x harder than you and makes x the number of approaches calls as you it doesn t matter if you re x better than him in skills he ll still get better results poor social circle game as stated before while girls don t mind narcissists other guys can t stand you you ll have a difficult time forming real friendships and thus will most likely not be able to leverage social circle game to get easy layup results with women compared to neurotypicals the key is to transition to a more covert style of narcissism where you gradually learn to hide how you really feel from those around you yeah yeah i get it you feel so insulted whenever someone even makes a slight hint of attacking you in public but in most circumstances it s smarter and more effective to pretend to befriend the person than making a big show of defending your ego and making everyone dislike you easily manipulated a narcissist is the easiest personality type to manipulate simply give them genuine compliments and they won t be able to resist as a narcissist you should be aware that oftentimes when people make you feel really good about yourself it s because they re getting something from you that personal trainer you hired who tells you you re a natural at the gym probably manipulating you to get money that girl who lives with you rent free but showers you with compliments every day probably manipulating you to get a free place to stay as a narcissist you d do anything for narcissistic supply which means that people who provide it often have power over you without you knowing how to succeed with women as a narcissist the biggest strength of a narcissist is an obsessive focus on looks combined with higher than average attention to details in short the power of looksmaxing fastest way to improve with women get organized and set up a daily routine of hitting a certain amount of approaches no matter what narcissists typically already have all the tools to become absolute killers with women the only thing holding them back is fear of rejection and obsessing that every detail has to be perfect instead of just grinding narcissists typically get results really really quickly whenever they are on a set routine that they follow no matter what whether it s gym girls or money because they naturally pay attention to crucial details that other personality types miss and have the ability to make adjustments to fit other people s needs what a narcissist needs to realize is that in any area of life whether it s business or women consistency beats brilliance over the long term doesn t matter what you re doing if you re not consistent and give up on things when they get hard and can no longer feed your narcissistic supply you won t make it in any endeavor long term a narcissist really starts to take off when they either force themselves to cultivate incredible self discipline or better yet find something they re so passionate about that they never lose interest even in the hard times when they don t get the praise they re dying to get from others psychopath next up we have the psychopath the coolest personality type to be today based on what the media tells you do you do extremely well under pressure when most people would crumble under stress do you go to sleep every night feeling absolutely no guilt regardless of how many people you fucked over that day do you just straight up feel like you re superior to everyone around you even if there s no objective proof are you straight up unaffected by rejection to the point where you can get times in a row by women you cold approach with zero negative psychological consequences do you really not give a fuck about other people but always felt like you were clever or cunning enough to manipulate others into thinking you cared about them do you straight up feel no deep emotions whatsoever never ever get depressed and can only generate shallow emotions like anger if so you re a psychopath as a psychopath you have one quality that no other personality type can ever hope to match and that s consistency when you set your mind on something come hell or high water you re going to get it it doesn t matter how many people get hurt around you hell it doesn t even matter what kind of pain you yourself go through you ll get what you want or die trying all of this combined with a lack of emotional response to positive or negative events compared to everyone else means that you can grind for extended periods of time without losing motivation or burning out you re the one personality type that can actually approach girls a day for an entire year you re the one personality type that can actually do cold calls a day without giving a fuck about getting rejected and oddly enough psychopaths do extremely well in long term relationships since they naturally follow the principle of least interest whoever has the least amount of interest in continuing a relationship has the most power over it since you truly don t give a fuck about anyone except for yourself there s no need to even fake not being interested in other people it s simply who you really are and unfortunately that s where the positives end you see most psychopaths don t end up achieving any kind of success like in the movies you may think that being a psychopath makes you a future ceo since herp derp ceo is the profession with the most psychopaths you may even think that worst comes to worst you can become a criminal since the prison population is full of psychopaths but what really ends up happening is that just like everyone else you ll most likely just end up as an ordinary person with an ordinary job and ordinary prospects with women you re not special the only difference is because you don t feel empathy you had a much harder learning curve growing up compared to others when it comes to social awareness that being said because you deeply value money and power you most likely realized that in order to get both you have to learn social skills to blend in either you went through that blending in process successfully at an early age or you didn t if you didn t you end up with a borderline autistic adult who has no friends and isn t particularly good at anything but who thinks he s the greatest at whatever he touches usually something involving vidya games also while having extraordinary persistence and determination is generally a very good quality to have it s borderline useless if you combine it with a lack of attention to details and an inability to make adjustments when necessary every single time without fail whenever i talk to someone who has made cold approaches but failed to get laid once it s a psychopath a psychopath is one of the only personality types who will be retarded enough to try the exact same thing times or even times in a row without making any adjustments whatsoever they somehow believe the world should conform to them instead of the other way around with this kind of attitude not only do you make zero progress from all this hard work of going out and getting rejected but you actually make negative progress since you re ingraining bad habits into your memory that will be extremely difficult to undo later on as a psychopath you genuinely believe that you re superior to other people yet all this does it lead to a it s good enough attitude to everything you do your appearance ends up looking careless and disheveled because oh well whatever i wear is good enough you walk up to girls times get rejected times and don t even stop to consider that it might be because you didn t take the time to put on a nice outfit and get a trendy haircut before going out hell you probably didn t even take time to analyze your mistakes from a game perspective instead all you do is move on to the next approach like a robot because who gives a fuck about rejection all you need to do is make enough approaches a lay is right around the corner right here are some of the biggest shortcomings holding psychopaths back from success with women not giving a fuck about appearance for some reason every other personality type at least understands that you need to put some basic effort into physical appearance before you go out to approach women even incels realize the importance of looks yet psychopaths love to get sucked into weird theories that you can seduce any woman if your game is good enough and that looks don t matter fact of the matter is you can be don juan reincarnated in it doesn t fucking matter you re not getting laid on a consistent basis if you go out wearing whatever feels comfortable instead of looking your best simply getting a proper haircut that s faded on the sides and back and wearing layered outfits will yield immediate improvements in the way people respond to you you spend all this time learning about seduction or manipulation techniques like law of power or passing shit tests why the fuck wouldn t you invest time and energy into the one thing that actually counts most for success with women your appearance the way forward is to be more like patrick bateman less like ariel castro every single time without fail whenever someone complains to me that they made approaches and only got laid once it s always a psychopath or autistic personality type since no other personality type would even have the patience to go through that much rejection for such little results lack of conscientiousness because you don t give a fuck about what other people think of you you re less likely to care about the quality of your work when you re delivering projects to clients or taking care of your appearance before you go out to approach girls it goes without saying but you ll never succeed in any area of your life whether is working out building a business or with women if you don t care about whether or not you do a quality job and simply think everything you do is good enough lack of attention to details another huge problem with the psychopathic personality type is that important details are often neglected due to brain wiring things that other people catch immediately are simply not even noticed by the psychopath if the girl is feeling scared neurotypicals or even narcissists can sense it and will make a comment to diffuse the tension meanwhile the psychopath keeps running his shitty version of game over and over again not giving any fucks what the girl is feeling which eventually leads to yet another rejection ego too high to learn from people who may be trying to help you as a psychopath you ve never experienced a moment of imposter syndrome you have the opposite problem thinking you already know everything and that they know better than other people the truth is while most people are as useless as you imagine there are a few who know significantly more about women or making money than you could ever hope to achieve the fastest way to get better at anything is through a mentor the sooner you can temporarily let go of your ego and reach out for help from the right places the sooner you can actually start getting results instead of doing the same thing over and over again and getting nowhere monotone delivery because you feel less emotions than others you don t really convey any sort of emotion in your voice either unlike other people where there s a range of loud and quiet high and low your voice is monotone as fuck it s like you re speaking in black and white while others are speaking in color since you lack empathy it also never occurred to you that in a noisy environment like on the streets for a cold approach you have to talk x louder and x slower than normal so the other person can actually understand what you re saying instead of constantly saying what in fact this might be thing easiest thing you can test for yourself right now as a psychopath go out and talk x louder and x slower than normal and you should see an immediate improvement in the way other people respond to you overconfidence attributing any success to inherent greatness instead of doing the work psychopaths usually do a terrible job of analyzing mistakes or analyzing victories not because they re inherently bad at it but because they don t even bother they simply don t replay events in their mind like a neurotypical or narcissist would they go to sleep every night without a care in the world every success is because they re inherently great every failure eh who gives a fuck on to the next victim what psychopaths need to realize is that no one is fundamentally great great results are achieved by hard work and because someone caught important details that most other people were not aware of failures happen for the opposite reason not putting in enough work or doing the wrong actions and taking the wrong advice aka catching the wrong details one of the best ways to improve is to simply journal every day as gay as it sounds since it allows you to go over your mistakes and victories so you don t repeat mistakes over and over again how to succeed with women as a psychopath the biggest strength of a psychopath is relentless consistency you don t experience the ups and downs that other personality types do make sure you re actually using that quality to your advantage instead of wasting time on petty schemes or playing vidya games all day starting out you may get rejected quite a lot simply because of appearance take time to really nail it and remember that it s not about what you think looks good it s about what girls think don t be afraid to reach out for help from others who have what you want if someone else has really good fashion and has a lot of girls interested in him try to bring them on as a mentor it s far easier than you think because people love feeling like experts simply implement whatever they tell you to do and report back with results guaranteed the mentor will be absolutely thrilled because of people take advice and don t do anything with it recognize that even though you may have to approach more girls and have a steeper learning curve than every other personality type you ll have significant advantages once you actually lock in a plate or long term relationship girls may be creeped out by you when you first approach them since they can tell something is off about you but as soon as you fuck a girl enough times she ll be your little puppet to do whatever you want with they won t be able to escape because you don t give a fuck about them so you have all the power my final bit of advice for psychopaths out there is that almost all of the mainstream self help stuff out there is not just useless for you it s actively harmful your problem was never about not having enough confidence or not knowing your own value your problem is the complete opposite being an overconfident fuck who overvalues himself and his own abilities all reading self help books will do is make you love the smell of your own farts instead of actually finding a mentor who will correct all those mistakes you re making so you can actually go to the next level on a final note you may think you re cunning as fuck and that nobody can see through your mask but i d say for of psychopaths i ve ever met everyone can see right through them really take time to analyze how people respond to you if you never get promoted or offered leadership positions at work and have no long term friends just a series of short term acquaintances then that means you have a shitty mask everyone can see right through you so it s time to really analyze what you re doing wrong so you can actually achieve the kind of success you dream about the way forward is to divorce your ego from the results you re not great because of your the biggest strength of a neurotypical is long term networking and the ability to leverage friends to meet women organically in short as gay as it sounds the power of friendship autist do people around you get weirded out because you can t keep eye contact or have weird body language or facial expressions that don t make sense do you have obsessive interests in obscure fields that you go full tunnel vision on do you absolutely have to follow certain routines even if they make no logical sense like making sure to clap your hands a certain way to spin in a circle whenever a specific action happens to you if so congratulations you may be autistic this post is already way too long as i was writing the autist section came out to pages of advice and observations i truly put my heart and soul into this because i know a lot of people with autism who struggle with girls and don t have any resources to point them in the right direction least of all from mainstream normie advice therefore i ve uploaded everything you need to know if you fit into this personality type into a trp red post that you can access here link to page document about how to improve as an autist gt lol just kidding there s no hope if you re an autist it s over for you before it even began my only serious advice would be to follow all of the psychopath advice since their path to improvement is about the same as yours just yours will be even harder since you have naturally weird body language lt conclusion i truly hope nobody on this subreddit goes elliot rodger i know that there s plenty of people wallowing in depression or stuck on an endless loop putting in effort but getting very little results i was totally joking about autism i ve seen plenty of people with autism or aspergers overcome their weaknesses through relentless self analysis and help from others if you have comorbidity more than one personality disorder at the same time read through both as you ll most likely need to implement strategies from both in order to truly take off and get results always remember that you have natural strengths that your personality type allows you to tap into in times of greatest need the greatest strength of a neurotypical is the ability to leverage long term relationships this is why most millionaires are neurotypicals since the other personality types have a hard time building a team that works together towards a common goal the greatest strength of a narcissist is attention to detail you just knew how important things like appearance social status and cultivating attention grabbing talents were from an early age so you most likely got laid way before all the other personality types the greatest strength of a psychopath is relentless consistency the ability to go after what you want without giving a fuck about who gets in the way or gets hurt in the process even if it s yourself that gets hurt that kind of consistency is extremely potent when combined with a more humble approach that actually goes over what went wrong each time instead of mindless grinding the greatest strength of an autist is that you can hyperfocus on or narrow fields of interest and tunnel in a way no other personality type will ever catch up in that field better make sure that field is something you can make money in like computer programming whenever you feel too discouraged remember that it can always be worse and that you could have more than personality disorders at the same time amp x b gt one time as i was walking across the huge bridge that connected the two campuses i passed by a girl i thought was pretty and said hi as we neared each other she kept on walking and didn t even have the grace to respond to me how dare she that foul bitch i felt so humiliated that i went to one of the school bathrooms locked myself in a toilet stall and cried for an hour gt gt elliot rodger
18562,i m back for another controversial thread this one is extremely fucking edgy to the point where even i cringed sometimes when i read it back nonetheless i will post it anyway because i think it offers valid information despite the edginess forgive me if there s a lot of typos i have been up hours studying for exams and i am going to pass out right after i type this but this is something i ve been thinking about a lot lately so i wanted to get it out there while i was inspired to write this took me over hours to write and i wrote the intro last so forgive me if the quality decreases as i go along but i m actually very excited to hear the responses both positive and negative on this post amp x b intro to this topic as i grow up begin my career and begin the transition into the corporate and professional world i m really starting to see the importance of one s social status not just for love but for career i d argue social status is just smv looks money status game how you can game women and social skills how well you handle platonic interactions social status is largely just a semi interchangeable but broader encompassing term than smv in my opinion amp x b as i grow up and see many people i personally know have their startups funded by billionaires raising millions in one round of funding see people getting offered figure jobs right out of college as well as seeing people much smarter than i get blacklisted and essentially bullied out of industries struggle to get by and live a worse life than i do despite working harder i am realizing one thing life isn t as much about what you know or even how hard you work as it is about who you know and how you re perceived you piss off the wrong person and they can destroy your reputation and career you befriend the right people and they can make you a millionaire this is why i think it is very important to discuss the kind of content i am going to discuss in this post your social status is incredibly important in dictating your life outcome in this post i am not even disagreeing with traditional redpill wisdom in regards to lifting and self improvement but i will add to the social and platonic realm there are two reasons your social status is important being high status puts you in the same spheres as high status men these men will significantly improve your career prospects allow you access to women you couldn t get as an ordinary man and boost your testosterone life is a giant feedback loop the more you have the easier it is to get more the less you have the harder it is to get more therefore being high status will grant you high status things better women better jobs more opportunities in life and an overall happier life of course everything has diminishing returns i doubt making billion dollars a year will make you significantly happier than making million a year women are attracted to high status people talk about gaming women but the truth is of game is done before you even talk to a woman women love the guy who s high status the guy who s the leader of his peers the guy who knows everyone at the bar in every friend group and social group there is a male hierarchy there is the man who functions as the unspoken leader of the group then there is the one everyone clowns on and bullies woman can spot these two men immediately and they are enthralled by the first and repulsed by the second i ve seen multiple women talk about this and gravitate toward the natural leader type amp x b many men might say hurrr durr you idiot this is so complicated it s feminine this is autistic to be this concerned with your social status i m a red pill alfalfa i just lift and shave my head bald and get all the bitches brahhhhh amp x b i ve given enough reasons social status is important and will not address this further amp x b but what s the most low status thing you can be in any male group someone who gets bullied it reeks of weakness and will repulse everyone around you and how can you boost your own status by bullying others and in this post we will discuss how that works after all half of you are being have been bullied before i m betting because if you were some chad slaying all the puss you wouldn t probably wouldn t be browsing this sub amp x b many men do not understand basic social interaction and social hierarchy whereas women understand it inherently so this will be a post where i break it down a bit young men today lack social competence we need to understand why certain non sexual interactions occur but not from a blue pill everything will be alright lens but from a redpill lens that will tell the harsh truths the truths most people know deep down but are afraid to admit out loud amp x b what is bullying quite simply it s a form of peacocking what is the definition of bullying the best definition i found online comes from the national centre against bullying s website it is defined as such amp x b bullying is an ongoing and deliberate misuse of power in relationships through repeated verbal physical and or social behaviour that intends to cause physical social and or psychological harm it can involve an individual or a group misusing their power or perceived power over one or more persons who feel unable to stop it from happening amp x b so why do people bully others society would have you believe aphorisms such as hurt people hurt people and every bully is also a victim most bullies are sad abused people hurting inside who don t know any better and take it out on others right wrong psychologists were shocked to find out bullies actually have significantly higher self esteem and better mental health than bully victims on average in high school no most psychologists thought this can t be true it also turns out that bullies in middle and high school bullies in high school go on to live healthier end up more successful and are considered more attractive and have better dating lives so it turns out that that old stereotype of the high school nerd who was bullied and becomes a successful business man while the jocks who bullied him end up old ugly divorced and alone is actually untrue revenge of the nerds is a fantasy after all but anyone with two brain cells that s about twice what most people in have who paid attention in life already knew this i know the blue pillers reading this must be shocked but no one here reading this should be amp x b so then why do people especially men bully well the reason men and women bully is actually pretty similar but i won t cover that in today s wall of text men bully others to assert their dominance superiority and hence showing off and improving their status bullying is fundamentally a misuse of power when you bully someone publicly you are showing others that you are superior your victim because you have the power to get away with it and your victim can t really stop it whether it be physical strength if he tries to do something about it i can just physically intimidate him social strength i m so popular that if he tries to do anything about it everyone else will gang up on him on my behalf or intellectual strength my tongue is a lot sharper than his so if he insults me back he knows he ll get roasted or even other types of strength like financial or positional you are showing the world that you are more powerful than your bully on a primal level in a man power irregardless of whether he uses it for good or bad is deeply attractive people will try to virtue signal about how no one likes an asshole but it s simply untrue i wish i could find them for this thread but i have even seen tiktoks of women directly admitting they got turned on by watching their boyfriends bully other inferior men and pretending like she wanted him to stop again why do you think bullies are seen as significantly more attractive amp x b background amp x b on an instinctual level everyone here knows what i m saying is true subconsciously but i ll never forget the tweenage moments that made me consciously understand what i m saying is true amp x b me in middle school i was actually bullied quite a bit in middle school that s right i am admitting i have been bullied inb omgggg hurt zoomer trying to write an edgy post hurrr durrrr i uplift other men hurrrrrrrrr durrrrrrrrr amp x b i was always significantly younger than other kids in my class so i lacked the social skills the older kids had so i was picked on a lot what i did have though is i was bigger than them i was shy and let myself get picked on a lot i tried to participate in verbal exchanges to defend myself which i quite frankly did not have the wit to win this all changed on two different occassions amp x b one kid in my class looking back this was so dumb by i was already well over feet and he was would always try to fake flinch like he was going to beat me up and i was actually legitimately scared of him for some reason i just didn t really get how much bigger i was than kids my age i guess one day he tries it and while flinching and flailing my arms like an autist i accidentally smack him in the face he falls over everyone starts laughing at him and instantly people start being nicer to me the guys in my class respect me significantly more in th grade kids thought it was a funny idea to break my shit i just let them do it for the longest when one ended up breaking an heirloom from my dad after school for the first time i got so mad that i dragged him out the in the middle of the parking lot and knocked him on the ground and just started pounding on him after that he was left on the ground bruised and do you know what happened i m not even joking a bunch of underclassmen girls in fact all the ones who saw the event came up to me started offering their number to me asking me if i was okay etc while completely ignoring the guy lying on the ground crying hypergamy is that brutal if we acted strictly by our ape genetics and lizard brains a woman would watch another man kill her husband get turned on by it and end up in bed with him minutes later i m by no means saying that all or even most women today would do that but i m telling you that deep down in your lizard brain hypergamy and other visceral instincts that are natural to men and women are that brutal tr amp x b anyway after experience number two it would be only a few days before i went from being the number one bully target to the talk of my school but it would be many years i came up with a theory and practiced it on how to use this knowledge with intention it taught me that strength power attractiveness and competence are what is seductive about a man no matter how he uses it amp x b a warning amp x b human s innate animalistic obsession with powerful dominant men the reason why we have aphorisms like hurt people we want to imagine that high school bully that asshole at the office who kills it in sales every quarter your older brother who picked on you as a kid did it because deep down they were a scorned abused and deeply misunderstood in reality they did it because it gave them power hurt people hurt people is an example of the halo effect we attribute reasons to the bully that quite frankly don t exist because how could someone we like and admire so much just be a bad person in the worst cases the victim who does not get the halo treatment gets the just world fallacy where we make up reasons that the victim deserves it because i like the bully because he is powerful the victim disgusts me because he is weak so then in our collective heads we make the victim out to be a bad person and the bully out to be a good person who is punishing him for his immorality because that s the way we justify in our head being friends and enjoying the behavior of someone who is doing something wrong do not fall into this delusion if you use the techniques i will describe later in this post or you risk overdoing it and then you yourself being seen as a bad person just understand what you re doing is a technique to boost your social status nothing more nothing less it may sound immoral but remember the red pill is an amoral set of tools for people to use amp x b bullying is just peacocking you are showing off your power as man to dominate other men and thus bossting your status don t treat it as anything more or get such an overblown ego that you overdo it and it turns on you i ve made this mistake before it s a power exchange when monkeys fight over who will be the alpha male the winner gets a boost of testosterone and the loser drops this is an evolutionary mechanism to create a feedback loop that causes the winner to become more aggressive to gain more status and reproduce more similar to the fight response as testosterone promotes status seeking behavior the losing monkey drops in testosterone which decreases his drive to be aggressive or engage in status seeking behavior this keeps the losing monkey safe because at least he does not risk embarassing himself or even worse dying in a fight so he can at least survive another day testosterone in human men also behaves similarly to this wins like having sex getting a promotion working out and yes i theorize bullying boosts testosterone which overtime makes a man more attractive whereas losses obviously have the opposite effect amp x b it s a simple energy exchange think of it as siphoning their testosterone now that i ve covered all the background let s talk about the techniques amp x b how to bully part why are people targeted what all bully victims have is that they are low social status relative to the environment they re in for an example a indian at an all white workplace would almost certainly be low status unless he was other strengths significant enough to compensate for his low social value whereas if he goes to india he doesn t stand out there are many different reasons someone can be low status it also varies from situation to situations we all have our strengths and weaknesses for example my strengths are that i tend to be socially charismatic and very intelligent so in a social setting or career i would be a higher status person people would seek to be around me and look for my advice but i have never been very athletic so in athletic situations like playing pickup or working out with friends i quickly become lower status the the point where i almost become the inferior a victim type i will talk about later people would avoid passing me the ball or when i was in middle school throw me passes i can t catch to watch me fumble now this is too also say only bully low status people these are the people who can t really do anything back because they don t have the social ground to stand on if you bully high or even medium status people you risk people caring enough about that person to care that you re being mean to them thus you will get called out and look like an asshole i will describe how to identify the types of low status people in the next couple of sections in general there are two types of them as i see it the inferior and the hated amp x b bully victim the inferior the inferior is low status because in general he is perceived as socially low value due to some amalgamation of characteristics he happens to have maybe he is some combination of short ugly awkward introverted poor bad social skills unathletic stupid uneducated balding fat scrawny irresponsible undisciplined boring or any other combinations of traits that cause him to be low social value socially undesirable as i said earlier deep down there is a halo effect that makes us love strong dominant men no matter what they do or say as i also said a reverse halo effect exists when we see weak men we have disdain for them the inferior does not inspire a deep seething hatred that the hated does he is just so inferior that he just registers on most people s radar as an annoyance he is the oofy doofy friend in the group everyone teases he is the friend you send to run errands for the group he is the friend that if he left the group no one would really care the inferior is just a mild annoyance and picking on him offers mild comic relief amp x b bully victim the hated the hated is a significantly more interesting type than the inferior the hated inspires a strong dislike and seething hatred towards everyone in the group everyone in the social circle talks negatively about the hated avoids being friends with him and in worst cases outright insult him to his face or even physical violence the inferior may not know he is inferior whereas the hated almost always does but how does one become the hated in human society whether someone is objectively a bad person or objectively did anything wrong is rarely the true reason why someone becomes the hated humans naturally need people to get behind and people to fight against an us vs them mentality is hard wired into our brains and being part of an us makes us feel good fighting against a them makes us feel even better so in the absence of a true us vs them we make rally behind the strong and we make one if we did actually hated people for objectively being bad people most of our politicians and celebrities wouldn t have jobs rather someone becomes the hated for a multitude of the reasons that follow but are not limited to someone of lower status in the group angers someone of higher status in the group this person of higher status with higher social strength will then go and rally hatred against the person who angered them and thus making them the new hated person of the group an example would be donald trump versus the media it is possible to be so utterly inferior that people s mild annoyance of you becomes visceral hatred usually this is also coupled with bad social skills an example is big ed in day fiance it is possible to just be such an asshole that everyone hates you this is usually not the case but it is possible but if you re the right kind of asshole people will love it i e simon cowell you stand out too much you are too different from everyone else and it scares people people can t relate to you you want to stick out just enough so people view you as a leader but not so much people can no longer relate to you when people loose the ability to empathize with you that is when you become the hated there is a saying in japan the nail that sticks out gets hammered down an example of this would be t pain when he started pioneering autotune in rap imagine everyone comes to work in a white shirt and jeans and you come in lady gaga s meat suit you would immediately be targeted there are many more reasons someone can become hated but those are the most common ones i can think of we ascribe to the hated a type of moral destitution one that makes him seem to us like the worst person in the world the hatred is made to be the ultimate evil in the minds of the social group a perception which is usually a mere caricature in some ways it is better to be the hated than the inferior despite the fact he gets treated far worse hot blooded hatred can be far better for your self esteem than lukewarm apathy additionally the hated has a weird and twisted type of charisma to him because he is so polarizing he can stir strong emotions in people mostly negative but sometimes positive in many cases a hated can divide a social group in two those who side with the hated on whatever made up wrong he did and those who despise him in many cases although it is rare the hated can become high status by polarizing enough of the social group to his side and flipping or offering to flip the status hierarchy of the group this is rare and for every hated who succeeds in doing this there are who remained the hated or were driven out of the social hierarchy but it is something you must watch out for when bullying the hated amp x b techniques how to bully the two types of victims first i do not recommend physical violence it won t gain you much status if you re not in high school it won t gain you much status and plus today people are crazy they ll shoot you also there will always be men stronger than you so it s not good to rely on this no one really cares about the inferior so when you bully them you must be careful to not overdo it if you overtly insult or harangue them you risk looking like an asshole and becoming the hated yourself instead you subtly show everyone around you that you are more powerful than the inferior and you know it and he knows it you subtly put down the inferior not with your words but your actions people will notice this on a more subconscious level than consciously and they will do the same to the inferior while looking up to you i have seen people tiktoks of women saying shit like when he s the one in the friend group they all make fun of this is a natural instinct that most people do subconsciously when i list off example behaviors to put down the inferior you will immediately recognize someone your friend group does this to instinctively or worse yet you may see yourself in it i am teaching you how to take advantage of this behavior and use it consciously ways you can subtly put down the inferior are cutting him off when he speaks occasionally occasionally look at him with a face that looks annoyed disinterested or like you re not taking him seriously when he s talking do this at a time where he says something stupid is talking too much acting shy etc roll your eyes very slightly too much comes across as aggressive only pay half attention when he speaks when you re taking a group picture out with friends and he s along make him take the picture this is typically best done in company with women praise him like he s your little brother in front of strangers this is a good one jake finally got this promotion at work and i was so proud of him good job bro use terms like my buddy i was proud of him he finally did etc that subtly emasculate him if he mentions an accomplishment say something like really you tease him so much to the point where its excessive in front of the group but still a small enough amount that if he called you out on it you can be like yo i m just joking and he will look oversensitive if you re at a venue and they get up to use the bathroom or something take their seat talk to someone while sitting in it and take a while to get up when he comes back not making eye contact with him while he either waits to get his seat back or is forced to take another seat ask to borrow a small amount of money for him and never pay it back this one i m not as sure about cuz i ve never seen it in action myself but heard about it if there s an errand for a group hang out like picking up a alcohol for a kickback send him by himself to do it the most brutal example of this i can remember is me hanging out with a girl i was talking to her calling this fat dude classic inferior type over to her house while i was there making him bring us a pizza and kicking him out right after that s a pretty extreme example that you likely can t pull off as a man though bullying the inferior is a delicate balancing act if you overdo it you become the hated you want the inferior to feel like he s part of the social circle but have a sense that he s at the bottom of the hierarchy like a woman you can feed the inferior scraps occasionally where you re nicer to him so he feels like he s slowly ingratiating himself with the group this is best done when you re alone with him additionally temper you re bullying of the inferior to the group s treatment of him if other members of the group look uncomfortable or aren t joining in on your subtle bullying of the inferior after a bit then he s not socially inferior enough relative to you to pull it off stop your plans to bully the inferior because you can t pull it off amp x b bullying the hated is much easier people despise the hated and think he s a bad person so you can get away with much more you still can t overdo it and with every hated there is a small risk of turning the tide on them the older you are the less you can overtly insult someone even the hated and gain status from it but there are still subtle things you can do to the hated that you can t do to the inferior spread rumors you hear about the hated do everything you do to the inferior but more extreme exclude the hated from events occasionally you can call out the hated in a group when the hated does something of minor annoyance because he is so hated everyone will feel like he did something extremely annoying or even wrong most people in society are too polite to insult the hated to his face but you can take the pseudo moralistic stance of standing up to the hated when he does something like this and call him out on his bad behavior this will boost your status in the group as it seems like you re calling someone out who did something so terrible and no one wants to say it it can come across as very masculine in all reality you re just calling someone out for social status and harassing someone who probably doesn t deserve it a wide scale example of this is cancel culture act like you re attempting to undo whatever injustice the hated is perceived to have done in a social group it makes you look virtuous at their expense overtly insult the hated you must temper this to your age as a teenager you can mercilessly roast the shit out of someone and get praised for it the older you get you seem cruel for doing this as an adult an overt insult can be a witty joke at the hated s expense that goes too far the kind of joke that would garner the response omgggg stopppp it you re so baddddd teeeheeheee from a woman you can overdo bullying the hated too it s just harder but bullying the hated has the advantage of making you look virtuous climbing the social ladder dealing with medium and high status people the goal of this is to climb the social ladder in a group you re in or make sure you situate yourself well in a new group you re in but low and high status people in a social group tend to be the minority of people the vast majority of people are medium status these are the people you treat the best when you become high status medium status people will be like your followers so you praise them to their face and behind their back dale carnegie how to win friends and influence people style you act super interested in what they have to say you occasionally comment on how important their friendship is to you you invite them out introduce them to your friends you endear yourself to them medium status people are not like high status people so they re not used to this treatment therefore it is easy to get them to like you if you are not low status this will get them to talk about you positively which will boost your status in a group but beware never get caught talking negatively about anyone besides low status people it can and will backfire amp x b high status people are a bit harder to befriend while medium status people are excited to like anyone who likes them high status people are harder to engage with because they re used to that type of treatment to become high status in a group you must at least be medium status first if you are low status you can become medium status overtime if you are hated it s more than likely over you need to switch social groups if you are inferior by working on your inferiorities you can become medium status if you want to accelerate this you can bully a lower status person but regardless if you re low status i recommend just leaving the social group you re in because the low status label is hard to escape to befriend high status people you must appear to have some type of social value this varies from setting to setting but one thing that will always make you appear higher status wherever you go is being tall in shape good looking and charismatic you can control in a work setting being high status can be attained by being really good at your job being friends with everyone in the office in a school setting being known as a player being good at a sport and also having a lot of friends helps amp x b once you have shown sufficient value competence being friends with high status people will be easy as fuck being friends with the high status people in your social group will boost your own status a lot as high status people associate with other high status people as you can see an essential law of the universe is that the hungry don t get fed the more status you have the easier it is to get more whereas the reverse is sadly also true amp x b avoiding being a target i will mostly talk about avoiding being the inferior type of victim as a man every social interaction you engage in is a test of your competence and therefore status people act like it s women who shit test you but in reality other men shit test you as well and you probably deal with it more think of your social status as a sliding scale from like the monkeys described earlier when another man shit tests you if you pass your status scale goes up one and his goes down one one fuck up won t change how you re perceived but failing shit tests over and over will once your status scale drops below a certain number you become an inferior type bullying victim your innate status your first impression dictates where you start at i e are you tall or short or in shape fat skinny good looking average ugly charismatic boring for the older men do you have a good job do you make money do you know a lot of people in the social setting amp x b so what are male shit tests a man teases you a little too hard not normal friend teasing but in the way i described you would tease an inferior a male beats you in a competition a man disrespects you in some type of way how you respond to these will dictate how your status goes up and down overtime improve yourself to boost your status and avoid failing tests so as to not lower it and remember your default social status can vary from setting to setting if you re a minority for example where you live will have a significant impact on your smv at a harvard lab stephen hawking would be higher status than lebron james so don t be afraid to go to a setting that suits you best amp x b bullying women don t do this as a man you can t get away with this no matter what she does unless she is extremely hated you will look like an asshole even if she is the hated you have to be very careful let women bully other women women can effectively bully men and get away with it but the reverse is generally not true amp x b my results from taking the bullying pill over the past year this is all stuff i have known semi consciously since i was in middle school probably younger honestly in my brain this entire essay is an instinct at best a two second thought at worst but it s good to write it all down and sprinkle in my own life experience to round it out however i ve been really thinking about this consciously lately and intentionally did it the past year i also bullied more overtly than i personally recommend doing in this sub and i also used the technique on medium status people i described earlier to offset this as well benefits i ve seen people complimenting my charisma more people thinking i m funnier two separate instances of hookups resulting directly after a girl saw me bully another man compliments such as you re so bold i wish i had your confidence wider friend group being considered the main character of a group had a friend tell me you re like the main character of the group had someone outright tell me i love the way you occasionally antagonize people it s one of the funniest things being told the fact that you don t give a fuck is so attractive i love it so much by a large amount of women having people say about me i love how he calls people out on their bs he s not afraid to tell the truth the last one is especially funny to me i m not calling people out on any bs i m just harassing people who no one really cares about at best and is actively hated at worst and people are so cruel they love it cons i ve seen losing a bit of hope in humanity that the techniques i saw used on me for most of my childhood worked so well and it s actually fucked that we are so controlled by our reptilian instincts if try to you bully people and you don t pull it off well i e you stutter while insulting someone or you bully someone where there s not a huge enough status gap between you all it will make you look a bit pathetic this lowers your status and can make you into an inferior or hated if you do it too much amp x b conclusion many people will not like this post they will call it unethical or feminine even the second one is so retarded i won t even address it but as for ethics unfortunately the red pill is amoral spinning plates making a girl hamster dread game aren t exactly things society would consider nice either the difference with bullying is that it is an essential fact of life bullying is an instinct people will use to elevate their own status in relation to others and they don t even do it on purpose it s an instinct so regardless of who you are you will likely encounter bullying whether as a bystander victim or perpetrator now that you deeply understand the benefits of bullying you don t have to use this tool for bad maybe you can structure your behavior in a way where you curb your instincts to do it to others or don t reward people with status for bullying others or maybe you will just use this information to avoid being a victim yourself or maybe you will just bully people for status i don t really care either way use this information how you will amp x b one caveat though is that there are some relationships where none of this bs applies with your close friends and family you shouldn t be thinking about this stuff with them those should be relationships where you genuinely care about them most relationships in your life will be like this but if every single one is then you should reconsider who you call close
18577,over my many years on various forums and subs making friends etc i ve seen hundreds thousands of guys share their problems and questions about girls getting laid and self improvement when you ve been giving advice for a while a certain pattern starts to emerge a pattern in the questions and more importantly a pattern in the solutions often guys are looking for a silver bullet a pearl of wisdom that will magically click things into place for them and solve all their problems they re usually hoping more thinking or a change in mindset will help you sometimes that s true but of the time the answer to all of your problems is go hit on more girls yes doing the exact same thing you re already doing talking to girls amp trying to have sex with them usually fixes almost every issue you will ever have when it comes to dating sex relationships and keeping girls around talk to em on tinder hinge bumble etc talk to em in person out on the street talk to girls in bars doesn t matter where just hit on more girls you ll find the more girls you hit on the more you just dive right in and take action rather than sitting around overthinking everything the majority of your problems will magically take care of themselves taking action is pretty much always more impactful than sitting around trying to gain more knowledge or coming up with a perfect plan you d be better off going outside and saying hello to girls than reading anything on any site i got to where i am by taking action and doing things not sitting around reading self improvement articles you can read articles and posts at the end of each day after you ve taken at least one baby step to move yourself towards your goals amp x b i m way too outcome dependent being outcome dependent just means you care way too much about being rejected by girls to the point of beating yourself up every time a girl doesn t want to suck on your sausage and you know the only cure for caring too much about rejections getting rejected a shitload more until you slowly stop caring i ve lost count of the number of times a guy will come onto a forum write paragraphs about how angry he is at himself for caring too much about each rejection and asking us for a magic cure to fix his outcome dependency how can i make myself stop caring the answer is always the same there s no way to brainwash yourself into being outcome dependent literally the only way is to go out and hit on as many girls as humanly possible until you simply stop giving a shit which ones aren t into you and the more girls you hit on the more you ll start getting laid once you ve had a few successes you ll really stop caring about rejections because you ll be able to tell yourself well several other girls already liked me enough to sleep with me so it s cool if this girl isn t into me i ll go find someone who is awesome now you re even less outcome dependent you also need to remind yourself that this shit is entirely random getting laid is a number s game your only mission is to go hit on women then hit on more then more keep improving yourself looks style bodyfat muscle social life and keep hitting on girls that s all you have to do to get laid and become a better man to really drill it home here s the most recent reply i wrote to someone asking this exact question you become outcome independent by getting fucking laid not by trying to brainwash yourself stop posting go outside and talk to more girls dude you re probably due for a break from the forums you write too much go hit on girls i just got rejected go talk to more girls for every one girl who rejects you there ll be another girl who s super nice to you and makes you feel like a fucking boss for having the balls to hit on her don t dwell on the one who rejected you move on and find ones who like you i know rejection hurts nobody likes it even now after rejections it s probably more than that honestly i d still rather a girl say yes to me rather than no let yourself feel bad for a few minutes don t beat yourself up if rejection upsets you a bit and then go talk to more girls i promise it ll make you feel better i m anxiously waiting for this girl to reply two solutions to this one keep busy and distract yourself hobbies spend time with mates work on your self improvement throw yourself into your job whatever you have to do to stop obsessing about her replying to you hit on more girls everyone stresses about girls taking a while to reply to them when they re a newbie so don t beat yourself up over that talking to more girls fixes it immediately though it s really hard to give a crap about a girl taking ages to reply when you ve got other numbers in your phone is the loneliest number life is a lot easier when you have multiple girls you re talking to banging if you find yourself obsessively checking your phone for replies on tinder text use an app like stay focused to block tinder including notifications for a certain time of the day i have it set up so i can only access tinder from pm to midnight so the entire rest of the day i won t be bothered by notifications and won t be tempted to check if a girl has replied off the gridi s another great app it locks you out of your phone except for making phone calls for an amount of time you set example a guy was asking about a girl he was trying to organise a date with he was beating himself up for caring too much about whether or not she replied here s what i wrote you say i m not gonna invest in her too much you re already invested or you wouldn t have posted multiple times on here in just a few hours asking about the same girl cut yourself some slack you re a newbie to this so you re going to care a hell of a lot about each girl replying or not replying to your texts god knows i anxiously and neurotically checked my phone times an hour in the beginning praying a girl would reply to me getting angry when she didn t swearing i d never speak to her again then gushing like a little schoolgirl when she finally replied the one thing that makes it all better is going out and talking to more girls you ve gotta keep busy and distract yourself amp x b i fucked things up with this girl if there s one thing that s worse than rejection when you re a newbie it s the regret from pussying out nothing makes you feel worse than knowing you could have asked for her number or kissed her or fucked her but you didn t make a move there was nothing standing in your way except yourself i ve pussied out on tens of thousands of girls at this point no exaggeration i used to walk around my city pussying out on hundreds of girls for hours and hours and hours before finally working up the courage to just fucking talk to one and even when i went on dates i was far too nervous scared to hold their hand or kiss them or invite them back to my apartment i must have lost hundreds thousands of opportunities because of fear i also fucked things up with girls i was dating maybe i didn t text them too much or maybe i texted them too much maybe i got lazy and stopped improving myself and they got bored and left some girls i was way too cold to others i was too jealous and needy a lot of girls left me early on when i had no idea what i was doing and that s the point i had no idea what i was doing you need to cut yourself some slack if you don t have a lot of experience with women you re going to fuck things up some girls won t stick around no matter how much you want them to particularly if you don t have your shit together yet you can t beat yourself up over it your only job is to go out and hit on more girls get more experience keep improving yourself and you ll naturally get better with women over time i do get the regret though i get the overthinking it i get beating yourself up i get sitting around for hours ruminating on it trying to come up with a way to fix it if only i had a fucking time machine i could go back and do it all over again properly well son you have a time machine sort of it s called going out and hitting on more girls you can t have a do over with the girl you chickened out on but the good news is you have unlimited tries no matter how many girls you fuck things up with you can always go talk to a new girl you can t wallow in the past when the present is right here the present won t wait for you example a guy asked me for some advice about a girl he met in public talked to for a bit but was too scared to ask for her number he was coming up with all these plans to have an excuse to go back to where he met her and then ask for her number he was getting himself all worked up really stressing and beating himself up over the fact he chickened out my reply i dont even have to read this big wall of text you just wrote to know the answer to your question will be go talk to more girls yep having now read everything you just wrote the answer is still you guessed it go talk to more girls go back and ask for this girl s number sure but you wouldn t even be asking this question if you were hitting on more girls you d just tell yourself oh well i chickened out on her i m a little pussy doesn t matter i ll go talk to other girls today amp x b this girl stopped responding ghosted me if a girl stops responding to your texts a girl you haven t met up with yet just delete her number and go talk to more girls i know it can be frustrating if you ve put in quite a bit of time talking to her and started getting excited to meet her that s exactly why i say not to waste time having long conversations but if she s no longer responding the writing is on the wall she s not interested forget her and go talk to more girls and for god s sake don t worry about what you might have said wrong to this particular girl don t worry about how to get her to keep talking to you talking to a girl for ages doesn t mean you re making progress just let her go like a leaf on the wind go out and find the next girl to talk to in the case of ghosting a girl you ve already banged just stops replying to your messages all of a sudden without telling you why that s shitty of her and it sucks it s happened to you and then go hit on more girls amp x b i feel needy clingy with this girl i m banging neediness and being too over invested in a girl is a horrible feeling i m speaking from experience when you re needy clingy you get into this horrible situation where you feel like you need her more than she needs you that can quickly turn into worries of what if i never get my needs met what if i m dissatisfied and unhappy forever you start overthinking everything and worrying too much about it all it feels awful you feel like you care about and she doesn t care about you even if she does you get clingy and attached ruining the relationship because you can never actually relax and just be in the moment with her you re always analysing your every move thinking is this too clingy can she tell how needy i am does she secretly hate me sometimes the pressure gets too much and you self sabotage maybe having a big fight you don t care about me or maybe you do what i ve done in the past break up with girls and then be left with no girls to fuck just to run away from my own clinginess the answer is to go talk to more girls and build up some options you need to show yourself there s other girls in the world who ll like you so you re not so afraid of any one girl leaving you over time your neediness will fade away as you relax knowing you have some options out there if you re in a monogamous relationship and talking to other girls is off the table then build yourself a social life so you re not relying on your girl for all your social emotional needs make friends try new hobbies you need to build up at least a couple of people you can rely on to talk things through to socialise with and to handle your emotional needs amp x b my serious relationship just ended if you ve been with a girl for a while months even if you guys were only casual it s going to suck when things end being sad over a breakup and missing an ex is a completely normal and healthy reaction the only thing that makes that better is distracting yourself focusing on your hobbies friends etc and the best distraction of all as well as the best closure is forcing yourself to talk to more girls yes you may need to grieve for a few days a couple of weeks be kind to yourself and keep as busy as you possibly can so the time passes quicker time heals all wounds then push yourself to go talk to more girls it ll be hard as first but you can do it thousands of men have moved on before you and you will too as soon as you show yourself there s other options out there you ll start to feel a little better you ll feel like ok i still miss my ex but at least my life is starting to continue forward and when you do meet the next girl and have sex with her you will have an epiphany holy shit i don t have to be stuck on my ex forever there are other women in the world i can spend my time with yes you ll probably still miss your ex a bit yes you ll probably still miss her but you ll be starting to heal by moving on you need to just trust me on this one talking to other girls will make you feel better not immediately it takes a little time to move on but each new girl you talk to will make you feel better and if you think but my ex was the one i ll never find another girl like her there is no the one there s lots of ones lots of girls who ll be an amazing match for you and who ll rock your fucking world hitting on and meeting more girls will show you that not to mention talking to other girls is making progress instead of sitting around focusing on the past that doesn t mean you forget about your ex or never think about her again you ll always have the happy memories you two shared together but for right now when you re sad and miserable and feeling shitty you need to force yourself to go out and hit on more girls even if it s hard at first it ll get easier for each new girl you hit on amp x b amp x b my fuckbuddy is busy can t see me this week ask yourself this if i had a second girl i was banging would i care that this girl is busy probably not so go talk to more girls i know it s frustrating when your fuckbuddy friends with benefits has plans is on her period you can always have anal sex instead etc and doesn t want to meet you early on when i was just starting to get laid a few times i was in a position where i only had fuckbuddy and she was busy it frustrated the hell out of me i was horny really wanting to get laid and my only option wasn t available right now know what fixed it going out and talking to more girls not only did that instantly make me feel better because i was interacting with new girls even just talkingto girls makes you feel pretty good it s rewarding in itself when you re newbie but some of those girls wanted to go on a date with me and some of them wanted to have sex with me which fixed my i have no options problem the worst feeling for a guy who s working on getting laid is lack of options go out and talk to a tonne of girls or message a bunch on tinder and proveto yourself you have options there s billion girls on the planet you have options it s up to you to go say hi to them you ll sometimes find if your fuckbuddy is busy for a week you ll go talk to a tonne of girls and that ll pass the time in itself while also being a productive use of your time a week will pass your fuckbuddy will hit you up to meet and you ll go oh wow it s already been a week hell yeah let s meet amp x b i have a theory about something often guys will tell me they have a theory about something to do with getting laid sometimes it s i have a theory that wearing black clothes makes girls more likely to give you their number because black is a badboy colour i have a theory that me carrying my big camera around will make girls think i m more interesting and therefore i ll get laid more i have a theory that telling girls i m only here for a few weeks will make them less likely to sleep with me because they ll know there s a time limit to things the problem with all these theories is they re just that theories you already know my thoughts on unfounded theories what you re supposed to do is go outside and actually experiment with your theory put it to the test debating weird theories you invented gets you no closer to getting laid than sitting at home staring at a wall example a guy wrote paragraphs about his theory question can being a photographer help you get laid he went on and on and on about it we re against theory posts here dude go out and take action in the time you wrote all this you could have gone outside and asked girls if you can take their photo then said actually you re really cute wanna grab a drink with me sometime what s your number now stop posting and go outside and talk to girls the problem is guys think they re being productive when they write these theory threads you think i m figuring stuff out i m gaining more knowledge this is helping me get laid nah it s doing jack shit to get you laid you re just sitting around mental masturbating the time you waste coming up with your theory posting it and then debating the topic with other people is time you could have spent hitting on women one of whom would have slept with you amp x b i have approach anxiety when you have approach anxiety being nervous about hitting on girls the only solution is to force yourself to hit on more girls yes it s fucking terrifying beating my approach anxiety was the hardest thing i ever did and the most terrifying i had several breakdowns it was absolutely worth it forcing yourself to talk to girls is exposure therapy the only way to make anxiety fear nerves go away you can t brainwash yourself into just not feeling anxiety the only way to get comfortable hitting on girls is to actually hit on girls being full of fear is totally ok it s normal a man isn t courageous because he acts without fear a man is courageous because he acts in spite of the fear she said i have a boyfriend i m married i know this is a radical notion for a lot of pickup artists but when a girl tells you she has a boyfriend or is married she s politely rejecting you i have a boyfriend is often something girls say when they re trying to reject you as nicely as possible maybe she s not into you or she s not in a good mood or she doesn t like giving her number out to someone she just met etc in those cases girls will give an automatic sorry i have a boyfriend as a polite catch all when they don t want to go any further respect what she s saying to you instead of thinking you can manipulate get around what she s just said move on and go hit on more girls i know a lot of pickup artists talk about winning a girl over even if she has a boyfriend is that really worth it to you first of all she s just turned you down don t you want to hold your head up high have some pride in yourself and get laid with girls who don t make it a fucking battle to have sex with them and in the case where she actually does have a boyfriend do you really want to deal with that girls with boyfriends can often bring more drama and are way more hassle you basically have to fight her every step of the way trying desperately to convince her to cheat on her boyfriend husband for you not to mention he may find out and start throwing drama at you as well are you so desperate and attached to this one girl you can t go find another one don t you have other options of course you do even if you think you don t right now there are billion other girls on the planet a tonne of them will be single go hit on those ones instead and leave the attached girls to their boyfriends husbands whether made up or real amp x b this girl i m dating has dealbreakers go talk to more girls in a lot of cases if there s no chance of compromise and the girl you re seeing has dealbreakers huge red flags it s better to go find a new girl who ll match up with you better trust me speaking from experience it is damn hard to change someone it s usually a fool s errand not to mention trying to force a girl to be something someone she really doesn t want to or can t be leads to certain drama and a tonne of anxiety on your part as you stress yourself trying to change her you re better off finding a girl who ticks more of your boxes a girl you don t have to spend so much effort trying to change one you can build something awesome with right from the start don t try and squash a square peg in a round hole go hit on more girls and find one who s more suited to you and what you re looking for amp x b i want to bang hotter girls another easy one go hit on more girls a lot of guys overcomplicate this saying but i don t want to lower my standards if you re inexperienced you don t have a choice lower your standards you can t expect to bang hot girls if you don t have much experience or practice getting laid with average or cute girls you certainly don t bang hot girls by having less sex and being more fussy i want to bang hot girls therefore i won t even talk to any girl below an that s a surefire way to end up lonely as hell and make yourself needy after all if you aren t banging any girls right now do you think you ll do better with the hot girls or do you think you ll be outcome dependent as we talked about above think of cute girls as training in order to be able to bang the hottest girls they ll make you more confident you ll get some practice sticking to a gameplan and knowing how to get laid and some of them will be absolute sweethearts to you and will make great fuckbuddies getting laid makes you a better man which helps you pull the hotter girls you really want who knows by not being so fussy you might even meet some girls you really really like amp want to keep around i have a lot of experience with this i started out really nervous around hot girls and i couldn t even talk to them let alone hit on them and try to bang them even if i somehow accidentally got them into the bedroom i would have been too nervous to even get it up how d i deal with my weirdness around hot girls i focused on the average and cute girls instead the girls i was semi comfortable hitting on i gained a lot of experienced had a lot of lays and made a lot of awesome memories and guess what i became more confident then i was able to start hitting on the hot girls and even though i was still pretty nervous i was no longer terrified of them i banged a couple using the experienced i gained from all the previous girls and got myself to a point where i now only bang girls i m really attracted to if you want hot girls go hit on a lot of girls amp x b i want to have a some having a some isn t that hard just hit on a bunch of girls until you find who are up for a some here s some basics ask each one ever fooled around with another girl or thought about it keep hitting on more girls and asking each new fuckbuddy this question when you have girls who are both up for fooling around together show them each other s pics if they like each other invite them both around one night have some wine and go for it if you re nervous to start just have a glass of wine each and then just kiss one of them the rest will naturally follow i promise or you can say you two should kiss and they will then the rest will follow your first some won t be smooth it ll be a learning experience that s cool have fun with it nobody expects you to be a sex god the first time so once again the solution is go hit on more girls amp x b this girl just told me let s just be friends sucks but move on and talk to more girls your only power is the ability to do your own thing you can t make a girl want to fuck you if she s said explicitly she wants to be friends if i had another girl i was banging would i care that this girl only wants to be friends what if i had girls i was banging course not you d already be getting sex especially if you had at least two fuckbuddies the friendzone thing would barely even register amp x b this girl i was talking to seemed totally dtf then changed her mind last minute i know it s frustrating as hell especially when you were so close do what i said above unmatch block her then move on and talk to more girls use the frustration of her not banging you as motivation to go talk to more girls go nuts example a guy was stressing about a girl he was flirting with and got a number off they were hitting it off she seemed very keen to meet him and then she just decided she didn t want to meet him he was asking what things he could do or say to get her to change her mind even though she d made it very clear she didn t want to meet any more i wrote don t stress too much about this you did everything about as well as you could have done some girls aren t going to fuck you no matter how perfect things seem no matter how much they seem into you girls are like a leaf on the wind they often change direction from moment to moment don t write anything back to her she said i cannot speak to you any more respect that and move on go talk to more girls there s billion other girls on the planet for you to talk to again you did everything right here forget her and go hit on the next one amp x b i hate women i know this isn t what you ll want to hear if you hate women but the only way to hate them less is to spend more time with them you ll eventually come to see women are just like men there are some bad ones some average ones and some truly amazing ones you need to give yourself the chance to meet the amazing ones and the only way to do that is to you guessed it hit on more women over time you ll naturally hate women less and less and will eventually start to like them i absolutely detested women and female nature at the start that changed slowly as i got to know a few really sweet girls do your best to look for the good in women try your hardest to find examples of kindness loyalty and sweetness there s plenty of it out there if you try to find it go hit on more girls it s ok if you are bitter at the start that ll change over time try to keep an open mind and just trust what i m telling you spending time with lots of women will eventually solve your women hating issues you ll find some women are absolute sweethearts you just have to find them for the longest time i really hated women i ve talked about it on this sub i hated everything about them i totally detested them i wanted to hate them but over time i met too many really lovely girls who softened my heart and wore down my resolve to hate them really genuinely good kind people who wanted the best for me and added a lot to my life no matter how hard i tried and i really did try i couldn t hate them they were just too kind eventually i realised if these girls are genuinely good people maybe there s other girls who are good people i kept talking to more girls started actively trying to find the good ones and started running away from the bad ones these days my life is full of only good women i don t let myself dislike any women if i feel myself starting to dislike a girl when i m talking to her on tinder via text i immediately unmatch her and talk to a girl who makes me like her if you hate women your path to hating them less is the same as mine go hit on more girls amp x b i m bad at sex easy one if you have a girlfriend fuckbuddy right now have a lot of sex with her and practice but if you don t have a girl you re seeing go talk to more girls the more girls you date bang the more you ll be able to practice foreplay sex making girls orgasm etc being good at sex just takes practice like everything else amp x b you re seeing a pattern yep just about every problem you throw at me can be solved with go talk to more girls i could come up with more examples of times where your problem seems unique and different to the examples above and you re convinced it must have a unique answer but the answer still ends up being go talk to more fucking girls don t be a pussy get off this sub and talk to more girls right now
18641,field report cross posted text i m feel very betrayed by my g f f from the way we entered into our relationship and i feel deceived about how she has portrayed herself i m not the op amp x b we met years ago at a party of a mutual friend once we were introduced we ended up spending the entire rest of the party just sitting and talking to one another it really felt like we were the only two people there and as the night ended she told me that she really enjoyed talking to me and asked me for my number which was a first for me amp x b i awoke the next morning to a text from her telling me how much she enjoyed talking with me and wanted to know if i would be interested in getting together to talk some more i agreed and that next weekend we met at a local book store coffee house where we proceeded to spend hours talking until the shop kicked us out because they were closing not once in either of the conversations did we talk about anything romantic or love or anything like that it was everything from philosophy to economics to religion and everything in between once again she tells me she has had a great time and asks if we can do this again we set a time for the next weekend and same exact thing happens again this goes on for more times and i am very confused as to what this is are we just friends getting together to talk is this going anywhere else i had no idea amp x b she sends me a text that week prior to meeting telling me that i am the easiest person she has ever talked to and that she feels totally comfortable and safe being with me amp x b so finally at the end of the next day when she says she wants to do this again i just said that i was curious as to what she considered these times together as i asked if we are just friends or was there a possibility of being more amp x b she said that she really enjoyed our time together and would like to see where it goes next time we are together as we are talking i kind of reached out and took her hand and we held hands for the first time for several minutes amp x b i tell her at the end of this night that next time i would like to do something different with her and took her to the movies things went well and during the movie i put my arm around her and she laid her head on my shoulder as we parted that night i gathered up my courage and leaned in to give her a kiss goodnight her response was not what i expected she actually withdrew from my attempt and i immediately apologized to her and felt like a total heel she said that i didn t need to apologize but she was just a little shocked as she wasn t expecting it i quickly apologized again and withdrew for the night embarrassed beyond belief amp x b she texted me the very next day saying she was sorry about the night before she really liked me and wants to move that direction in our relationship but she wanted to take things slow i replied saying that i was willing to go at whatever speed she wanted and again apologized because i felt really bad amp x b now mind you while i said i was willing to go at her speed and i was but i was really confused by what taking it slow meant we had been seeing each other once a week for hours at a time for over months but being very inexperienced in the relationship game only had a g f in high school and went out on dates in college but mostly as friends and nothing ever lasted i just thought i would let her take the lead amp x b we went out more times and then at the beginning of our next date she actually greeted me with kiss from there our relationship advanced at what i consider a normal pace a year and a half later we were living together and imo everything was going great that is until two weeks ago she had to pick me up at my work because my car was in the shop she pulled up and was sitting in the car and one of my co workers who i m friendly with came out with me as he was leaving at the same time i introduced them from a distance but clearly within view of each other they wave hello and we left amp x b the next day i came back and he said he wanted to make sure there wasn t going to be a problem between the two of us i asked him why would there be and he said she didn t say anything to you i said she did not and he said well it was a couple of years ago so she may not even remember him and then he proceeds to tell me that they matched up on tinder and would hook up with each other and it went on for a few months before be started dating his current girl friend i told him that it might have been a different person and he then proceeds to show me her tinder profile i ve never used the site before so i wasn t sure how to look at anything but he said it does not look like she is active on there now and hasn t been for awhile but the fact of the matter was that for sure it was her and to make matters worse i didn t tell him this but the time frame that he was saying was also some of the same time we were together in the beginning the times i was rebuked for leaning in for a kiss and quit possibly even after this amp x b he could tell this was bothering me and he apologized but said that i needed to know that they were never dating or anything it was just getting together to have sex as though i was supposed to be okay with that he didn t want to say much else but he said that i should know that he knows for a fact that he wasn t the only one amp x b needless to say this all upset me greatly but i didn t know what to do or how to handle this it was eating away at me and i did something i probably shouldn t have done but we share an outlook calendar and have for over a year so that we can plan our events while she was gone i looked at her laptop and found her outlook which was nothing more than what we shared however i noticed she had a separate calendar and it was not password protected i went back on her calendar even though i knew it was wrong and sure as shit there was his first name and yes for fact some of those dates were after we were already past the getting to know you stage but wait there s more amp x b not only was his name there but there were several other guys names there were weeks where she had a different name on every day of the week and twice had two names on weekend days amp x b what made me the sickest of all though was looking at the weeks where we were early on in our relationship when i had to basically be afraid to hold her hand that she was meeting with other guys that week and even one time earlier in the day when we met how do i know this you might ask my name was on there as well amp x b now it does appear that about months after we started dating the names mostly stopped and by a year in there were no more names amp x b but what really sucks is that one guy s name is on there more than others and this is a guy who she has brought to our house on more than one occasion and introduced us she has never once told me that they were ever sexual partners in fact that is what kind of pisses me off about all of this frankly if i didn t know any of this i would tell you she was a prude sex is very vanilla and i always have to initiate it amp x b however she just told me not more than a month ago that she feels like i am her soulmate and she loves me with all of her heart amp x b this is causing me a lot of pain to be honest i don t think i can live with this the fact that i had to wait for months to even kiss and hold hands while all along she was getting sex from a variety of people makes me feel like absolute shit the fact that i honestly was beating myself up after trying for a kiss really pisses me off then there is a part of me that says i m not good enough sure she may enjoy my personality or whatever but obviously i am not attractive enough for her to want to be with me early on really bothers me amp x b i mean it would be one thing if she did all of this before we met but there are names marked clearly after we were involved just before we moved in together including the guy i work with amp x b i have yet to confront her i don t know what i m going to do or say there is a very large part of me that just wants out of this i feel like she is not the person she portrayed herself to be oh believe me she is a very judgmental person and has tons of opinions and comes across as holier than thou even though she is not religious per se amp x b has anyone else ever had to deal with this amp x b tl dr g f made me jump through hoops at the beginning of our relationship telling me we had to take it slow all the while having tinder dates with multiple guys that lasted nearly a year into our relationship and even to this day is not really sexual with me i found all of this out from a co worker who told me they hooked up well into out relationship although he didn t know i existed and he had proof after thinking about this a lot i decided that if everything was true i didn t believe i could live with it from my point of view not only did it change the entire basically first year of our relationship it fundamentally changed who i thought she was i mean we can all have different ways we react around people but there are some things you can t just be one way one day and one way another day amp x b but after reading some of the replies to my first post i agreed with a couple of things just because the names were there it doesn t necessarily mean she was sleeping with or even dating those guys as was said my name was in there and we sure as hell weren t having sex during a lot of these times leaving without at least giving her a chance to explain things seemed wrong as well amp x b which led to the dilemma i faced how do i tell her i know about all of these names as a reminder i snooped i certainly could just tell her about my co worker but how would i know about all of the other names amp x b so i just basically decided to tell her about the co worker and see what happened from there amp x b this was the most unpleasant conversation i ve ever had because on top of everything the g f i ve had has been great we ve never fought or had even a hint of disagreement or betrayal i love who i thought she was so i couldn t just bail without at least talking about it amp x b she acted like she didn t know my co worker she acted like she was shocked he would say this and said honestly she didn t remember him at first i was buying everything she was selling because i wanted to and also because she was very convincing however i showed her the tinder profile and she started to get a little defensive she said yes she had tinder at one time but hasn t been on it for years which according to my co worker was true amp x b so i was going to drop it and just go on but at the last minute i said to her he told me the dates you went out and how it crossed times with when you and i were together to which she said he was lying because it ended well before we became a couple amp x b that s when i knew she was lying she had told me that she didn t recognize him but when confronted with timeline she now claimed to know him and said timeline was wrong amp x b when i pointed out her logical flaw to her she became frustrated and started crying my initial response was to comfort her but midway through doing that i decided that she might very well be doing this to manipulate me and said that while i was there for her i wanted to know the truth and this is where i sort of lied to her i told her he provided me with in depth timeline and showed me dates on his calendar she said she honestly did not know when but she thought it was over before we became a couple amp x b this is when i made my mistake of asking when did she consider us a couple amp x b she said she considered us a couple when we moved in together let me remind everyone we were seeing each other for almost two years before we moved in together so i asked her during that time frame if she had dated anyone else she was emphatic that she didn t date anyone at all so i know it was crude but i just came out and said ok maybe not date anyone but did you have sex with anyone she didn t answer me and i knew my answer amp x b by this time she is crying uncontrollably telling me how much she loved me how everything was way in the past etc etc amp x b i decided to give her a break before i confronted her because she legitimately was hyperventilating amp x b once she calmed down i just said i knew about the guy who she brought to our house as well this one was obviously a subject she was dreading because she went from crying hysterically to pale as a ghost amp x b at this point she starts trying to apologize and say s that none of the other guys have ever meant anything to her and that i am the love of her life amp x b i told her that the only way i would even consider working through this would be for her to come clean right there and then and i kind of let her know that i already know other things and would tell how i know if i have to amp x b this was the one thing i now regret because she just flat out told me everything things i never in a million years wanted to know including confirming that yes she met with tinder dates twice on days we met later in the evening she said she did not consider us official and we hadn t even really said what we were doing was dating with those two times date wise she is correct from the standpoint that this was before we kissed amp x b anyway i told her i needed time to think about it and told her i was going to stay with a friend she begged me not to go she very legitimately was upset and said none of this was meant to hurt me she didn t understand why i was so upset about the stuff from before we met but said she see s why i would be upset about things that happened after we met i left to stay with a friend but i agreed to keep the line of communications open amp x b she sent me a very long emotional text the next morning explaining how as a teenager she never respected herself and used sex to validate herself and that she had never understood what a real relationship was or what love was until she met me it was very long and detailed but that was the gist of it amp x b i responded that i thanked her for her honesty but i laid out how her making me wait and more to the point making me feel like a creep for just trying to reach out and kiss her while she was getting screwed by any number of guys was very hurtful to me and frankly had made me doubt myself as a man and absolutely destroyed any romantic notions i had of our relationship amp x b she did not respond to my text so i could not decide if she was upset or mad at me but a half hour later my friend tells me she is at the door and she is very emotional did i want him to let her see me i went to the door and she immediately begins crying harder than i ve ever seen anyone cry she couldn t even talk she kept trying but it made no sense i got her to sit down and she threw herself at me trying to hug me after she calmed down a little she finally got out that she was so sorry she never meant to hurt me eventually after quite some time she calmed down enough to talk and she let it be known that what i wrote to her was heartbreaking she never even considered it that way she tried to explain that she was so in love with me that she didn t want to mess it up with sex and wanted us to be what she thought we had become i let her go on but eventually explained to her that while that may be her point of view it certainly was not mine i just went ahead and explained that it made me feel unattractive and less desirable that guys who supposedly meant nothing to her amp x b well i went on for awhile myself but i ll spare you the details amp x b i just told her that there was no way for me to go back to what we had because i do not view her as the same person anymore that knowing that she willingly had sex with other people after she had sex with me was just a deal breaker she jumped in and said that it never happened after we slept together she said she would freely admit to sleeping with other guys up until we kissed but after that night she new she loved me and cut everything else out amp x b i have no way of knowing obviously of course i have no faith in what she said however i do have her calendar and it pretty much does show a rapid slow down right around that time amp x b i told her i still need time and again she texted that night with a very emotional letter saying acknowledging my feelings over this and told me that the fact she hurt me makes her feel worse than anything that she would do anything to make this work swore that she has never and will never cheat on me since she fell in love with me amp x b so i m still here at my friends house i still don t know for sure what i m going to do i do love her and i can tell she is not faking this at all she is an emotional wreck i ve called her family to have them go check on her just told them we were having a rough time and would prefer to not answer anything else at the time amp x b i again want to stress this because i don t think it came across in my first post her personality does not show any of this at all in fact she is quit judgmental about people who do what she did she never said she was a virgin btw so let s not go that far but she absolutely led me to believe she only believed in sex in the confines of a relationship that is now a confirmed lie amp x b i m supposed to meet her friday i m not sure if i will or won t amp x b sorry it s not a finalized update but i ve gotten quit a few request asking what s going on i m sorry for making another post i was going to tack this on my last one but for some reason my post keep getting locked and i haven t even been able to respond to people on the second one i have been getting buried in chat request and private messages asking me for an update so instead of answer each one i am just going to post this here and hope it doesn t get deleted amp x b thursday later afternoon i met with a friend who knew of her but had never met her i wanted someone with a complete fresh perspective and outside voice in other words someone who didn t know her or had formed an opinion of her amp x b i explained everything that i wrote in the first two posts and just asked his opinion he said that he wasn t going to give an opinion because he and i were not alike but what he would do is ask me to consider some questions amp x b would i have pursued her if i knew she was actively having sex with multiple partners amp x b would i have willingly continued the relationship early on if i knew that she was coming on obvious dates with me but having sex with multiple partners amp x b knowing now what i didn t know then do i see her as the same person who i dated fell in love with and moved in together amp x b did i see a future with her where i would have an unconditional trusting loving relationship with her amp x b he had other questions as well but none were more or as important as these amp x b i don t know why but these questions made it crystal clear what my thoughts were and what i had to do it doesn t mean it was easy nor did i like it amp x b on friday i took the day off of work and two of my friends came with me and while she was at work i packed up everything that was mine from our apartment and moved it to storage fortunately i don t own that much and decided that anything we bought together i would leave at the apartment with her fortunately we are already out of our lease and were just renting month to month so there is no long term financial issue for me but i did not want to be unfair so i went to my savings and drew out months of what would have been my part of the rent amp x b she got home from work at around and when she came in she immediately saw my stuff was gone and she dropped her bag on the floor and sat on the couch and started crying amp x b this was the hardest thing i ve ever done in my life and i ended up crying almost as much as she did i just explained to her that she did not deserve to be with someone who had any doubts about her or had anything but a total positive image of who she is amp x b i told her that i had to work on myself because in talking with my friend and reading on here i found out that a lot of my ideas around sex and relationships are not in line with today s thinking and i know i have to somehow get past that amp x b i am certain she will be far better off without me because at the end of the day i just can t be who she needs me to be wish i could wish i could just view it as no big deal but i do amp x b anyway i stayed as long as it made sense to try and comfort her but at the end of the day i was not doing it so i left her curled up on the couch in tears amp x b this certainly did not end how i thought or hoped it would but at the end of the day we both are very young and life is to short she will easily find a new guy and i am going to work on myself and see if i can t grow from this amp x b also before i go i do want to respond to what several people had said about my co worker who is the one who started all of this obviously i will never know his true motivation he could just be a trouble maker as some have stated and i ll never know however my belief is that he was afraid she said something and did not want there to be an issue between us at work by both of their accounts he is the one who cut it off with her to date the girl he is with now so while it could be jealousy or whatever i kind of doubt it if he wanted to be with her i think he probably still could have been because he ended whatever their relationship was amp x b tl dr friend asked me series of questions that clarified my entire thought process towards this ended things on friday both of us are miserable but ultimately this will be better for her in the long run conclusion despite op s inexperience his process of working through his circumstances especially his emotions really stands out he didn t attack his partner he was critical of his own reactions then proactively sought out help special mention to op s friend those are the piercing questions every man should be asking casually not so much but especially vetting for ltr s it s always good to remind yourself not just that it s her turn but to remain critical of it godspeed and good luck
18748,today is stalin s birthday and we have decided to make a mater post about him his accomplishments and debunking some of the lies about him this post was created by the central committee of r europeansocialists in particular u bolshevikshqiptar u soviet odarin u jmlsky u user name ofcl this master post is divided into parts the rise of stalin debunking trotsky the holodomor gulags the constitution and the elections the great purge ww lies and propaganda the accomplishments of the ussr under him the legacy of stalin the rise of stalin debunking trotsky many are the slanders against stalin and even more are the myths surrounding him and the ussr epsecially during his tenure as the general secretary of the cpsu many lies also surround his rise to power and his faction s conflict with trotskye s even today many leftists still believe that stalin was somehow an ussurper and that trotsky was the rightfull whatever that means successor of lenin i stalin during the civil war and the first years of the soviet government it is many times painted that stalin played a minimal role in the civil war and in the first years of the soviet union or even a negative role leave aside that he was one of the first bolsheviks contrary to trotsky who only entered the bolsheviks in stalin was a close ally of lenin since writing the book marxism and the national question and also doing real revolutionary work by attacking banks for the sake of the revolution if stalin was not so famous during the revolution in the masses was because he was in the gulag for about a decade right before he was freed in a little before the revolution but let s examine the facts it is impossible that stalin did not enjoyed support from the party since the very beginning he was one of the ministers since the first days of the october revolution he was the editor of pravda before the revolution even occurred therefore it is illogical to even claim that stalin was mediocre as trotsky wrote during the first days after the revolution even bourgeoisie historians such as montefiore describe that lenin stalin sverdlov and trotsky were the four most powerful bolsheviks how could stalin be relatively irrelevant while he was a high member of the bolsheviks and this means he enjoyed support since the very beginnings after the revolution during the civil war stalin was sent to many important posts where he unmasked many traitors who were working for the white army some of them were also on good terms with trotsky bourgeoisie historian robert h mcneal wrote stalin had emerged as a political military chief whose contribution to the red victory was second only to trotsky s stalin had played a smaller role than his rival in the overall organizationof the red army but he had been more important in providing direction on crucial fronts if his reputation as a hero was far below trotsky s this had less to do with objective merit than with stalin s lack of flair for self advertisement during the preparations for the polish soviet war stalin argued against the war as unrealistic after the defeat of the soviets in the war to which stalin was a general in the front most bolsheviks agreed with stalin that indeed the war was a mistake unfortunately it was too late due to his actions during the war plus his previous involvement before the revolution stalin had achieved high prestige he held two commissariats one of the nationalities and one of the workers and peasants inspections when another high bolshevik yevgeni preobrazhensky who was later a trotskyist and a member left opposition complained against stalin holding these positions lenin himself replied what can we do to preserve the present situation in the people s commissariat of nationalities to handle all the turkestan caucasian and other questions these are all political questions they have to be settled these are questions that have engaged the attention of european states for hundreds of years and only an infinitesimal number of them have been settled in democratic republics we are settling them and we need a man to whom the representatives of any of these nations can go and discuss their difficulties in all detail where can we find such a man i don t think comrade preobrazhensky could suggest any better candidate than comrade stalin the same thing applies to the workers and peasants inspection this is a vast business but to be able to handle investigations we must have at the head of it a man who enjoys high prestige otherwise we shall become submerged in and overwhelmed by petty intrigue all this implies that even lenin considered stalin obviously a first rate bolshevik if trotskyists or any other person wants to present stalin as a mediocre and a second rate bolshevik then it can be said that lenin himself was also a mediocrity and a second rate bolshevik for having such a good opinion of stalin and entrusting him with such crucial tasks ii lenin s testament lenin indeed wrote a letter but it was not a will and it could not be because the party was not lenin s plaything nor lenin was the king of it so this exposes the mentality and the very un marxist thinking of the people who tried to refute stalin on the grounds of this testament before anything it must be asserted that stalin was the second more powerful if not the most at around now the question around on the word power power comes from somewhere in this case stalin was chosen to by these people he was appointed who vested this power in his shoulders to represent them in he was the only person who as a member of both the politburo the orgburo the central committee and the secretariat he was also the man responsible for lenin s relations with the doctors the doctors had ordered that lenin must not be bothered by political matters as this would make him lose the peace needed to recover stalin sough to obey this order for lenin s sake but lenin s wife passed information to lenin bypassing the orders of the doctors stalin angry at this verbally attacked lenin s wife on the phone when lenin heard this he became very angry at stalin therefore the contents of the letter need to take in light this personal anger of lenin at the time when the writings became famous to the west and many anti communists attacked stalin in and that the bolsheviks were hiding this will trotsky responded at the time eastman asserts in several places that the central committee has concealed from the party a large number of documents of extraordinary importance written by lenin during the last period of his life the documents in question are letters on the national question the famous testament etc this is pure slander against the central committee of our party eastman s words convey the impression that lenin wrote these letters which are of an advisory character and deal with the inner party organization with the intention of having them published this is not at all in accordance with the facts if all of these letters have not been published it is because their author did not intend them to be published comrade lenin has not left any testament the character of his relations to the party and the character of the party itself preclude the possibility of such a testament the bourgeois and menshevik press generally understand under the designation of testament one of comrade lenin s letters which is so much altered as to be almost unrecognizable in which he gives the party some organizational advice the thirteenth party congress devoted the greatest attention to this and to the other letters and drew the appropriate conclusions all talk with regard to a concealed or mutilated testament is nothing but a despicable lie directed against the real will of comrade lenin and against the interests of the party created by him eastman s assertions that the central committee confiscated my pamphlets and articles in or or at any other time or by any other means has prevented their publication are untrue and are based on fantastic rumors eastman is again wrong in asserting that comrade lenin offered me the post of chairman of the council of people s commissars and of the council of labor and defense i hear of this for the first time from eastman s book the funny part is that this is true lenin was neither a despot nor the party his personal guard to follow wills now if trotsky and his supporters ignore this in favor of an explanation such as trotsky was forced to write this by stalin and if we take that what trotsky wrote is not true and that trotsky wrote it under pressure then this gives us a very strong info about these people they thought lenin as a king the party as his plaything whoever agrees with the narrative pushed about the will he is fundamentally against the principles lenin himself supported which is democractic centralism therefore if someone is trying to paint what trotsky himself wrote he attacks both lenin the viability of democratic centralism and the historical facts of stalin growing to become the leader of the party little by little by his own contribution as a bolshevik as a pupil of lenin and this was manifested to the appointments of him by the whole party in positions of power now one needs to consider what the contexts around the letter is the context is lenin as a sick paralyzed man who was angry at stalin for speaking badly against his wife on the phone and who lenin himself never spoke on the letter about any successor he pointed that stalin was a perfect general secretary and he would be replaced by someone who was less rude if we are to speak about rudeness being the issue with rudeness even being mentioned showing that lenin was not in the best of conditions for sure lenin did not mean trotsky who he was famous for being just that after lenin died stalin asked the cc to release him from the position of the general secretary what happened was that all voted against it including trotsky this has a lot to show about trotsky and stalin on stalin s own words on the issue it is said in that will comrade lenin suggested to the congress that in view of stalin s rudeness it should consider the question of putting another comrade in stalin s place as general secretary that is quite true yes comrades i am rude to those who grossly and perfidiously wreck and split the party i have never concealed this and do not conceal it now at the very first meeting of the plenum of the central committee after the thirteenth congress i asked the plenum of the central committee to release me from my duties as general secretary the congress discussed this question it was discussed by each delegation separately and all the delegations unanimously including trotsky kamenev and zinoviev obliged stalin to remain at his post a year later i again put in a request to the plenum to release me but i was obliged to remain at my post stalin was already far more liked trusted and capable than any other in the party it was obvious that in the case of lenin would die stalin would become the leader trotsky tries to paint this as a conspiracy of stalin conspiracy with whom did stalin stay in power for years with the help of the holy spirit we will never know according to bourgeoisie historians one of the seven mysteries of the world to assassinate lenin and to move to the leadership position what trotsky and others miss is that stalin was already the leader in practice he was the most capable of the post he had all the requirements he was already trusted in posts no one was trusted iii factionalism and removal of trotsky and other dividers from the party but lets take things from the start trotskists and the like accuse stalin of banning people from the party trotsky included without legitimacy the people claiming so ignore that lenin was the one that passed the resolution of ban of factions and removing people from the party that were supporting and seeding factionalism all class conscious workers must clearly realise that factionalism of any kind is harmful and impermissible for no matter how members of individual groups may desire to safeguard party unity factionalism in practice inevitably leads to the weakening of team work and to intensified and repeated attempts by the enemies of the governing party who have wormed their way into it to widen the cleavage and to use it for counter revolutionary purposes in order to ensure strict discipline within the party and in all soviet work and to secure the maximum unanimity in eliminating all factionalism the congress authorises the central committee in cases of breach of discipline or of a revival or toleration of factionalism to apply all party penalties including expulsion and in regard to members of the central committee reduction to the status of alternate members and as an extreme measure expulsion from the party there are of course people who claim that lenin intended the ban of factions to be temporary but there are no any evidence to suggest this clearly it can be shown that lenin meant for the ban of factions to be in place as long as enemies were there and through the ussr s history especially the period of which also covers this topic where it was perhaps the most threatening at least in appearance time for ussr with famines attempted counterevolutions and invasion it is ludicrus to claim that the removal of trotsky and other party members on the basis of factionalism and fragmentation of the party was not legitimate it was basically in line with lenin himself therefore any attack against stalin in this topic is also an endorsement of attacks made by the mensheviks syndicalists and the like against lenin on the very same issue the supposed leninists such as trotsky ignore this because it suits them sources mcneal stalin man and ruler lenin at the eleventh congress of the r c p b march april leon trotsky letter on eastman s book stalin the trotskyist opposition before and now lenin at the tenth congress of the r c p b the holodomor the holodomor was a man made famine we are always told but in reality it much more complex than that the thing that triggered the famine was not that stalin took the grain from the ukrainian land owners in fact it was the opposite stalin tried to initiate collectivization but the rich landowners kulaks deliberately burned their stockpiled grain and killed their animals so the soviets wouldn t take them when the crops failed the kulaks didn t have any food left since they burned the food that was supposed to keep them going the famine has been used by western historians especially before so people who didn t have access to the soviet archives to claim that stalin magically killed millions of people one finds estimates anywhere between million to a staggering or million deaths conclusion the holodomor is nazi propaganda and not an actual genocide sources gulags reddit has a cap on how many words can be written and we reached it here is the part on the gulags the constitution few people of the left know about the soviet constitution it was called the stalin constitution by the west in this constitution one does not need to look too much this is the most proggresive constitution of its time and even today it eclipses the today s western democracies we will examine some of the most crucial parts that may interest the reader namely the economy and the elections first the part about economy in the constitution it is stated that there are only two types of property the socialist property i e the state property which is simply the proletariat class organized and the cooperative property the capitalist mode of production of nep was disappeared we are left only with these two modes to which no exploitation of man by man is made the ussr was the only country to achieve this first article the socialist system of economy and the socialist ownership of the means and instruments of production firmly established as a result of the abolition of the capitalist system of economy the abrogation of private ownership of the means and instruments of production and the abolition of the exploitation of man by man constitute the economic foundation of the u s s r article socialist property in the u s s r exists either in the form of state property the possession of the whole people or in the form of cooperative and collective farm property property of a collective farm or property of a cooperative association in addition to these there exists also petty bourgeoisie property where self employed people own their means of production but they cannot employ other people article alongside the socialist system of economy which is the predominant form of economy in the u s s r the law permits the small private economy of individual peasants and handicraftsmen based on their personal labour and precluding the exploitation of the labour of others also it is cleared that ussr is a socialist country yet to reach communism where the principle of to each according to his ability to each according to his need does not apply article in the u s s r work is a duty and a matter of honour for every able bodied citizen in accordance with the principle he who does not work neither shall he eat the principle applied in the u s s r is that of socialism from each according to his ability to each according to his work second part electoral system it is highlighted that all organs of government are elected by the people in a secret ballot each election article members of all soviets of working people s deputies of the supreme soviet of the u s s r the supreme soviets of the union republics the soviets of working people s deputies of the territories and regions the supreme soviets of the autonomous republics the soviets of working people s deputies of autonomous regions area district city and rural stanitsa village hamlet kishlak aul soviets of working people s deputies are chosen by the electors on the basis of universal direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot in all the soviet constitution of was and still is a role model to the socialists of the world the sheer attacks made against it to disprove it or slander it is a proof of the fear the bourgeoisie have on this constitution their fear that this constitution will one day become the constitution of their own countries the great purge some people claim that the great purge was completely unnecessary but in fact it was the opposite without it the ussr would be weak with traitors and opportunists in its ranks here are some of the most notable counter revolutionaries in the ussr first four traitors zinoviev trotsky his son sedon and kamenev they formed an illegal underground bloc to try to sabotage the ussr trotsky was exiled to mexico but the others remained and tried to sabotage the ussr from within after the trials of his comrades trotsky famously denied the existence of the underground bloc claiming instead that it was a fabrication of stalin but evidence including the following letter suggests otherwise letter from sedov to trotsky the is organised it includes the zinovievists the sten lominadze group and the trotskyists former the safar tarkhan group have not yet formally entered they have too extreme a position they will enter very soon the declaration of z and k on the very grave mistake which they made in was made at the time of the negotiations with our people about the bloc just before z and k were deported the collapse of the i n group preobrazh and uf was provoked by a sick partly insane man they arrested him by chance and he began to talk they have certainly found no document in the homes of i n or the others that could be trotskyist literature some days before i n was arrested he told our informant x has betrayed and i am expecting to be arrested from one day to the next the missing word has been cut out with scissors it seems to be the word bloc the missing word has been carefully erased it seems to be capitulators z and k are obviously zinoviev and kamenev capitulated to the party majority instead of siding with trotsky the missing word has been carefully erased it seems to be smirnov preobrazhensky ufimtsev an other traitor yagoda the head of the ogpu and the killer of kirov the best friend of stalin and a very influential politician in before the murder of kirov the terrorist leonid nikolayev was picked up by ogpu agents in leningrad in his possession they found a gun and a chart showing the route which kirov traveled daily when yagoda was notified of nikolayev s arrest he instructed zaporozhetz assistant chief of the leningrad ogpu to release the terrorist without further examination zaporozhetz was one of yagoda s men he did what he was told a few weeks later nikolayev murdered kirov what did he hope to accomplish yagoda had his own ideas about the kind of government whichwould be set up after stalin was overthrown it would be modeled on that of nazi germany he told bulanov yagoda himself would be the leader rykov would replace stalin as secretary of a reorganized party tomsky would be chief of the trade unions which would come under strict military control like the nazi labor battalions the philosopher bukharin as yagoda put it would be dr goebbels now let s talk about bukharin rykov tomsky and tukhachevsky they were planning to coup stalin when the war with nazi germany started also they promised hitler everything germany had in if they recognized their coup how does tukhachevsky visualize the mechanism of the coup that s the business of the military organization tomsky replied he added that the moment the nazis attacked soviet russia the military group planned to open the front to the germans that is to surrender to the german high command this plan had been worked out in detail and agreed upon by tukhachevsky putna gamarnik and the germans in that case said bukharin thoughtfully we might be able to get rid of the bonapartist danger that alarms me tomsky did not understand bukharin went on to explain tukhachevsky would try to set up a military dictatorship he might even try to get popular support by making scapegoats of the political leaders of the conspiracy but once in power the politicians could turn the tables on the military group bukharin told tomsky it might be necessary to try those guilty of the defeat at the front this will enable us to win over the masses by playing on patriotic slogans here is also a pro germany quote from tukhachevsky you are wrong to tie the fate of your country to countries which are old and finished such as france and britain we ought to turn towards new nazi germany germany will assume the leading position on the continent of europe now finally let s talk about yeznov he tried to sabotage the ussr by falsely accusing innocent party members of betraying the revolution and then kicking them out of the party from his trial all of this was done in order to cause in order to cause widespread dissatisfaction in the population with the leadership of the party and the soviet government and in that way to create the most favorable base for carrying out our conspiratorial plans he and his fellow conspirators kicked more than thousand people about of which were innocent and reinstated when everything was discovered by stalin a quote from one of them we endeavored to expel as many people as possible from the party as possible we expelled people when there were no grounds for expulsion we had one aim in view to increase the number the number of embittered people and thus increase the number of our allies speaking about stalin he was always opposed to the number of people kicked out from the party he criticized yeznov a lot on the issue here is a dialogue between them from a central committee plenum june yeznov comrades as a result of the verification of party documents we have expelled more than thousand party members stalin interrupting very many yeznov yes very many i will speak about this stalin interrupting again if we expelled thousand and former trotskyists and zinovievists it would be a bigger victory an other quote from stalin about yeznov after this had all this had ended yeznov is a rat in he killed many innocent people we shot him for that what you might say is that the trials were somehow staged by beria and the nkvd but that is simply not true even the american ambassador to the ussr joseph e davies who was present at the trials of these criminals said they were not staged with an interpreter at my side i followed the testimony carefully naturally i must confess that i was predisposed to the credibility of the testimony of these defendants viewed objectively however and based upon my experience in the trial of cases and the application of the tests of credibility which past experience had afforded me i arrived at the reluctant conclusion that the state had established it s case at least to the extent of proving the existence of a widespread conspiracy and plot among the political leaders against the soviet government conclusion without a purge the ussr would have been weak and unable to fight the fascists stalin wasn t a lunatic or a power hungry politician that purged his opponents he protected the ussr from revisionists and traitors sources ww myths and misconceptions stalin was a bad military general and a coward stalin never left his cabinet at the start of the war as many people would like you to believe by saying he was shocked paralised and did nothing stalin stayed put this is seen by the people he had meetings with at the start of the war on the nd of june he had meetings times starting from am molotov npo deputy prev snk beria nkvd tymoshenko npo mehlis nach glavpur ka zhukov ngs ka malenkov sec central committee of the cpsu b mikoyan deputy prev snk kaganovich nkps voroshilov deputy vyshinsky sotr mfa kuznetsov dimitrov comintern manuilsky kuznetsov mikoyan molotov voroshilov beria malenkov voroshilov mikoyan vyshinsky shaposhnikov deputy tymoshenko zhukov vatutin kuznetsov kulik deputy nco beria this is what vasilevsky had to say about stalin in his memoirs in my deep conviction stalin with the second half of world war ii is the most powerful and colorful figure in the strategic command he successfully carried out the organisation of fronts all the military efforts of the country during the battle of moscow stalin stated that he would stay in the city when the wehrmacht was closing in he had a parade organised for the th anniversary of the october revolution after which troops left off to the frontline which were the outskirts of moscow furthermore most vital plans had stalin coordinating them such as the operations to crush the german th army at stalingrad and the german pincer at kursk stalin s name was even assigned to blows to the germans as stalin s ten blows thus we can conclude that stalin never turned his back on the soviet people and did not break as capitalist leaders did the soviets won only because of order order was issued by stalin only after the red army kept retreating deeper and deeper into the east of the country as stalin states the red army left behind million soviets for the germans to torment rape and pillage it was only a countermeasure and was issued towards the commanders and soldiers of the red army furthermore the germans also punished those who deserted their position without an order from the high command of the wehrmacht could we also assume that the germans conquered all their territory out of fear moving on there were only men behind the frontlines they would not be able to stop entire divisions even if they wanted to in reality most troops were told to return to the frontline or arrested and sent to a military tribunal only in rare cases were they shot while many wetsern movies such as enemy at the gates depict mass friendly fire instances which were never recorded lastly order was abolished by stalin on the th of october which shows us that the soviets did not win the only because of the red army lost more troops compared to the axis powers the soviets only won because of numbers they charged machine gun nests cough cough you mean omaha beach in reality the red army lost around million troops while the axis troops combined lost million troops dead captured however of the million soviets died in captivity while only axis died in captivity furthermore if you look at the frontline in the axis troops outnumber the soviets does that also mean the germans were winning initially just because of their supporierty in numbers if not why does the same not apply to the red army the soviet winter defeated the nazi s it may be true that the soviet winter was cold however one cannot state that the soviets were not affected by the cold as much as the germans furthermore it was the soviets that were always in the offensive during the winter primary examples could be seen during the winter of and where the soviets first launched a counter offensive around moscow and then launched operation uranus around stalingrad beating back the nazi s in both cases some may suggest that the winter actually benefited the wehrmacht as roads would solidify for the mechanized units to push further along after the long muddy season thus we can conclude that the winter was not the main reason for nazi defeat as saying so removes credit from the heroic actions of soviet men and women sources numbers order original cabinet journal for the achievements of stalin stalin s greatest achievements economy created a superpower from a backward agricultural country in just years we have a saying stalin accepted russia with a plow and left with an atomic bomb years is a very small amount of time and yet stalin and the soviet people which were powered by the socilalist economy were able to do this for the first time in history this is humanity s greatest achievement from the soviet population increased by around million people ie million up to even though they went through wars from the average humans age increased from to while the death rate fell from to per people which shows the great emphasis on medical care the ussr had full industrialization of the country around small to large scale factories were built under stalin s five year plans this means that there were factories being built per day most of these factories still run up to this day in the national per capita income was dollars by s standards while in it was already dollars by s dollar value in the share of world industrial products was while by it was the ussr had eliminated homelessness and joblessness for the first time in history of mankind the number of scientists in increased times compared to even though the soviets went though the bloodiest war the human race has ever seen the number of scientific institutions in increased by compared with the number of university students in increased by compared with there were over newly created sovkhozes in the country by alone this number kept rising in the s thousand tractors thousand grain combines and thousand trucks were built and worked in the fields by gross agricultural production in increased by times compared with including grain times raw cotton times sugar beet times sunflower times potatoes times vegetables times keep in mind that the russian empire was a highly agricultural society already soviet cities towns and villages were destroyed by the axis destroyed in that process were million houses farms factories schools libraries hospitals and thousands of kilometers of roads and railway tracks most if not all of which were rebuilt after the war by stalin without the help of the marshall plan which capitalist western europe could not do the british empire crumbled with the help of the us and the war did not affect them as much either social created and was in charge of the first socilist nation in the world gave equal rights to all ethic groups and races gave equal rights to both genders eliminated homelessness and joblessness gave the soviet people free housing free medicine free education foreign achievements was the first to condemn nazi germany and tried to make an alliance with france and britain to combat them offered to send troops to czechoslovakia when the western capitalists sold them out to the nazi s beat back the combined forces of capitalist europe with nazi germany at the forefront in a long year war saving the peoples of eastern europe and the world while showing the might of a planned socialist economy spread socialism to eastern europe and held the imperialists at bay by not accepting the dollar thus saving the people of east of exploitation and dependency towards a more powerful capitalist state helped the chinese communists defeat the imperialist supported chinese nationalists helped the koreans fight off american imperialism and beat them back to the th parallel the legacy of stalin as we have clearly have shown you stalin was a great leader for his time he was also one of the most important marxists ever he turned a feudal country to a world superpower in just years and he continued lenin s legacy that destroyed the nazi invaders both in the east and the west many people mostly bourgeois historians or revisionists lie about him for personal gain do not fall for their propaganda comrades more posts debunking stalin and the ussr

22938,the dprk is continuously cast as a villain in international politics the hermit kingdom is painted as tyrannical repressive and dynastic in this essay i want to argue the opposite north korea is a deeply democratic country and this is reflective of its socialist values contrary to popular belief elections do in fact take place in the dprk bourgeois media such as aj english admit this however they portray the elections in an incredibly dishonest way one report alleged that the elections consist only of a yes no vote on a single candidate selected by the party carried out in view of the public and with the no vote requiring an accompanying written explanation this is at best half true and at worst entirely fabricated here i will argue that the dprk is democratic and its elections are one reason why this is the case before we proceed however we must provide for ourselves a working definition of what democracy actually is it is my opinion that we ought to return to the word itself demos means people while krata is used to mean rule democracy therefore must mean rule by the people this is how the website dictionary com defines the term they write that democracy is government by the people a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system a democracy is a society in which the majority of the people has the ability to make decisions about their political and social life my use of the dictionary here is not meant to imply that dictionaries are the supreme authority on definitions i make use of it simply to avoid accusations that my definition of democracy is ideological i have not invented a definition of democracy that includes the dprk because i want to force you to consider it democratic i have taken a mainstream source whose political agenda is the polar opposite of mine the dprk has county city and provincial elections to the local people s assemblies as well as national elections to the supreme people s assembly their legislature these are carried out every five years candidates are chosen in mass meetings held under the democratic front for the reunification of the fatherland which also organizes the political parties in the dprk citizens run under these parties or they can run as independents they are chosen by the people not by the party in fact the parliament in the dprk consists of three separate parties as of last election the workers party of korea the korean social democratic party and the chondoist chongu party the fact that there is only one candidate on the ballot is because there has already been a consensus reached on who should be up for nomination for that position by the people in their mass meetings this is a truly democratic arrangement as it places power directly in the hands of the people rather than in the hands of wealthy representatives who have no idea how the majority actually live according to one report the median income of a member of the united states congress is times that of the average citizen it is simply impossible for them to understand the struggle of the masses in the dprk by contrast the masses advocate for themselves directly they understand their own interests and are able to advance them openly this is what real democracy entails the dprk does in fact allow foreign observers of their election people vote in a separate room from anyone else and are afforded privacy the mass meetings require input from the popular masses so they are not secret nor should they be since this would impede the democratic process and make it more difficult for the deputies to directly address the needs and demands of the people they are more than votes and ballots they are meetings where the people are given a voice and the power to impact their political system in a meaningful way the central electoral committee is composed of several members of the spa wpk and presidium it is formed by a vote of the presidium the dprk displays extensive political stability and i know of no instances of the candidates chosen by the people being rebuked by any part of the democratic process the elections are effectively a fail safe against any corruption of the democratic process that occurs during the mass meetings the results are therefore expected to show overwhelming support because a no vote indicates the mass meetings failed to reach a consensus with popular support here we see the profound difference in dprk elections and american elections american elections are designed merely to give the illusion of popular participation in government citizens are given a choice effectively between two candidates who both represent the interests of big business it is virtually impossible to break out of the two party system unless one is independently wealthy ross perot for example was only able to run against billionaires because of his status as a billionaire he was only able to break out of the two party system imposed by corporate capitalism because he himself embodied corporate capitalism time and again we see that it is the candidate with the most money who wins elections in the united states in the making of policy it is monied interest groups who get what they want not ordinary working class people despite the veneer of democracy that the us has adopted it is in fact a dictatorship of the capitalist class there is no genuine alternative to the interests of capital which are in reality the interests of a minority of business owners and thus no real democracy in the dprk however democracy flourishes as we have seen they are designed with the explicit goal to empower the popular masses the no vote is a direct result of this it is not evidence of the monopolization of power into the hands of the party but rather evidence of the power of the people no votes arise when the discussions of the masses become too contentious in a certain sense the masses sometimes have too much power the elections exist to mediate this and come to truly democratic conclusions where the will of the majority is enacted the elections are not a barrier to democracy but rather an expression of it citizens in capitalist countries are typically only made aware of one aspect of the election process in the dprk they are led to believe that only one candidate ever appears on the ballot and this is used to paint the dprk as dictatorial the same method of selective reporting could be used to misrepresent western democratic systems if the media only covered the electoral college during an american election for example they could easily assert that just americans were allowed to vote for president this reveals the importance of rigorous research regarding the dprk while there may be elements of truth to western reporting on the dprk they never reveal the whole picture it is vital that we strike out on our own and refuse to trust the bourgeois media in the united states elections though are not the only marker by which democracy is determined the united states has elections but i have just argued that it is undemocratic this must mean that arenas beyond parliament or similar bodies also play a role in determining whether or not a country is democratic in my view an important area to consider when talking about democracy is the economy it is the economy which determines whether or not we stay alive let alone what political forms we adopt it would be virtually impossible to spend a day theorizing about politics if one had to worry about whether or not one would eat that night as such the question of who controls the economy is an important one if a small minority of individuals controls the economy then it follows that the same group has the final say in the politics art and culture of a particular society this can be seen in the united states a minority of the population is made up of wealthy business owners who exercise a huge amount of control over policy they only hold this political power because they have money it is therefore the case that the primary center of power in society is the economy societies can only be considered democratic if the masses of people manage the economy as well as the political sphere this is obviously not the case under capitalism but is it the case in the dprk i would argue that this is the case workplaces in the dprk are managed according to the tean work system which is described this way by country data the highest managerial authority under the taean system is the party committee each committee consists of approximately twenty five to thirty five members elected from the ranks of managers workers engineers and the leadership of working people s organizations at the factory a smaller executive committee about one fourth the size of the regular committee has practical responsibility for day to day plant operations and major factory decisions the most important staff members including the party committee secretary factory manager and chief engineer make up its membership the system focuses on cooperation among workers technicians and party functionaries at the factory level this system has persisted long in the dprk in his new year s address at the thirtieth anniversary of the taean work system kim il sung said the taean work system is the best system of economic management it enables the producer masses to fulfill their responsibility and role as masters and to manage the economy in a scientific and rational manner by implementing the mass line in economic management and by combining party leadership organically with administrative economic and technical guidance the dprk s economy is a dual state owned cooperative economy with workers in the latter constitutionally entitled to ownership of their workplaces according to the constitution of the dprk article the property of social cooperative organizations belongs to the collective property of working people within the organizations concerned social cooperative organizations can possess such property as land agricultural machinery ships medium small sized factories and enterprises the state shall protect the property of social cooperative organizations the korean revolution gave opportunities to workers and landless poor peasants that were unimaginable under the past oppressive conditions korea expert bruce cumings writes at any time before it was virtually inconceivable for uneducated poor peasants to become country level officials or officers in the army but in north korea such careers became normal he also notes that inter class marriages became normal common and widespread with the establishment of democratic korea and educational access opened up for all sectors of society arguably the most important part of the economy is land ownership prior to the revolution land was concentrated in the hands of an astonishingly small japanese elite the worker s party undertook a gradual but steady process of converting private land ownership into cooperative organizations beginning with the process of post war reconstruction in only of peasant households were organized as cooperatives which encompassed a mere of total acreage by august of of peasant households were converted into cooperatives encompassing of total acreage ellen brun an economist whose socialist korea study remains the most comprehensive to date writes that in spite of lack of modern means of production the cooperatives with efficient assistance by the state very early showed their superiority to individual farming eventually convincing formerly reluctant farmers into participating in the movement collectivization was not forced from above but rather an expression of the will of the masses it was and remains a democratic action local people s committees in which any korean worker could participate elected leadership to guide agricultural production and collaborated with national authorities to coordinate nation wide efficiency these people s committees were the primary means by which the party remains in contact with the masses on the various collective farms thus enabling it to gauge public opinion on issues affecting the policies of the country people s committee in the worker s party introduced the group management system which organized groups of ten to twenty five farmers into production units each of which was then put permanently in charge of a certain area of land a certain task or a certain instrument of production this represents another instrument of people s democracy implemented in korean socialist production no serious antagonism between the countryside and industrial centers developed in the process of socialist construction in democratic korea brun notes that tens of thousands of demobiilized men and many junior and senior graduates as well as middle school pupils went to the countryside in the busy seasons and rendered assistance amounting to millions of days of work all voluntarily and without coercion by the state most importantly korean socialist construction reorganized industrial production by and in the interests of the formerly dispossessed korean proletariat drawing on the mass line the marxist leninist organizing method that is both the cause and effect of the politicization and involvement of the masses in the process of economic development and socialist construction the wpk implemented the taean work system described above in december in contrast to the past system in which managers were appointed to oversee a workplace unilaterally by a single party member the party factory committee assumes the highest authority at the level of the enterprise in the taean work system brun further describes this system and i will quote her at length ways of solving questions affecting production and workers activities as well as methods of carrying out decisions are arrived at through collective discussions within the factory committee whose members are elected by the factory s party members to be effective this committee has to be relatively small its precise numbers depending on the size of the enterprise at the daean electrical plant with a labor force of the party factory committee is made up of members who meet once or twice a month while the members of the executive board keep in continuous contact sixty percent of its members are production workers with the remainder representing a cross section of all factory activities including functionaries managers deputy managers engineers technicians women s league representatives youth league members trade union members and office employees its composition thus gives it access to all socioeconomic aspects of the enterprise and the lives of its worker this committee has become what is called the steering wheel of the industrial unit conducting ideological education and mobilizing the workers to implement collective decisions and to fulfill the production target through its connection to the party it has a clear picture of overall policies and aims as well as the exact function of individual enterprise in the national context in other words this setup ensures that politics are given priority workers have input and supremacy in production and interact dialectically with the state to plan and carry out collectivist production on behalf of the whole korean people the fact that the economy is managed often directly by the whole of society is evidence that the country is a democratic one workers are not trapped in top down workplaces to be ordered around as are workers in the united states but rather have a say over what is produced and how it is done the people have a say over the economy and thus a say in all other aspects of life this as i have argued means that the country is vastly more democratic than all capitalist countries even the most advanced many allege that the firm establishment of songun politics a policy the worker s party of korea describes as giving precedence to arms and the military nullifies the aforementioned democratic gains i would like to assert that this is not the case despite western insistence to the novelty of songun politics the official history of the dprk points to the development of songun decades before the dprk was even formed this is important to note because it highlights how an anti imperialist and essentially national liberation struggle has tempered the politics of socialist korea from the very beginning regardless the collapse of the soviet union did bring qualitative changes to the political structure of the dprk notably the national defence commission has become the backbone organ in the state administrative organ and commands all the work of the politics military and economy this can largely be attributed to the unique position the dprk assumed following its de facto isolation internationally in the mid s the fall of the soviet union meant deep economic austerity moreover it meant an emboldened us and comprador south this meant the dprk was forced to pursue a deeply militaristic road of development hence the superiority of the national defence commission and wide dissemination of songun politics ultimately what we see emerge from this s transformation is a unique worker s state conditioned by the intense contradictions between its socialist construction and the ever present threat of imperialist intervention unique not only in its precarious historical predicament but also in the related development of its internal contradictions which no doubt assume an intensely dialectical relationship with parallel external contradictions in light of these contradictions we must examine the organs of class power in the dprk namely the state organs and their relationship with the broader korean people clearly the state organs of the dprk exercise supreme authority over the economy and social life the state constitutionally represents the interests of the working people and thus has legally excluded exploiters and oppressors from formal representation the social system of the dprk is a people centered system under which the working peoples are masters of everything and everything in society serves the working peoples the state shall defend and protect the interests of the workers peasants and working intellectuals who have been freed from exploitation and oppression and become masters of the state and society therefore the political organs of class power have taken become explicitly proletarian organs of class power at least in the sense that is provided constitutionally to the korean people the guiding political force in the dprk remains the worker s party of korea wpk which holds seats in the supreme people s assembly and the de facto leading party in the ruling coalition democratic front for the reunification of the fatherland all koreans over the age of irrespective of race religion sex creed etc are able and encouraged to participate in the organs of state power elections are routinely held for local and central organs of state power being usually people s assemblies which comprise the core of state power in the dprk from which come the standing organs of class power being institutionally the national defence commission and the korean people s army kpa as mentioned earlier the road of songun has meant material developments in the social realities which comprise what the west considers north korea the large emphasis on military advancement and might has only assisted the imperialist detractors in their description of the dprk as a military dictatorship this is at best a surface level analysis it is considered the highest honor for a korean to serve their fatherland in the struggle against imperialism by joining the korean people s army unlike other standing military forces the kpa is definitively involved in the social as well as material construction of socialism in north korea understanding this helps us understand how the unique internal developments of socialist korea created an equally unique expression of class power the people are also closely connected to the leaders of the dprk the party cadres the party cadres are an inescapable feature of north korean political apparatus and are therefore possibly the closest link the korean people have to their formal organs of power cadres as well as party officials and administrators are known to visit workplaces and provide motivation as well as guidance to the working people this is in sharp contrast to the relationship between capitalist politicians and citizens in the capitalist countries politicians are far removed from the people and have no idea what their struggles are like in the dprk the opposite is true because the working class is the vast majority of the population of the dprk roughly seventy percent the management of the state by the working class means that the state is managed by the majority of the people this is consistent with the definition of democracy proposed earlier it is often claimed that none of this matters because north koreans are forced to engage in hard labor for their crimes the state keeps political prisoners according to amnesty international it is the same state that shot dead three north korean citizens who were trying to cross the border into china in late december a more nuanced appraisal of the korean prison system in the north ironically comes from bourgeois liberal historian bruce cumings in his book north korea another country he notes that most claims about the korean penal system are grossly exaggerated for instance he writes that common criminals who commit minor felonies and small fry with an incorrect grasp on their place in the family state who commit low level political offenses go off to labor camps or mines for hard work and varying lengths of incarceration the goal of which is to reeducate them this reflects a materialist understanding of the roots of crime arising in large part from a person s material conditions and incorrect ideas which can change through altering a person s conditions it s important to note that the vast majority of criminals in the korean penal system fall into this category and thus the aim is to rehabilitate and reeducate as opposed to the punitive aims of the american penal system cumings notes the contrast between democratic korea s criminal justice system and that of the united states especially in terms of a prisoner s contact with and support from their family he writes the aquariums of pyongyang is an interesting and believable story precisely because it does not on the whole make for the ghastly tale of totalitarian repression that its original publishers in france meant it to be instead it suggests that a decade s incarceration with one s immediate family was survivable and not necessarily an obstacle to entering the elite status of residence in pyongyang and entrance to college meanwhile we have a long standing never ending gulag full of black men in our prisons incarcerating upward of percent of all black youths it should also be noted that the only north korean ever to escape from a prison camp shin dong hyuk recanted large parts of his story from escape from camp according to a new york times article on the subject mr shin who gives his age as now says that the key fact that set him apart from other defectors that he and his family had been incarcerated at a prison that no one expected to leave alive was only partly true and that he actually served most of his time in the less brutal camp he also said that the torture he endured as a teenager instead happened years later and was meted out for very different reasons similarly the revelation that chemical weapons are used on prisoners in camp has since been proven spurious the story was first invented in the bbc documentary access to evil the documentary featured several interviews with kwon hyok a dprk defector and former head of security at the camp the documentary s evidence for this claim was also based on a letter of transfer supposedly authorizing human experimentation these claims however we entirely manufactured even intelligence agencies in south korea quickly ruled that the documents were forgeries they write first it was revealed that kwon had not been military attache in beijing as claimed next attention was focused on the letter of transfer there were problems with nomenclature size of seals and type of paper joseph koehler a virulent critic of the north came to the conclusion that the document looks like a fake while this is not evidence that every claim by defectors is spurious this does call into question the validity of the story it is not a surprise that defectors would exaggerate their stories given that south korea said on sunday that it would quadruple the cash reward it provides for north korean defectors arriving with important information to billion won or in an effort to encourage more elite members from the north to flee north korean defectors are not simply persecuted individuals seeking a better life they have a direct economic incentive to lie about the country it is important as i said above to verify each story independently rather than blindly trusting them the fact that time in the korean penal system does not result in social castigation like it does in capitalist countries reflects a stark point of contrast with capitalist penal systems using one s family as a support network the state encourages political reeducation and opens opportunities for rehabilitated prisoners to re enter korean society as full citizens the prison system in north korea is far more humane on principle than the system in the united states it is based on a people centered philosophy which holds that criminality is not innate to humanity this is strong evidence that the dprk is a state of the majority and thus democratic the suppression of religion in the dprk a favorite chestnut of the right is also vastly overstated in article by dae young ryu fresh wineskins for new wine a new perspective on north korean christianity begins by noting a new openness of christianity in the s with new churches built a strengthened protestant theological college in pyongyang and an increase in worshippers now put at about although the government itself constructed new churches during this period ryu claims that this is not a recent phenomenon in fact it goes back to christians of the s who adopted marxism leninism and supported the leadership of kim il sung this development is even more remarkable since it took place in a context where christianity was widely viewed as an imperialist american phenomenon indeed evidence indicates that the government tolerated about pro communist christian churches during the s he writes contrary to the common western view it appears that north korean leaders exhibited toleration to christians who were supportive of kim ii sung and his version of socialism presbyterian minister gang ryang uk served as vice president of the dprk from until his death in and kim chang jun an ordained methodist minister became vice chairman of the supreme people s assembly they were buried in the exalted patriots cemetery and many other church leaders received national honors and medals it appears that the government allowed the house churches in recognition of christians contribution to the building of the socialist nation i would like to conclude with an examination of kim il sung and the supposed cult of personality surrounding him the mass grief surrounding his funeral is taken as evidence that he is worshipped as a god in the dprk in reality this grief stemmed from the immense popular support he enjoyed as a leader during and after the revolution kim scorned korea s inability to resist foreign domination the japanese regarded him as a highly able and dangerous guerilla leader going so far as to establish a special anti kim insurgency unit to hunt him down the guerillas were an independent force inspired by a desire to reclaim the korean peninsula for koreans and were controlled by neither the soviets nor chinese while they often retreated across the border into the soviet union to evade japanese counter insurgency forces they received little material help from the soviets unlike the us which imposed a military government and repressed the people s committees the soviets took a fairly hands off approach to their occupation zone allowing a coalition of nationalist and communist resistance fighters to run their own show within seven months the first central government was formed based on an interim people s committee led by kim il sung contrary to popular mythology kim wasn t handpicked by the soviets he enjoyed considerable prestige and support as a result of his years as a guerilla leader and his commitment to national liberation in fact the soviets never completely trusted him eight months into the occupation a program of land reform was begun with landlords dispossessed of their land without compensation but free to migrate to the south or work plots of size equal to those allocated to peasants after a year kim s workers party became the dominant political force major industries most owned by the japanese were nationalized japanese collaborators were purged from official positions citizens of the dprk support kim il sung because of his courageous defiance of u s domination his commitment to the reunification and the real accomplishments of socialism in the face of those who wage war for exploitation and oppression kim s decisions represented the aspirations of korean workers peasants women and children the united korean nation for freedom kim s support was not derived from a cult of personality or taken by force on the contrary he earned the support of his people in struggle indeed there were no mechanisms by which to force the korean people to support kim il sung during his rule lankov writes north koreans in the kim il sung era were not brainwashed automatons whose favorite pastime was goose stepping nor were they closet dissenters neither were they docile slaves who sheepishly followed any order from above kim il sung s dprk was not a police state but rather a democratic and socialist country waging a valiant war against imperialism the korean people were and continue to be unified in struggle and support their leaders on this basis a survey of defectors estimates that more than half of the country they left behind approves of the job leader kim jong un is doing seoul s institute for peace and unification studies as reported by yonhap news agency asked defectors to hazard a guess as to kim s actual approval rating in the country which at least publicly buys into the absolute cult of personality surrounding its leadership just over percent said they think most of the country is behind him in a similar survey in only percent believed kim s father and predecessor kim jong il had the support of the majority of the country as the bbc writes experts put kim jong un s popularity down to efforts improve everyday citizens lives with an emphasis on economic growth light industries and farming in a country where most are believed to be short of food yonhap says there are no opinion polls in the closed communist state where outwardly at least the leader enjoys full and boisterous support though not directly comparable the perceived approval rating outshines those of western leaders a recent mcclatchy poll suggested only of americans back president barack obama s performance while uk prime minister david cameron scored in a recent yougov poll the wall street journal quoting the poll says more than percent of the defectors said people were getting three meals a day up from percent of the previous batch surveyed it points to a successful consolidation of power for the young leader who took over with the death of his father kim jong il in december that seemed uncertain a year ago at least based on the institute s previous report on defector interviews speaking then with people who had fled north korea between january and may it found that were unhappy with the choice of the young mr kim as successor of course people who flee the country may tend to be more dissatisfied with it than people who remain the new leader seems to be tightening his grip with saying society is tightly under control up from in the previous report anti regime leaflets and graffiti are a bit less common but maybe that s the high approval rating at work of the latest group said they d seen such things down from in the survey and in travel to other parts of the country has become more difficult the percentage who reported having done so after rising for five consecutive years to among the defectors interviewed in from among those interviewed in retreated to bourgeois media continues to portray the dprk as a totalitarian nightmare populated exclusively by a pacified and frightened citizenry as i have shown this is far from the case the north korean people have a far greater say in how their lives are structured than do citizens of even the most democratic capitalist countries they are not forced to adhere to a party line handed down from on high but rather are encouraged to participate in the running of society the dprk is an excellent example of socialism which is focused on developing the working class and humanity to its full potential it is only through socialism that we can realize our collective dream of a free and prosperous society the dprk is marching towards this dream even in the face of unparalleled imperialist aggression it is partly on this basis that we should pledge solidarity with the country to reiterate the point i made in my last post however the dprk should be supported regardless of whether it is itself socialist it is standing against imperialism which is the greatest enemy of socialism indirectly or directly the dprk works in the interests of socialism hands off dprk

24222,please come in have a seat and join me in the way back machine as we take a short ride it s late summer and i am full blown into my addiction i find myself a drunkard and homeless i am out of control and spiraling quickly ruth a friend who brought me in off the street and let me sleep on her couch had had it with my drinking she put her foot down either i get help to stop my drinking or get out that meant being back on the street for me sleeping under a bush on the side of the freeway i know it s time to do something about my drinking i am sick and tired of being sick and tired as the old saying goes you see i ve been in this situation before i was sober for eleven and one half years prior to this most recent five year binge ruth told me about the east bay stand down stand down or ebsd being held in the east bay of the greater san francisco bay area set up by the local community to help homeless veterans it was to be held at camp parks reserve forces training area in dublin california beginning september through october i agreed to go to the very first east bay stand down and seek help buses were provided to pick up veterans from certain areas ruth dropped me off on her way to work and i hopped on one of those buses and was whisked off to the stand down in hot dusty dublin california there were a lot of people there both volunteers and veterans i did the check in thing and wandered about for a while there was bottled water provided in buckets of ice so i did avail myself of that it was so hot i can remember the heat of the sun beating down on my head according to old farmer s almanac the temperature reached degrees on september in dublin and i was not wearing a hat mea culpa come around lunchtime i was given a hot dog and while sitting at a picnic table with some other homeless vets just about to take a bite of that hot dog i had either a seizure or suffered heat stroke it started at my feet and quickly overcame me everything just went black i came back to light from the blackness once and found myself strapped down on a stretcher people were gathered round looking at me and someone was asking me questions i blacked out again and then awoke in the hospital where they had hooked me up to an intravenous feed of electrolytes my guess a chartreuse bag of liquid i remember thinking that being a very large bag of fluid to be put into my body and it took two of those bags before i was released from the hospital and sent back to the stand down i was not physically impaired i was walking talking and coherent after receiving care and release from the hospital i can only think that i was perhaps in a mild state of shock because i could not understand what had just happened to me little did i know there was more to come to add to my confusion on this eventful day in the summer of when i returned to camp parks i think it was a v a rep who gave me a ride from the hospital he was my shadow thereafter as he became my personal escort for the duration i was taken into a building where there was a group of about six to ten officials at least one of whom was a woman i say officials because they were all gathered around and talking about what to do with me of all things yes you read that right they were discussing what to do with me i remember the head honcho of the group saying hell no he can t come back here i don t want anyone dying on my watch the head honcho guy was talking about me i had arguably almost died and here he was telling me to go away go die somewhere else i was standing right there he said that literally to my face and everyone else the other officials to their credit argued against the head honcho s decision putting forth the argument that the stand down was about helping veterans and to kick me out is quite contrary to the stated mission of the stand down alas in the end the head honcho prevailed i was labeled persona non grata kicked out of the stand down and taken back to concord and dropped off with application papers to a v a rehabilitation program in hand i can remember the young guy who gave me a ride my shadow asking me about my car he said that in my delirium i had mentioned my car i did not own a car at that time so i must have been really out of it he may have been one of the people standing around when i awoke on the stretcher and i was delirious talking gibberish i do not know i also remember him asking me on the ride back to concord what are you going to do now all i could do was shrug i don t know it was all surreal not only was i confused surprised and perhaps even angry at the time about what had just happened to me i still had to face ruth i must have walked back to ruth s house in pacheco concord and pacheco are neighboring cities needless to say ruth was happy that i had decided to go to the stand down and seek some much needed assistance she really cared about my wellbeing imagine her surprise when she came home and discovered me there i was expected to be gone the whole weekend i told her what had happened and she called me a liar saying the stand down would not do something like that i had to agree with her but it is what it is it happened to me here i am ruth i just lived through it even though i showed her the rehab application and a pair of desert storm boots i had gotten at the stand down before they gave me the heave ho she didn t believe me i also showed her the needle mark from the intravenous feed as far as i know to this day ruth still doesn t believe me or maybe she did we never talked about it again so the east bay stand down offered me help when i was seeking help though when i tried to get that help was told to go away because i can only guess my health was a threat all this happened in one day i got there to the east bay stand down succumbed to the heat or whatever was transported to the hospital unconscious was given an intravenous feed of a chartreuse liquid back to the camp where i was summarily told to leave and then back to ruth s house before she returned home from work overall that day was not one of my best days by a long shot my only saving grace and the reason ruth did not kick me out immediately was that i had the application papers in hand and had committed myself to using them i did fill out the application papers to get into rehab and was accepted and admitted october to the detox at the menlo park v a compound i like to think my name was remembered by some of the people at the stand down that were sticking up for me that day who may have fast tracked my application in order for me to get into the rehab program on such short notice it only took a little over two weeks from the time i was turned away by ebsd i thank you after spending a few days in detox to ensure i didn t have any ill effects from alcohol withdrawal i was admitted into a or day first step program upon completion of first step i was eligible and applied for entrance into homeless veterans rehabilitation program hvrp also in menlo park california at that time a nine month in depth domiciliary program fortunately for me that the v a was there to help me pick up the pieces of my life and get myself back together while a resident in hvrp i heard a staff member make reference to dublin man to a group of residents sitting at a table as i approached the female staff member departed as i joined the table i remember one of the guys saying so you re the dublin man i didn t know what he meant and he was gently quieted by another resident sitting there with us i did not follow up with anyone regarding this and took it to be a reference to the fact that people were talking about the incident that happened at the stand down and i was given that moniker to protect my privacy i was actually embarrassed to talk about it back then did i flop around like a fish when i passed out or did i just slither off the picnic table bench i don t know but to think i may have flopped around was embarrassing now almost years later i don t care after all this time any anger i may have had towards ebsd has evaporated as well i tried to look up dublin man recently on the v a website and did not find anything one would have to surmise that any kind of report regarding my expulsion would have been marked confidential for internal use only i would like to take a moment and point out a couple of things that the stand down was held at camp parks for the first three years and then moved to the alameda county fairgrounds in pleasanton california thereafter they needed more space also i have a vague memory that the woman official came up to me as i was being escorted from the stand down and talked to me i do not remember what was said could this lady be the person who fast tracked my application and spoke about me at hvrp i don t remember it is possible and about whether or not the head honcho is a doctor perhaps one of the other members of the group standing around that day was a doctor or i just plain mis remembered i don t know i realize that after such a long time memories will fade or distort sometimes it feels as if this happened to someone else almost as if this was a dream and yet i did live it so here we are back in the present i decided it was time to see if i could find any information on what happened to me from the stand down s point of view when checking out the ebsd org chart i chose to contact the after action officer the following emails demonstrate my attempt to gather information the first email rehashes my experience already described above and requests assistance from ebsd i include this email for the sake of completeness january at p m hello chelle my name is edward xxxxx i am a marine corps veteran and was a participant of the east bay stand down well kind of a participant i hope you will join me on this short trip on the way back machine and can see your way to help me i am contacting you as the after action officer to see if perhaps you could help me in my quest to finally get some answers to what happened back in for a little background back in i was a full blown alcoholic and on the verge of homelessness again my girlfriend told me either do something about your drinking or get out she meant it i agreed to attend the very first eat bay stand down and seek help for my alcoholism i remember it was in dublin california and it was so hot i succumbed to the heat and fell victim to either a seizure or heat stroke i passed out this was most likely caused by my extensive drinking prior to attending the stand down coupled with the excessive heat of the day i was transported unconscious to a hospital and given intravenous electrolytes it was a nice chartreuse color two bags before i was released i don t even remember which hospital it was i was taken back to the stand down and was put in the midst of a discussion of what to do with me of all things the head honcho said he didn t want me to die on his watch and wanted me gone he literally said that out of the stand down the other people standing around voiced their disagreement saying that the stand down was to help veterans in the end the head honcho guy had his way and i was removed from the stand down taken back to concord and was left on the street by the v a rep with an application for rehab in my hand the v a guy was very nice and apologetic i remember him asking me what are you going to do now i also remember that i just shrugged i don t know well i did fill out those papers for the rehab and have been sober for years not a drop recently i had a discussion with another veteran and this incident in my life was brought back to the forefront of my mind and i would like to find out what happened i know what happened to me i would like to find out what happened to the head honcho and would like to see any reports that refer to me there was a reference while i was in homeless veterans rehabilitation program hvrp in menlo park to dublin man i take that to be a moniker given to me for privacy reasons and would probably have been used in any after action reports i would think whether for the east bay stand down and or the veterans administration i feel that my application for rehab was fast tracked and am eager to find out if that is true as well i think those other people standing around that day arguing with the head honcho kept a look out for my paperwork as the after action officer for east bay stand down do you have access to records of these events or can you point me to where i can find this information i have no desire to open any old wounds and am not looking to sue anyone get anyone in trouble or anything like that i have no ill will towards anyone involved while i am not an attorney i would think any potential liability is way past statute of limitations i only want this information for my own knowledge and maybe will write a story about it here is a link to a short article i wrote in which i had that conversation with another veteran whiskey river it was an emotional moment perhaps the worst thing i still feel from this whole situation is the fact that my girlfriend didn t believe a word of it she called me a liar as all of us think the whole idea of the stand down was help veterans but that day it didn t work out quite that well for me to this day she still thinks i lied about that fantastical event so just for peace of mind if nothing else i would really like to show some proof my telephone number is below if you would like to call me and discuss any assistance you may be able to provide will be greatly appreciated thank you respectfully edward xxxxx xxx xxxx chelle the after action officer was quick to respond and quite nice january at p m hi ed i appreciate your contacting us with questions about your experiences from years ago at our first stand down and i am sorry it was not what you hoped for i have only handled after action for the last years i have no documents or memories of what you have described i am going to forward your email to people who may be able to talk with you if that is ok with you congratulations on years of sobriety that is an awesome achievement chelle january at p m hello chelle thank you i would appreciate your forwarding my message along to anyone that might be of assistance the stand down was my first step towards getting into rehab so it did serve its purpose for me in that respect i did get help and thank you for the pat on the back it s pretty much of a habit nowadays not drinking alcohol respectfully ed i wrote the following thinking that the more information i provided the better things would be it was saturday night and i wanted chelle to see it first thing monday morning i was excited that i was possibly going to find out what the decision making process was back then regarding me was a protocol put in place so it would not happen again i was curious january at p m good morning chelle and happy monday morning there is another bit of information i would like to share with you that may or may not matter to east bay stand down i also reached out to john xxxxx program manager at homeless veterans rehabilitation program hvrp in menlo park front desk xxxx to ask if he could help me in my quest as of this writing john has not returned my calls he s a busy guy or may be on vacation i get it i know john from when he was a staff member at hvrp at the same time i was a resident so i was hoping he could possibly help with any records at hvrp john has been there a long time should it become necessary or advantageous for east bay stand down and the veterans administration whether it be john xxxxx at hvrp or another v a representative to coordinate the gathering of my requested information i hereby consent to that coordination should my consent be required and please let me say again that i would much prefer this be handled in a low key manner no sense in getting people riled up for something that happened almost years ago and after all this time probably no one except me is going to really care all that much because there is a sort of happy ending to this after all i also wanted to assure you that i hold east bay stand down and the veterans administration in the highest regard i believe in what you do and what you stand for helping my brothers and sisters i have had the same doctor at the v a for more years than i can remember now great guy i realize this is not a story that one hears every day and can appreciate any skepticism you or anyone else who may read this are feeling remember my girlfriend called me a liar even when i showed her the needle mark on my arm for the intravenous feed application papers for rehab and some desert storm boots i was allowed to grab before being taken away from the stand down that was a benefit for me i forgot to mention i did get new boots thank you again for taking the time to help me with this and i look forward to hearing from someone soon as always i remain respectfully edward xxxxx semper fi and then boom to my great surprise january at p m ed i am jerry yahiro and was the director of the east bay stand down ebsd i do not recall the incident you related regarding your experience during the ebsd there were some expulsions from the stand down but they were for other reasons other than passing out from whatever the cause s may have been the ebsd because of the privacy of information does not retain or track any of the participants that attend the stand down therefore we do not have any records of the or any ebsds since the after action reports aar s only cover what went well and what improvements could be made no specific incidents are included in the aar s congratulations on being clean and sober for years thank you for your service jerry yahiro east bay stand down can you imagine my excitement when i found out that mr yahiro was there at ebsd years ago and that he was the head honcho then you can perhaps feel my disappointment when i read further that he did not remember how could he not remember something like that i was feeling some intense emotions at this time and did try to keep them in check as i sent the following january at p m hello jerry it is a pleasure meeting you and thank you for responding thank you chelle for forwarding my query wow i do not doubt your veracity when you say you do not recall the incident i would have to conclude that what happened to me was not divulged to you for whatever reason if you are in contact with any of the core group of official staff from back in perhaps you could ask around who was in charge the very first day with enough authority to make that decision regarding me i assure you this truly did occur i appreciate ebsd does not keep records on participants but does ebsd keep records of the expenses of the ebsd someone paid for the ambulance ride and the emergency room visit for me i didn t would you have kept records of that perhaps the v a would have picked up that tab also if you wouldn t mind helping me with these questions perhaps chelle could assist too what were the exact dates for the stand down my experience happened on the first day when lunch was being served because i remember eating a hot dog when i passed out i can t seem to find the exact dates online knowing the dates would help me with the next question which ambulance service and which hospital did the ebsd partner with were these services pro bono or paid for my ebsd or v a the stand down was in dublin so i would think it would be local knowing this will assist me in requesting any records from these organizations is there a possibility that the person who told me to leave the stand down was a v a doctor did you have a counterpart at the time who was a v a doctor i do recall at least one of the people sticking up for me refer to the man as doctor i mentioned to chelle that i had reached out to the v a and have not yet heard back from mr xxxxx i am attempting to get some information from them as well after all it was the veterans administration s application from the stand down that i ultimately completed and submitted as i also mentioned earlier after years i just want to know the whole story it looks like i may have to do some digging i very much appreciate the time you have given me and look forward to your answers to my questions thank you for the kind words jerry i accept them humbly as always i remain respectfully edward xxxxx semper fi after thinking more about mr yahiro s email for a couple of days and receiving no response to my most recent email i felt compelled to send the following to the after action officer which admittedly i should not have done i put chelle in between me and her employer not a good place for her to be and i do apologize to chelle for that hopefully chelle will read this one day and accept my apology january at a m good morning chelle thank you again for forwarding my emails to mr yahiro i have to wonder if mr yahiro is dr yahiro in my naivet i thought pretty much everyone who was involved in my expulsion from the ebsd would be retired or gone now and i would be given a report of the event and all would be hunky dory obviously i was mistaken after mr yahiro s declination of any remembrance of my expulsion it has given me more resolve to find personal closure in this matter i hope you will find it in your heart to answer those questions i posed to mr yahiro i will find the answers eventually it is only a matter of time and effort to request documentation from ambulance and hospital services there are also records at the veterans administration that by law are available to me if you have been told not to assist me i can appreciate your position and wish you no ill will though i will not relent i contend that any attempts at a cover up of my expulsion from the ebsd would be far worse than the expulsion itself with that said chelle i highly recommend you forward all of my correspondence and mr yahiro s letter to legal counsel representing east bay stand down i look forward to hearing from ebsd legal representation soon as always chelle i remain respectfully edward xxxxx semper fi hindsight is always right while i should not have sent the above to chelle i do stand by the content of this email i probably should have explained my reasoning for recommending that my correspondence be forwarded to ebsd legal counsel to wit if i was a disgruntled grunt just trying to cause trouble the lawyers would know how to deal with me and conversely when the lawyers figured out i was a reasonable person asking for some closure they would also know how to manage the situation the after action officer did her job and forwarded my email only not apparently to the legal team to which i received the following january at p m mr xxxxx as i told you in my email message of january due to federal hippa regulations we do not retain any records from past east bay stand down ebsd all records of personnel attending the ebsd are destroyed after each ebsd therefore i cannot help you in your request to provide you any records do what you feel you must do however please cease any further communications with myself or any staff member s of the ebsd respectfully jerry yahiro do what you feel you must do cease any further communications what i understand that all records of participants have been deleted or destroyed according to hippa rules i am not asking for names what about changes made to standard operating procedures after the first stand down was a new protocol put in place to facilitate handling of a similar incident to mine in future stand downs if mr yahiro cannot remember the incident i described then why won t he ask some of the other folks who were there in as i said earlier i did not expect anyone from the stand down to still be around but i was proven wrong in that assumption perhaps there are more folks still around perhaps some of the other directors why won t mr yahiro answer my questions regarding who ebsd partnered with as far as medical and emergency transportation services surely that information has not been destroyed or is protected by hippa rules i feel as if mr yahiro is telling me to go away you are dismissed incidentally mr yahiro s request that i cease any further communications with myself or any staff member s of the ebsd could arguably run afoul of irs code relating to non profits and certainly does not come close to measuring up to the ebsd s own stated mission vis vis helping veterans while i have not specifically requested to see either forms or mr yahiro s request could be taken as denying my rights as a member of the public i stated above my reasoning for recommending that chelle forward all correspondence to east bay stand down s legal counsel this is just another example of why it would have been a good idea in hindsight i should have contacted the legal department myself and still reserve that right notwithstanding mr yahiro s request as of this writing i have not heard from ebsd s legal team one could argue though that contacting the ebsd legal department would be of little use for me anyway because the mandate of the ebsd s legal department would be to protect ebsd and its employees not help some guy find closure on part of his life that ebsd was involved in years ago besides i did not and still do not want to cause any trouble for ebsd john from hvrp and i finally connected and i very much appreciate him giving me some of his time to hear me out while there was no information of me regarding the ebsd in the records available to john there could still be outlying reports of my experience within the v a a freedom of information act foia comes to mind although i have opted to not seek these records at this time john and i discussed a lot of things in the minutes we spoke on the phone i will not go into great detail of what we spoke but his words of wisdom did mean a lot and still do words such as we cannot dwell in the past we cannot predict the future we must try to live in the present well at present as of this writing i feel like i described above as if i were summarily dismissed another conclusion i came to resolve is that i do what is best for me at the present time my peace of mind is what matters i contend to you again that the v a continues to help me pick up the pieces cast aside by ebsd at least the v a will talk to me thank you john just so you understand what i mean this is not about revenge i have said several times that i do not wish any ill will on anyone i only want to know the whole story on what happened regarding my expulsion from the ebsd in at this moment though i do feel resentment resentment that this person mr yahiro basically tells me to go away tells me you are not my concern then or now do not contact me further you do not matter i just have to express myself here i cannot keep my feelings suppressed it is not healthy i ll get over it but yes there are resentments at the present where there were none before i asked for information from ebsd and was rebuked again i would like to pose this question to you if you were part of an arguably life or death decision years ago would you remember it today i do i cannot say definitively whether or not mr yahiro was the head honcho who tossed me out of the stand down and put me back on the streets in though as the self admitted director of ebsd the buck does stop with him i strongly doubt there was anyone else there with the authority to kick me out of the stand down other than the director i hold no ill will towards mr yahiro i never have he was probably doing what he thought best for the east bay stand down i will give mr yahiro the benefit of the doubt and have to believe that he has never again denied anyone else in the way i was denied i want to believe that i am the first and only person to have been expelled from the ebsd because of illness or the threat of illness or even death not for reasons of misconduct as mr yahiro obliquely refers to in his first email response to me perhaps ebsd has received complaints from some of those expelled veterans and think i may be one of them they would be wrong i will say fairly certainly that ebsd has not received an email like mine ever before and i hope they never will again i can imagine a scenario wherein i was expelled from the stand down because there was no protocol in place to prepare anyone for what happened that day maybe the head honcho freaked out maybe the head honcho didn t know what to do i did almost die that day it would certainly not look good if i had died perhaps contributions would not be as forthcoming for future events as they were for the first stand down i can also imagine that there was probably no one there to keep an eye on me for the whole weekend in case i had another bout of heat stroke or something and perhaps the liability was too great for them to keep me there all understandable and perhaps even reasonable i can accept this type of reasoning at this point in my life although it would be nice to hear from someone who was there you know something like yeah we kind of blew it sorry dude we did not and will not let it happen again to another vet we re so glad everything came out okay for you even though i did not request or want an apology when i began to ask questions of ebsd i only wanted information chelle did apologize in her response to me that was very much appreciated and yet she wasn t even there in another thing i keep thinking about those other officials who were standing around sticking up for me when the head honcho guy was giving me the boot what about that young v a guy who had to give me a ride back to concord he felt so bad for me and i am sure he was very embarrassed and ashamed to be the one to actually drop me back off in the streets i remember it was a very quiet ride back to concord about an hour and a half neither one of us was really interested in small talk what about those guys sitting at the picnic table when i passed out do they ever wonder what happened i m guessing here but i am pretty sure those guys must have really freaked out seeing someone pass out and go down while you re having lunch doesn t happen every day i keep thinking it would be nice if they knew that guy at the stand down back in made it he s still alive he got the help he was denied by ebsd and has been sober and productive for almost years don t those folks deserve to know is it fair to keep them in the dark for them to maybe continue thinking about that guy they were not allowed to help can we now clear their conscience if they don t already know where is the compassion for those people maybe just maybe one or two of these folks too will read this one day it is my hope regardless of the fact that i perceive ebsd and mr yahiro to be very dismissive towards me and my requests for information i am all for what ebsd does i like and appreciate that they help veterans and their families and mr yahiro is obviously very good at what he does he s been there for years after all in fact during my research in writing this essay i found that mr yahiro and a group of others started east bay stand down in order to help vets mr yahiro is a co founder of east bay stand down and i think he is a veteran himself how can i not admire that thank you all staff and volunteers of east bay stand down for helping my brothers and sisters who have put on the uniform of the united states military speaking of research i finally found the dates for the east bay stand down on country joe a timeline of the country joe and the fish band website of all places the dates were difficult for me to find open the website and click on then go to september and it shows country joe played at the stand down for the whole weekend entertaining the troops i just thought i would share that tidbit with you also in the way of research i have decided to not seek documents from the hospital or ambulance service at this time the same goes for any foia requests to the v a what good would they do me now anyway mr yahiro and the east bay stand down know that i am still alive and i will tell my story before i close i would like to bring up the idea of you create what happens to you i was reminded of this when i visited the hvrp website one could argue that if i wasn t a homeless alcoholic i would not have been in that position in the first place that argument has merit i ll own it i have always taken responsibility for my actions always one could also argue that if east bay stand down did not extend their hand to me i would not have been there in the first place either it just didn t work out did it finally east bay stand down proudly displays on its website home page standown is a term used during war to describe the practice of removing combat troops from the field and taking care of their basic needs in a safe area we don t leave our wounded behind and this one as well a community is often judged by how well it takes care of its own serving those who have served our nation is the primary goal of the east bay stand down i certainly feel left behind at this point in time without any input from the ebsd to make me believe otherwise i feel as if i have been summarily dismissed discarded and denied taking care of their basic needs in a safe area i was not given a safe haven i was put back into the field and now almost years later there again will be no assistance for this united states marine from the ebsd it is not my place to judge anyone i have made many mistakes in my life two times i have reached out my hand to east bay stand down for help and my pleas have been twice denied i have unloaded a lot today it feels good to put forth my story i have not spoken of this to very many people in the past years in telling this story i do not seek a pat on a the back pity sorrow thanks or any such thing from you the reader i only wanted to know why east bay stand down made the decision that was made and to get this off my chest so to speak was the decision to send me away as i speculated above i believe so people freaked and didn t know what to do do i blame anyone no i will probably never know the full story as mr yahiro and ebsd refuse to answer my questions and have told me to not contact them again i do take great solace in knowing that there are others who were there that day september who know that what i have laid out for you above is a true story and yet i cannot help but feel a bit of resentment as well east bay stand down and mr yahiro they really did leave me behind then and summarily dismiss me today notwithstanding the great work they have done and will continue to do for others how does one reconcile that semper fidelis

maxwell and epstein participated in multiple threesomes with virginia giuffre the butler for defendant s close friend witnessed first hand a fifteen year old swedish girl crying and shaking because defendant was attempting to force her to have sex with epstein and she refused call this the yes i m a sextrafficker but only of sixteen year old girls defense page flight logs even reveal twenty three flights that defendant shared with ms giuffre although defendant claims she is unable to remember even a single one of those flights defendant s heavy and extensive involvement in both jeffrey epstein s sex trafficking ring and in recruiting ms giuffre living with her and jeffrey epstein in the same homes while ms giuffre was a minor and traveling with ms giuffre and jeffrey epstein including documented flights even the house staff testified that defendant and ms giuffre were regularly together page the record evidence in this case shows that defendant shared a household with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein for many years while there she actively took part in recruiting underage girls and young women for sex with epstein as well as scheduling the girls to come over and maintaining a list of the girls and their phone numbers ms giuffre was indisputably a minor when defendant recruited her to have sex with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein thereafter ms giuffre flew on epstein s private jets the lolita express with defendant at least times ms sjoberg s account of her experiences with defendant are chillingly similar as with ms giuffre defendant a perfect stranger approached ms sjoberg while trolling ms sjoberg s school grounds she lured ms sjoberg into her and epstein s home under the guise of a legitimate job of answering phones a pretext that lasted only a day a young college student case document page of nearly miles from home defendant soon instructed ms sjoberg to massage epstein and made it clear that sjoberg s purpose was to bring epstein to orgasm during these massages so that defendant did not have to do it page ms sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her prince andrew and ms giuffre when she and defendant were staying

testified that when ms giuffre started living with defendant defendant became ms giuffre s new momma incredulously defendant testified that she barely remembered ms giuffre detective recarey led the palm beach police s investigation of epstein he testified that defendant procured girls for epstein and that he sought to question her in relation to his investigation but could not contact her due to the interference of epstein s lawyer page notably at defendant s deposition defendant refused to admit that she flew with ms giuffre and denied that she appeared on epstein s pilot s flight logs however david rodgers epstein pilot testified that the passenger listed on his flight logs bearing the initials gm was in fact ghislaine maxwell and that he was the pilot on at least flights in which defendant flew with plaintiff the dates of those flights show that ms giuffre was an underage child on many of them when she flew with defendant both sarah kellen and nadia marcinkova lived with jeffrey epstein for many years they both invoked the fifth amendment when asked about defendant s participation in recruiting underage girls for sex with epstein page jeffrey epstein invoked the fifth amendment when asked about defendant s involvement in procuring underage girls for sex with him page defendant has not been able to procure a single witness not one to testify that defendant did not procure girls for sex with epstein or participate in the sex even one of her own witnesses tony figueroa testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex another one of defendant s witnesses ms giuffre s mother named defendant as ms giuffre s new mamma indeed those who knew her well who spent considerable time with her in epstein s shared household like juan alessi alfredo rodriguez and joanna sjoberg have testified that she was epstein s procuress others who lived with her jeffrey epstein nadia marcinkova and sarah kellen invoked the fifth amendment so as not to answer questions on the same no one has testified to the contrary defendant has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with and why she was traveling with a minor child on flights while she was a child including international flights aboard a convicted pedophile s private jet all over the world page defendant never offered an explanation regarding ms giuffre s photographs of her defendant and epstein she never offered a legal explanation for why prince andrew was photographed with his hand around ms giuffre s bare waist while she was a minor child while posing with defendant inside defendant s house in london this photograph corroborates ms giuffre s claims and there is no other reasonable explanation why an american child should be in the company of adults not her kin in the london house owned by the girlfriend of a now convicted sex offender ms giuffre also produced pictures of herself taken when she was in new york with defendant and epstein and from a trip to europe with defendant and epstein page ms giuffre has produced a number of pictures of herself taken at the zorro ranch epstein s new mexico ranch among other nude photos which included full nudes of defendant ms giuffre produced images of females that the palm beach police confiscated during the execution of the see mccawley dec at exhibit giuffre case document page of warrant including one photograph revealing the bare bottom of a girl who appears to be prepubescent page in the united states attorney s office for the southern district of florida identified ms giuffre as a protected victim of jeffrey epstein s sex abuse the u s attorney mailed ms giuffre a notice of her rights as a crime victim under the cvra ms giuffre has provided extensive medical records in this case including medical records from the time when defendant was sexually abusing and trafficking her ms giuffre produced records supporting her claim of being sexually abused in new york resulting in both see mccawley dec at exhibit giuffre see mccawley dec at exhibit giuffre victim notification letter case document page of defendant and epstein taking plaintiff to new york presbyterian hospital in new york while she was a minor the dates on the hospital records show she was seventeen years old page defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of ms giuffre s medical history defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of ms giuffre s medical history defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice ms giuffre sought counseling from a psychologist for the trauma she continued to experience after being abused by defendant and epstein a psychological treatment record written by her treating psychologist unambiguously describes defendant as ms giuffre s abuser page years before defendant defamed her ms giuffre confided in her treating psychologist that maxwell recruited her for sex with epstein detective recarey the lead investigator of the criminal investigation into epstein and his associates sex crimes recovered carbon copies of hand written messages taken by various staff including defendant at epstein s palm beach residence the messages raise a question of fact as to maxwell s involvement in the sexual abuse of minors and are relevant to refute maxwell s denial of any involvement with epstein during relevant time periods and accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events page messages reveals that maxwell gm took messages at the residence including from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see epstein page one message pad reflects who is identified in the palm beach police report as a minor contacting jeffrey epstein for work explaining that she does not have any money the term work was often used by members of jeffrey epstein s sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual massages giuffre july th no year to je from i need work i mean i don t have money do you have some work for me other message pads reflect who was a minor calling and leaving a message at the palm beach mansion that she has recruited another girl for jeffrey epstein the second message demonstrates that jeffrey epstein required different girls to be scheduled every day of the week the third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the home at the same time to provide sexual massages these type of messages indicate the lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were visiting every day and at least raises a question of fact whether maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as giuffre has said or whether giuffre was lying and maxwell was not at all involved or aware of this activity as defendant would attempt to have the world believe giuffre undated jeffrey from has girl for tonight giuffre pictured above mr epstein from is available on tuesday

retrieve a fraction of these message pads during their trash pull but even in the few they recovered it shows maxwell was regularly at the palm beach home during the time period she claimed she was not to the contrary she was both sending and receiving messages and messages like this one reflect her presence at the mansion giuffre during the year maxwell says she was never around je from i went to sarah and made her water bottle and i went to work out with gm these message pads further corroborate that defendant lied in her testimony and she was in fact in regular contact with jeffrey epstein during the years and for example the message from larry demonstrates that defendant is at the palm beach mansion so frequently that people including epstein s main pilot larry visoski are leaving messages for maxwell at the palm beach house giuffre mr epstein from ms maxwell tell him to call me giuffre je from gm giuffre for ms maxwell from larry returning your call this message pad

message pad reflects the pattern and practice of having young girls bring other young girls to the house to perform sexual massages indeed the reflected in this message pad corresponds in name to the that tony figueroa testified he initially brought to jeffrey epstein during the time period that the defendant was requesting that tony find some young females to bring to jeffrey epstein s home see figueroa at the palm beach police report reflects that and also brought seventeen year old to the home to perform sexual massages see giuffre thereafter recruited a number of other young girls to perform sexual case document page of massages as reflected in the palm beach police report giuffre pictured above je from wants to know if she should bring her friend with tonight this message pad reflects multiple sexual massages being scheduled for the same day which corroborates virginia giuffre and johanna sjorberg s testimony that jeffrey epstein required that he have multiple orgasms in a day which occurred during these sexual massages giuffre pictured above je from i left message for to confirm for a m and for p m this message pad shows a friend of jeffrey epstein s discussing with

enforcement was able to confirm identities of underage victims through the use of the names and telephone numbers in these message pads page the black book palm beach police confiscated an extensive lists of contacts with their phone numbers form defendant and epstein s residence ghislaine maxwell maintained a contact list in an see mccawley dec at exhibit recarey dep tr at case document page of

employees or personal or business connections of epstein or defendant prior to being terminated by defendant the palm beach house butler alfredo rodriguez printed a copy of this document and ultimately provided it to the fbi this document reflects the numerous phone numbers of defendant epstein as well as staff phone numbers additionally and importantly there are several sections entitled massage alongside a geographical designation with names of females and corresponding telephone numbers these numbers included those of underage females with no training in massage therapy including identified during the criminal investigation of epstein this document is an authentic reflection of the people who were associated with epstein defendant and the management of their properties and the

25571,today is stalin s birthday and we have decided to make a mater post about him his accomplishments and debunking some of the lies about him this post was created by the central committee of r europeansocialists in particular u bolshevikshqiptar u soviet odarin u jmlsky u user name ofcl this master post is divided into parts the rise of stalin debunking trotsky the holodomor gulags the constitution and the elections the great purge ww lies and propaganda the accomplishments of the ussr under him the legacy of stalin the rise of stalin debunking trotsky many are the slanders against stalin and even more are the myths surrounding him and the ussr epsecially during his tenure as the general secretary of the cpsu many lies also surround his rise to power and his faction s conflict with trotskye s even today many leftists still believe that stalin was somehow an ussurper and that trotsky was the rightfull whatever that means successor of lenin i stalin during the civil war and the first years of the soviet government it is many times painted that stalin played a minimal role in the civil war and in the first years of the soviet union or even a negative role leave aside that he was one of the first bolsheviks contrary to trotsky who only entered the bolsheviks in stalin was a close ally of lenin since writing the book marxism and the national question and also doing real revolutionary work by attacking banks for the sake of the revolution if stalin was not so famous during the revolution in the masses was because he was in the gulag for about a decade right before he was freed in a little before the revolution but let s examine the facts it is impossible that stalin did not enjoyed support from the party since the very beginning he was one of the ministers since the first days of the october revolution he was the editor of pravda before the revolution even occurred therefore it is illogical to even claim that stalin was mediocre as trotsky wrote during the first days after the revolution even bourgeoisie historians such as montefiore describe that lenin stalin sverdlov and trotsky were the four most powerful bolsheviks how could stalin be relatively irrelevant while he was a high member of the bolsheviks and this means he enjoyed support since the very beginnings after the revolution during the civil war stalin was sent to many important posts where he unmasked many traitors who were working for the white army some of them were also on good terms with trotsky bourgeoisie historian robert h mcneal wrote stalin had emerged as a political military chief whose contribution to the red victory was second only to trotsky s stalin had played a smaller role than his rival in the overall organizationof the red army but he had been more important in providing direction on crucial fronts if his reputation as a hero was far below trotsky s this had less to do with objective merit than with stalin s lack of flair for self advertisement during the preparations for the polish soviet war stalin argued against the war as unrealistic after the defeat of the soviets in the war to which stalin was a general in the front most bolsheviks agreed with stalin that indeed the war was a mistake unfortunately it was too late due to his actions during the war plus his previous involvement before the revolution stalin had achieved high prestige he held two commissariats one of the nationalities and one of the workers and peasants inspections when another high bolshevik yevgeni preobrazhensky who was later a trotskyist and a member left opposition complained against stalin holding these positions lenin himself replied what can we do to preserve the present situation in the people s commissariat of nationalities to handle all the turkestan caucasian and other questions these are all political questions they have to be settled these are questions that have engaged the attention of european states for hundreds of years and only an infinitesimal number of them have been settled in democratic republics we are settling them and we need a man to whom the representatives of any of these nations can go and discuss their difficulties in all detail where can we find such a man i don t think comrade preobrazhensky could suggest any better candidate than comrade stalin the same thing applies to the workers and peasants inspection this is a vast business but to be able to handle investigations we must have at the head of it a man who enjoys high prestige otherwise we shall become submerged in and overwhelmed by petty intrigue all this implies that even lenin considered stalin obviously a first rate bolshevik if trotskyists or any other person wants to present stalin as a mediocre and a second rate bolshevik then it can be said that lenin himself was also a mediocrity and a second rate bolshevik for having such a good opinion of stalin and entrusting him with such crucial tasks ii lenin s testament lenin indeed wrote a letter but it was not a will and it could not be because the party was not lenin s plaything nor lenin was the king of it so this exposes the mentality and the very un marxist thinking of the people who tried to refute stalin on the grounds of this testament before anything it must be asserted that stalin was the second more powerful if not the most at around now the question around on the word power power comes from somewhere in this case stalin was chosen to by these people he was appointed who vested this power in his shoulders to represent them in he was the only person who as a member of both the politburo the orgburo the central committee and the secretariat he was also the man responsible for lenin s relations with the doctors the doctors had ordered that lenin must not be bothered by political matters as this would make him lose the peace needed to recover stalin sough to obey this order for lenin s sake but lenin s wife passed information to lenin bypassing the orders of the doctors stalin angry at this verbally attacked lenin s wife on the phone when lenin heard this he became very angry at stalin therefore the contents of the letter need to take in light this personal anger of lenin at the time when the writings became famous to the west and many anti communists attacked stalin in and that the bolsheviks were hiding this will trotsky responded at the time eastman asserts in several places that the central committee has concealed from the party a large number of documents of extraordinary importance written by lenin during the last period of his life the documents in question are letters on the national question the famous testament etc this is pure slander against the central committee of our party eastman s words convey the impression that lenin wrote these letters which are of an advisory character and deal with the inner party organization with the intention of having them published this is not at all in accordance with the facts if all of these letters have not been published it is because their author did not intend them to be published comrade lenin has not left any testament the character of his relations to the party and the character of the party itself preclude the possibility of such a testament the bourgeois and menshevik press generally understand under the designation of testament one of comrade lenin s letters which is so much altered as to be almost unrecognizable in which he gives the party some organizational advice the thirteenth party congress devoted the greatest attention to this and to the other letters and drew the appropriate conclusions all talk with regard to a concealed or mutilated testament is nothing but a despicable lie directed against the real will of comrade lenin and against the interests of the party created by him eastman s assertions that the central committee confiscated my pamphlets and articles in or or at any other time or by any other means has prevented their publication are untrue and are based on fantastic rumors eastman is again wrong in asserting that comrade lenin offered me the post of chairman of the council of people s commissars and of the council of labor and defense i hear of this for the first time from eastman s book the funny part is that this is true lenin was neither a despot nor the party his personal guard to follow wills now if trotsky and his supporters ignore this in favor of an explanation such as trotsky was forced to write this by stalin and if we take that what trotsky wrote is not true and that trotsky wrote it under pressure then this gives us a very strong info about these people they thought lenin as a king the party as his plaything whoever agrees with the narrative pushed about the will he is fundamentally against the principles lenin himself supported which is democractic centralism therefore if someone is trying to paint what trotsky himself wrote he attacks both lenin the viability of democratic centralism and the historical facts of stalin growing to become the leader of the party little by little by his own contribution as a bolshevik as a pupil of lenin and this was manifested to the appointments of him by the whole party in positions of power now one needs to consider what the contexts around the letter is the context is lenin as a sick paralyzed man who was angry at stalin for speaking badly against his wife on the phone and who lenin himself never spoke on the letter about any successor he pointed that stalin was a perfect general secretary and he would be replaced by someone who was less rude if we are to speak about rudeness being the issue with rudeness even being mentioned showing that lenin was not in the best of conditions for sure lenin did not mean trotsky who he was famous for being just that after lenin died stalin asked the cc to release him from the position of the general secretary what happened was that all voted against it including trotsky this has a lot to show about trotsky and stalin on stalin s own words on the issue it is said in that will comrade lenin suggested to the congress that in view of stalin s rudeness it should consider the question of putting another comrade in stalin s place as general secretary that is quite true yes comrades i am rude to those who grossly and perfidiously wreck and split the party i have never concealed this and do not conceal it now at the very first meeting of the plenum of the central committee after the thirteenth congress i asked the plenum of the central committee to release me from my duties as general secretary the congress discussed this question it was discussed by each delegation separately and all the delegations unanimously including trotsky kamenev and zinoviev obliged stalin to remain at his post a year later i again put in a request to the plenum to release me but i was obliged to remain at my post stalin was already far more liked trusted and capable than any other in the party it was obvious that in the case of lenin would die stalin would become the leader trotsky tries to paint this as a conspiracy of stalin conspiracy with whom did stalin stay in power for years with the help of the holy spirit we will never know according to bourgeoisie historians one of the seven mysteries of the world to assassinate lenin and to move to the leadership position what trotsky and others miss is that stalin was already the leader in practice he was the most capable of the post he had all the requirements he was already trusted in posts no one was trusted iii factionalism and removal of trotsky and other dividers from the party but lets take things from the start trotskists and the like accuse stalin of banning people from the party trotsky included without legitimacy the people claiming so ignore that lenin was the one that passed the resolution of ban of factions and removing people from the party that were supporting and seeding factionalism all class conscious workers must clearly realise that factionalism of any kind is harmful and impermissible for no matter how members of individual groups may desire to safeguard party unity factionalism in practice inevitably leads to the weakening of team work and to intensified and repeated attempts by the enemies of the governing party who have wormed their way into it to widen the cleavage and to use it for counter revolutionary purposes in order to ensure strict discipline within the party and in all soviet work and to secure the maximum unanimity in eliminating all factionalism the congress authorises the central committee in cases of breach of discipline or of a revival or toleration of factionalism to apply all party penalties including expulsion and in regard to members of the central committee reduction to the status of alternate members and as an extreme measure expulsion from the party there are of course people who claim that lenin intended the ban of factions to be temporary but there are no any evidence to suggest this clearly it can be shown that lenin meant for the ban of factions to be in place as long as enemies were there and through the ussr s history especially the period of which also covers this topic where it was perhaps the most threatening at least in appearance time for ussr with famines attempted counterevolutions and invasion it is ludicrus to claim that the removal of trotsky and other party members on the basis of factionalism and fragmentation of the party was not legitimate it was basically in line with lenin himself therefore any attack against stalin in this topic is also an endorsement of attacks made by the mensheviks syndicalists and the like against lenin on the very same issue the supposed leninists such as trotsky ignore this because it suits them sources mcneal stalin man and ruler lenin at the eleventh congress of the r c p b march april leon trotsky letter on eastman s book stalin the trotskyist opposition before and now lenin at the tenth congress of the r c p b the holodomor the holodomor was a man made famine we are always told but in reality it much more complex than that the thing that triggered the famine was not that stalin took the grain from the ukrainian land owners in fact it was the opposite stalin tried to initiate collectivization but the rich landowners kulaks deliberately burned their stockpiled grain and killed their animals so the soviets wouldn t take them when the crops failed the kulaks didn t have any food left since they burned the food that was supposed to keep them going the famine has been used by western historians especially before so people who didn t have access to the soviet archives to claim that stalin magically killed millions of people one finds estimates anywhere between million to a staggering or million deaths conclusion the holodomor is nazi propaganda and not an actual genocide sources gulags reddit has a cap on how many words can be written and we reached it here is the part on the gulags the constitution few people of the left know about the soviet constitution it was called the stalin constitution by the west in this constitution one does not need to look too much this is the most proggresive constitution of its time and even today it eclipses the today s western democracies we will examine some of the most crucial parts that may interest the reader namely the economy and the elections first the part about economy in the constitution it is stated that there are only two types of property the socialist property i e the state property which is simply the proletariat class organized and the cooperative property the capitalist mode of production of nep was disappeared we are left only with these two modes to which no exploitation of man by man is made the ussr was the only country to achieve this first article the socialist system of economy and the socialist ownership of the means and instruments of production firmly established as a result of the abolition of the capitalist system of economy the abrogation of private ownership of the means and instruments of production and the abolition of the exploitation of man by man constitute the economic foundation of the u s s r article socialist property in the u s s r exists either in the form of state property the possession of the whole people or in the form of cooperative and collective farm property property of a collective farm or property of a cooperative association in addition to these there exists also petty bourgeoisie property where self employed people own their means of production but they cannot employ other people article alongside the socialist system of economy which is the predominant form of economy in the u s s r the law permits the small private economy of individual peasants and handicraftsmen based on their personal labour and precluding the exploitation of the labour of others also it is cleared that ussr is a socialist country yet to reach communism where the principle of to each according to his ability to each according to his need does not apply article in the u s s r work is a duty and a matter of honour for every able bodied citizen in accordance with the principle he who does not work neither shall he eat the principle applied in the u s s r is that of socialism from each according to his ability to each according to his work second part electoral system it is highlighted that all organs of government are elected by the people in a secret ballot each election article members of all soviets of working people s deputies of the supreme soviet of the u s s r the supreme soviets of the union republics the soviets of working people s deputies of the territories and regions the supreme soviets of the autonomous republics the soviets of working people s deputies of autonomous regions area district city and rural stanitsa village hamlet kishlak aul soviets of working people s deputies are chosen by the electors on the basis of universal direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot in all the soviet constitution of was and still is a role model to the socialists of the world the sheer attacks made against it to disprove it or slander it is a proof of the fear the bourgeoisie have on this constitution their fear that this constitution will one day become the constitution of their own countries the great purge some people claim that the great purge was completely unnecessary but in fact it was the opposite without it the ussr would be weak with traitors and opportunists in its ranks here are some of the most notable counter revolutionaries in the ussr first four traitors zinoviev trotsky his son sedon and kamenev they formed an illegal underground bloc to try to sabotage the ussr trotsky was exiled to mexico but the others remained and tried to sabotage the ussr from within after the trials of his comrades trotsky famously denied the existence of the underground bloc claiming instead that it was a fabrication of stalin but evidence including the following letter suggests otherwise letter from sedov to trotsky the is organised it includes the zinovievists the sten lominadze group and the trotskyists former the safar tarkhan group have not yet formally entered they have too extreme a position they will enter very soon the declaration of z and k on the very grave mistake which they made in was made at the time of the negotiations with our people about the bloc just before z and k were deported the collapse of the i n group preobrazh and uf was provoked by a sick partly insane man they arrested him by chance and he began to talk they have certainly found no document in the homes of i n or the others that could be trotskyist literature some days before i n was arrested he told our informant x has betrayed and i am expecting to be arrested from one day to the next the missing word has been cut out with scissors it seems to be the word bloc the missing word has been carefully erased it seems to be capitulators z and k are obviously zinoviev and kamenev capitulated to the party majority instead of siding with trotsky the missing word has been carefully erased it seems to be smirnov preobrazhensky ufimtsev an other traitor yagoda the head of the ogpu and the killer of kirov the best friend of stalin and a very influential politician in before the murder of kirov the terrorist leonid nikolayev was picked up by ogpu agents in leningrad in his possession they found a gun and a chart showing the route which kirov traveled daily when yagoda was notified of nikolayev s arrest he instructed zaporozhetz assistant chief of the leningrad ogpu to release the terrorist without further examination zaporozhetz was one of yagoda s men he did what he was told a few weeks later nikolayev murdered kirov what did he hope to accomplish yagoda had his own ideas about the kind of government whichwould be set up after stalin was overthrown it would be modeled on that of nazi germany he told bulanov yagoda himself would be the leader rykov would replace stalin as secretary of a reorganized party tomsky would be chief of the trade unions which would come under strict military control like the nazi labor battalions the philosopher bukharin as yagoda put it would be dr goebbels now let s talk about bukharin rykov tomsky and tukhachevsky they were planning to coup stalin when the war with nazi germany started also they promised hitler everything germany had in if they recognized their coup how does tukhachevsky visualize the mechanism of the coup that s the business of the military organization tomsky replied he added that the moment the nazis attacked soviet russia the military group planned to open the front to the germans that is to surrender to the german high command this plan had been worked out in detail and agreed upon by tukhachevsky putna gamarnik and the germans in that case said bukharin thoughtfully we might be able to get rid of the bonapartist danger that alarms me tomsky did not understand bukharin went on to explain tukhachevsky would try to set up a military dictatorship he might even try to get popular support by making scapegoats of the political leaders of the conspiracy but once in power the politicians could turn the tables on the military group bukharin told tomsky it might be necessary to try those guilty of the defeat at the front this will enable us to win over the masses by playing on patriotic slogans here is also a pro germany quote from tukhachevsky you are wrong to tie the fate of your country to countries which are old and finished such as france and britain we ought to turn towards new nazi germany germany will assume the leading position on the continent of europe now finally let s talk about yeznov he tried to sabotage the ussr by falsely accusing innocent party members of betraying the revolution and then kicking them out of the party from his trial all of this was done in order to cause in order to cause widespread dissatisfaction in the population with the leadership of the party and the soviet government and in that way to create the most favorable base for carrying out our conspiratorial plans he and his fellow conspirators kicked more than thousand people about of which were innocent and reinstated when everything was discovered by stalin a quote from one of them we endeavored to expel as many people as possible from the party as possible we expelled people when there were no grounds for expulsion we had one aim in view to increase the number the number of embittered people and thus increase the number of our allies speaking about stalin he was always opposed to the number of people kicked out from the party he criticized yeznov a lot on the issue here is a dialogue between them from a central committee plenum june yeznov comrades as a result of the verification of party documents we have expelled more than thousand party members stalin interrupting very many yeznov yes very many i will speak about this stalin interrupting again if we expelled thousand and former trotskyists and zinovievists it would be a bigger victory an other quote from stalin about yeznov after this had all this had ended yeznov is a rat in he killed many innocent people we shot him for that what you might say is that the trials were somehow staged by beria and the nkvd but that is simply not true even the american ambassador to the ussr joseph e davies who was present at the trials of these criminals said they were not staged with an interpreter at my side i followed the testimony carefully naturally i must confess that i was predisposed to the credibility of the testimony of these defendants viewed objectively however and based upon my experience in the trial of cases and the application of the tests of credibility which past experience had afforded me i arrived at the reluctant conclusion that the state had established it s case at least to the extent of proving the existence of a widespread conspiracy and plot among the political leaders against the soviet government conclusion without a purge the ussr would have been weak and unable to fight the fascists stalin wasn t a lunatic or a power hungry politician that purged his opponents he protected the ussr from revisionists and traitors sources ww myths and misconceptions stalin was a bad military general and a coward stalin never left his cabinet at the start of the war as many people would like you to believe by saying he was shocked paralised and did nothing stalin stayed put this is seen by the people he had meetings with at the start of the war on the nd of june he had meetings times starting from am molotov npo deputy prev snk beria nkvd tymoshenko npo mehlis nach glavpur ka zhukov ngs ka malenkov sec central committee of the cpsu b mikoyan deputy prev snk kaganovich nkps voroshilov deputy vyshinsky sotr mfa kuznetsov dimitrov comintern manuilsky kuznetsov mikoyan molotov voroshilov beria malenkov voroshilov mikoyan vyshinsky shaposhnikov deputy tymoshenko zhukov vatutin kuznetsov kulik deputy nco beria this is what vasilevsky had to say about stalin in his memoirs in my deep conviction stalin with the second half of world war ii is the most powerful and colorful figure in the strategic command he successfully carried out the organisation of fronts all the military efforts of the country during the battle of moscow stalin stated that he would stay in the city when the wehrmacht was closing in he had a parade organised for the th anniversary of the october revolution after which troops left off to the frontline which were the outskirts of moscow furthermore most vital plans had stalin coordinating them such as the operations to crush the german th army at stalingrad and the german pincer at kursk stalin s name was even assigned to blows to the germans as stalin s ten blows thus we can conclude that stalin never turned his back on the soviet people and did not break as capitalist leaders did the soviets won only because of order order was issued by stalin only after the red army kept retreating deeper and deeper into the east of the country as stalin states the red army left behind million soviets for the germans to torment rape and pillage it was only a countermeasure and was issued towards the commanders and soldiers of the red army furthermore the germans also punished those who deserted their position without an order from the high command of the wehrmacht could we also assume that the germans conquered all their territory out of fear moving on there were only men behind the frontlines they would not be able to stop entire divisions even if they wanted to in reality most troops were told to return to the frontline or arrested and sent to a military tribunal only in rare cases were they shot while many wetsern movies such as enemy at the gates depict mass friendly fire instances which were never recorded lastly order was abolished by stalin on the th of october which shows us that the soviets did not win the only because of the red army lost more troops compared to the axis powers the soviets only won because of numbers they charged machine gun nests cough cough you mean omaha beach in reality the red army lost around million troops while the axis troops combined lost million troops dead captured however of the million soviets died in captivity while only axis died in captivity furthermore if you look at the frontline in the axis troops outnumber the soviets does that also mean the germans were winning initially just because of their supporierty in numbers if not why does the same not apply to the red army the soviet winter defeated the nazi s it may be true that the soviet winter was cold however one cannot state that the soviets were not affected by the cold as much as the germans furthermore it was the soviets that were always in the offensive during the winter primary examples could be seen during the winter of and where the soviets first launched a counter offensive around moscow and then launched operation uranus around stalingrad beating back the nazi s in both cases some may suggest that the winter actually benefited the wehrmacht as roads would solidify for the mechanized units to push further along after the long muddy season thus we can conclude that the winter was not the main reason for nazi defeat as saying so removes credit from the heroic actions of soviet men and women sources numbers order original cabinet journal for the achievements of stalin stalin s greatest achievements economy created a superpower from a backward agricultural country in just years we have a saying stalin accepted russia with a plow and left with an atomic bomb years is a very small amount of time and yet stalin and the soviet people which were powered by the socilalist economy were able to do this for the first time in history this is humanity s greatest achievement from the soviet population increased by around million people ie million up to even though they went through wars from the average humans age increased from to while the death rate fell from to per people which shows the great emphasis on medical care the ussr had full industrialization of the country around small to large scale factories were built under stalin s five year plans this means that there were factories being built per day most of these factories still run up to this day in the national per capita income was dollars by s standards while in it was already dollars by s dollar value in the share of world industrial products was while by it was the ussr had eliminated homelessness and joblessness for the first time in history of mankind the number of scientists in increased times compared to even though the soviets went though the bloodiest war the human race has ever seen the number of scientific institutions in increased by compared with the number of university students in increased by compared with there were over newly created sovkhozes in the country by

35452,here is an old essay i wrote about the ways in which the truth about subjectivity is constructed in an american cosmetic makeover show called the swan the themes i explored within this essay some years ago seem highly relevant given the age of identity politics where people seldom realise their personal choices don t exist outside of existing power structures selfhood is now seen to be in a state of perpetual crisis in the modern west says nick mansfield p this could not be reflected more visibly so than in the fetishism of cosmetic makeover culture amongst women in recent years despite feminist critique using post structurialist psychoanalysis of the media this essay will discuss how the cosmetic makeover show the swan haworth constructs certain subjectivities about women as normal abnormal and self evident rather than revealing the contestants true self or addressing the complex power relations at play to understand this we will primarily focus on foucault s concepts of subjectivity governmentality and power in order to discuss how the contestants are disillusioned by their freedom to choose and in turn voluntarily subject themselves to normalization i will also address how discourse on neo liberalism authenticity and american individualism gained value in the western psyche thus fuelling empowering self help media narratives in american cosmetic makeover culture finally we will look at the role of televisual affect in cosmetic makeover shows and how our emotions are commoditized to appeal to normative processes the swan was an american cosmetic makeover television show in that transformed insecurity ridden women the ugly duckings into beautiful confident swans through a series of extensive procedures fitness regimes and rigorous styling as well as counselling show summary tv com in order to be crowned the ultimate swan the contestant must compete in the finale pageant amongst other women in order to reveal the success of their transformations all of the women who enter the show suffer from a number of body confidence issues and have suffered consequently with relationship issues from bullying to marriage failure this is significant in highlighting the connection between the inner and outer self in light of this we will focus on the case of contestant beth a swan who is unhappy with her appearance particularly after giving birth and has become distant towards her husband which she accounts for his infidelity towards her haworth initial interest in the media as a branch of psychological study came through its constitution as a main factor that could distort or interrupt individual s rational development blackman and walkerdine p however it is important to note this essay engages with post structuralist media psychology which expands on the limits of the media effects model that focused on how the passive or vulnerable persons could be negatively impacted by media rather than viewing psychology as a scientific lens of insight into human behaviour we will view psychology as a form of population management by studying how the media constructs subjectivities as truth and how in a neo liberal society we have some choice in how we are subjected foucault an influential founder of post structuralism claims fiction functions in truth in that the individual is produced by a set of apparatuses of social regulation in which scientific knowledges about what the social and subjective was were fictions which were central in the production of a management which sought to regulate through self regulation walkerdine p post structuralist theory therefore aims to conceptualise the relationship between language social institutions and individual consciousness weeden p as well as this we will engage with psychoanalysis a theory of how the human subject is created by social interaction the french psychoanalysist lacan says the unconscious is the discourse of the other meaning that we are affected by various kinds of power in different ways through our repressed emotions but first it is important for us to look at how the neo liberal idea of the self came about as well as how the term subjectivity derived from psychoanalytic theory relates to this according to nick mansfield p the word subject proposes that the self is not a separate and isolated entity but one that operates at the intersection of general truths and shared principles put in simple terms we are not innately who we think we are as our daily lives from the minute we are born are caught up in complex political social and philosophical that is shared concerns p for example we may have become more empathetic than others because we went through a distressing event in childhood or we may have turned out more self conscious because we grew up in brazil where cosmetic surgery is far more common place michel foucault however describes things a little differently in that subjectivity is the making of human beings as visible subjects a process made up of three elements these three elements consist of the scientific inquiry which produces specific objects or concepts such as the natural or the self dividing practices whereby the subject is either divided in himself or divided from others and subjectification the way a human being turns himself into a subject foucault in this context we will look at how western discourse creates the idea of an other by framing dualism s of mind and body femininity and masculinity as well as high esteem and low esteem foucault claims our subjectivities our governed through our souls p by our most intimate experiences thoughts and feelings this can be seen in the dividing practices at play with beth as she feels cut off from intimacy with her husband has little self esteem after he cheated on her and is scared nobody else will lover her haworth in this way she surrenders herself to change and views the body as a way of liberating herself within during her transformation we see two of foucault s disciplinary technologies take place first beth s emotional confession that she is not happy with her appearance or her esteem and secondly the examination where the surgeons and experts pick out her flawed features and how they can correct them taylor stresses this is key to wielding power as disciplinary power is itself invisible yet renders its subjects hyper visible in order to tighten its grip p in light of this we should view the swan as a form of voluntary self surveillance that foucault calls panopticism adopted from jeremy bentham s model prison the panopticon whereby a state of conscious and permanent visibility is induced that assures the automatic functioning of power foucault p however in governing by will maasen highlights that disciplining is not opposed to autonomy and freedom rather they are embodied if not constituted by those practices that are in turn used to regulate and socialize the individuals choosing to perform them maasen p the swan may usher the contestants into seeing flaws that they weren t even aware of or even the audience for that matter but the women have chosen to become a subject on the show albeit they have been picked specifically because of their vulnerability as subjects for entertainment purposes the post feminist illusion of personal choice and pleasing oneself that is perpetuated through the show also cultivates a worrying hypocrisy in terms of women liberation although the swan frames cosmetic surgery as freedom from the burdens that patriarchy and mother nature brought us instead of being objectified women are interpellated into choosing to be empowered sexual subjects through bodily management and consumption kolehmainen to fit the criteria of the show all the contestants must express through the grammar of individualism a will to become their true selves by undergoing artificial cosmetic surgery to understand this need for self validation we must consider how the authentic self took up its roots within the western psyche and popular culture authenticity can be traced back to ancient greek philosophical injunctions such as to thine own self be true which focused on expressing ones inner feelings and was a paramount concern during the th century when people became worried that others may be concealing their true selves for manipulative purposes harter p typically the false self says harter is experienced as socially implanted against one s will and as such it feels foreign p which in beth s case is deliberately constituted as a personal alienation and not political or cultural which is key in privatising the context of her oppression the popularity of american cosmetic makeover shows like the swan are also heavily underpinned by america s equally happy acceptance of normative social control dana chap p which projects blame onto those who don t fulfil their potential the dialogue of the american dream means new technologies allow for new possibilities to better oneself although possibility and contentment may be sworn enemies powers particularly in light of women s relationship to cosmetic surgery and agency according to foucault discourses at the heart of history and culture about for example what it means to be a man or a woman produce subject positions that leads to normalising processes the process of normalisation in beth s case is achieved through a prescription of breast augmentation tummy tuck facial surgery and a fitness programme as well as therapy to address her marital problems as heye s points out however normalisation is a historical ontological process often concealed by essentializing identity talk even as normalisation homogenises it also paradoxically individualises p this is presented through the contestants desire to become their unique self whilst submitting to normative western white beauty ideals by forging a straight nose perfect teeth youthful fair skin and a chiselled jaw line as well as a toned slim physique it is clear then that the contestant s motivations are self justified by these virtues as being someone who is a good person a construction especially important perhaps to the contemporary american psyche must be represented by a concomitantly attractive body says heyes p contestant beth says the transformation will help her low self esteem as she is framed as a tearful emotionally unstable subject that desires to transform the body she feels oppressed by by seeing herself as abnormal unfeminine and sexually undesirable leading to low self esteem beth places herself as a deficient other in the discourse of beauty sexuality and traditional notions of femininity however dana p warns against using self esteem as a social vaccine as the adoption of self esteem as a social aim allows ourselves to be governed in this light high esteem and self acceptance in women is not constituted as a fixed natural inner entity but rather a performative process in which the deficient woman must enhance themselves to be considered authentic attractive and feminine this confidence is therefore posed as self evident for women who already meet this criteria and engage in these practices and discourses according to judith butler p there is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender identity is performatively constituted by the very expressions that are said to be its results p by reducing the women to what foucault would describe as docile beings to be subjected used transformed and improved pg the contestants value is defined purely on aesthetic potential and more notably for the attention of heterosexual men it is through their sexual desire in beth s case her need to be sexy and wanted that the subjectivity of women and femininity is reinforced this inner versus outer battle is represented in beth s breakdown before the transformation where she sobs describing how her husband kissed another woman rather than reassuring his wife is beautiful her husbands response suggests that as a man he is directly affected by her typically feminine insecurity and simultaneously confused by it this also constructs the truth about men as rational beings who can t help but seek attention from other women if you can t like yourself for you when in fact it is most often tied to pleasing others and conforming in light of this feminist discourse has viewed female subjectivity in cosmetic makeover culture as enacting bodily self hatred as an outcome of patriarchal pressures pitts taylor p by leaving out the gruelling scenes of women s flesh being sliced nipped and tucked to perfection the truth about the vigorous bloody medical procedure behind cosmetic surgery is distorted this is done deliberately so we are not alarmed by the risks involved instead there is a fairy tale narrative in which the contestants fall asleep under anaesthetic and wake up refreshed a little nervous but ultimately relieved shows such as the the swan says heyes exploit fantasy narratives of radical transformation and make clever use of normalizations language of identity pg however we don t get to see the months afterwards in which their tender bruised bodies slowly heal or any issues further down the line despite the risks of these procedures contestant beth claims she has learnt to love herself after the surgery implying that the shows magic wand has worked wonders on her esteem resolved her marriage and allowed her to be her true self again through artificial surgery and bodily mutilation the construction of a neo liberal femininity in the swan as being tied to consumption and being innately self conscious of one s physical appearance is constituted as normal as a problem simply more intrusive to the female subject particularly as a mother this truth about female subjectivity is further strengthened due to beth s stretch marks being a consequence of childbirth something which only women are biologically capable of it also reinforces the idea that women are past their sexual sell by date once they ve had children instead of being seen as inevitable and natural we are prompted to view her stretchmarks as unwanted defects which must be returned to her pre motherhood state in this way the female subject is never satisfied either wanting to return to a previous state or transforming their existing self into something more refined or eccentric to put it simply the state of the woman s body as it ages and goes through changes is not enough it must constantly be scrutinised and improved in order to further ones status and state of wellness however as foucault acclaims power and knowledge directly imply one another and in the case of cosmetic makeover shows like the swan there has been a shift in power the judgment of the male gaze to a narcissistic self scrutiny that knows no end therefore beth s insecurity is not a natural occurrence that arises from existing as a woman rather it has a greater deal more to do with inequality and the power structures that reinforce such social constructions limitations and burdens on the woman as cruikshank points out women s subjectivity is not a natural subjectivity that is hindered or repressed by power it is shaped and constituted by power heyes p women s desire to be attractive is therefore shaped by power structures that judge what is natural and inevitable as unattractive or burdemsome just like in the s when the state funded system of secondary education was introduced in the united kingdom and the working class were taken to be becoming bourgeois walkerdine p by adopting middle class materialistic values and attitudes the ordinary or flawed women on the swan have come to surrender themselves to the superior professionals in this case primarily the surgeons and in a wider context the patriarchy instead of school tests their bodies are critically assessed shifting the focus on the outer flesh rather than the emotional or academic abilities of the individual here the physical appearance is presented as problematic and distressing because of its inevitable state and visibility to blur this superficial focus the show offers counselling so they are seen to be acknowledging the inner wellbeing of the contestant although this only consists of one minute therapy session per week however as walkerdine demonstrates with the working class subject to want to change is to sell out and to not sell out is to remain stupid dormant and anti democratic or in this case sexually undesirable and unsatisfied this reflects the function of the invisible hand coined by adam smith in which capitalist economies work effectively if the markets are free to govern themselves by people working buying and selling out of their own interests in a society that rewards looks the pressure to conform and the promised bounty from doing so such as acceptance and desirability heavily outweighs the more difficult decision to live with ones flaws and face a life of low self esteem and rejection this also marks the change of objectification to subjectification with the over sexualisation of women s bodies central to this as the role of women has expanded beyond domesticity marriage and motherhood brenda weber p also suggests that high budget makeover shows like the swan have helped create a mediated affective economy where miserable subjects trade stories of abjection for the bounty promised through televisual benevolence however i would disagree with her claim that the savvy viewer would translate their tale of woe into mere entertainment value rather the affect of the cosmetic gaze on the unconscious is much deeper than it seems by investing our emotions in the accounts of the women on the show we are invited to subject ourselves by realising our own repressed feelings of inadequacy and in turn sympathise with the condition of the subject beth as a distressed victim held back by her outer flesh in this way we become warmer to the ideal of cosmetic surgery as a rational solution to social ills such as her low self esteem in this way we function through what foucault calls self technologies forms of therapies and self management which permit individuals to undergo a certain number of operations on their own bodies and souls in order to attain happiness maasen on the contrary pitts taylor says criticism of female subjects in cosmetic surgery as self hating and mentally unwell in psychiatric and feminist discourse leads to what foucault called a hermeneutics of the self in that they are productive and inscriptive rather than truly understanding the subject p this can be seen as an ignorance towards the emotional burden on those who may feel heavily burdened by their looks in an extremely judgmental society kathy davis even implies that women s decisions to get cosmetic surgery were rational given the extensive social pressures women faced pitts taylor p however feminists would be right in thinking this would be an extreme rationalization in that the scrutiny of such responses can be viewed as a body positive resistance to women futhering their subordination whilst on one side women may use their sexual power from cosmetic surgery to gain attention or a sense of security in a relationship they also render themselves vulnerable to straying further away from themselves through constant aesthetic updates in a competitive frantic world since we cannot escape the self and we are all bound to continue ageing and changing the show s normalization of cosmetic surgery can be seen as peddling a perpetual state of denial of ones true self by desperately trying to undo what cannot be truly be prevented essentially they continue to chase the carrot dangled before their head in conclusion the swan constitutes the truth about the cosmetic female subject as an empowered work in progress and strengthens its grip through the audience s unconsciousness with neo liberal identity talk we can all relate and aspire to despite the shows emphasis on becoming one s authentic self the women on the show have internalized their bodily objectification by self governing themselves and submitting to normative processes using foucault s terminology i have proved how subjectivities are governed and regulated in a number of ways how american individualism contributes to an endless possibility of self regulation and transformation peddled by the media as well as how as women our choices can never truly exist outside power structures because they are embodied in our making of the self bibliography video and websites title summary of the swan tv com url title swan beth after liposuction boob job nose job brow lift eye

her father she could hear the constant thud of a ball outside the drive her brothers were playing basketball outside in the driveway she glanced at the clock then put down the t shirt she had been folding it was time to get them in for dinner daddy would be home soon and she wanted everything to be ready before he arrived since their mother had ran off melody had taken over the duties of being the cook housekeeper and babysitter melody looked out the backdoor at her brothers it was hard to believe how big they are now zack was and the spitting image of daddy chiselled and rugged peter was a year older and a junior at college they were both very active outgoing types melody flushed with shame when she caught herself admiring her brother s hard muscled bodies they both lived at home daddy wanted it that way he wanted his kids close by him at all times guys food is ready soon she called out come get cleaned up the boys shouted in unison and got ready to come in but not before zack eyed the basketball hoop and thrown his shot the ball hurdled through the air past peter and straight into the basket oh yeah he shouted pumping his fist the boys were generally obedient and well behaved but they also had an air of mischief about them as zack walked in he slapped melody on the ass making her yelp he ran into the kitchen before she could grab him melody ran after him catching up to him at the refrigerator she reached up and ruffled his curly blond hair he grinned at her and leaned down to kiss her cheek peter snuck up behind her and kissed her other cheek melody s face flushed the boys were very affectionate but she found it hard to process her feelings her blushing face was too irresistible for the boys so they both kissed her again god they d be there all day if she didn t do anything about it she shooed them away to go wash their hands daddy will be home soon go get yourselves decent for the supper table both of her brothers nodded and went off to clean up melody hummed to herself softly filling dishes with the evening s meal she was quite proud of her cooking she prided herself with the fact that she taught herself how to keep three grown men fed with whatever she had on hand the aroma of fresh baked bread and pot roast filled the kitchen a pair of strong powerful arms wrapped around melody s tummy as she put down the bread rolls smells wonderful honey daddy had walked into the kitchen and quietly stole up behind his beautiful daughter she turned and kissed his bearded face to welcome him home his lips lightly brushed hers sending an illicit shock of excitement trailing through her he wrapped an arm around her waist how was your day melody put a plate in front of her father as he took his place at the table good everything has gone so well today i got all the housework done he looked around and smiled approvingly at the sparkling clean home you work so hard to make such a nice home for us all i am very proud of you and i haven t forgotten your

daddy in the world the boys joined them at the table happy th birthday melody the boys shouted melody giggled at her brothers daddy has a surprise for me she knew she should be more mature about it but she found it hard to contain her excitement wondering what it could be we know we know what it is too zack winked and stuck his tongue out at her just like when he was a little boy she giggled again she couldn t wait daddy noticed how she wiggled in her chair he watched her twisting back and forth as she ate her dinner sit still child your surprise is coming right after we finish eating after they had all finished eating melody got up to do dishes but the boys took her by the hand and led her into the living room not tonight mel peter said she smiled at them daddy was in his chair waiting for them well melody you re all grown up now i can hardly believe you are my little girl when i look at you you have blossomed into a beautiful woman i want you to know i am proud of you melody blushed at her father s words i guess you want your surprise now melody nodded yes please she wondered if it was a tablet or an ipod they weren t poor but they weren t the type to spend daddy s hard earned money frivolously either daddy looked at his two boys who sat on the floor beside melody s chair he nodded at peter then at zack zack smiled back at him the boys exchanged and glance and then looked up at melody mischief again danced in their eyes what were they up to daddy crossed his legs and leaned back in his chair he pulled out his pipe and lit it he looked again at the boys he drew a deep breath and then nodded to them before melody knew what was happening the boys were grabbed her each had a leg in their hands and they pulled her to the floor guys melody yelped in surprise zack scrambled up to the wide eyed melody and then covered her mouth with his his tongue plunged deep into her mouth probing and tasting peter was holding her down to the floor her brain fired up a rational side of it told her to push zack away to ignore the sudden rush of arousal flooding her pussy she told herself she wanted to protest but couldn t her words were muffled by zack s tongue he was so forceful and forward his tongue probed and tasted her she couldn t help but moan as she tasted his sweet saliva she tried to pry herself free but she felt like she was trapped under a concrete slab she was totally helpless in their grasp eventually zack pulled away from her taking with him a long band of saliva he flashed her a wicked smile he and peter then hitched her dress up revealing her white panties she looked over at daddy who simply watched just enjoy it sweetheart he murmured trust daddy all women are sluts deep down look at your mother you all want cock i m giving you what you want but at least this way you won t leave like she did she went out to chase cock we re going to show you that you have all the cock you need here did daddy know all this time living under the roof as her brothers had taken it s toll on her melody knew she shouldn t have indulged her needs but she masturbated quite often at night almost every fantasy was either with daddy or one of her handsome brothers daddy continued to watch the boys as they hooked their fingers under the band of melody s panties she groaned her heart pounding against her ribcage as she watched her panties slide over her thighs and down her ankles the fabric soaked with her juices she could see the angry bulges between her brothers shorts they were turned on she didn t protest any longer daddy had said to lay still and she did just that she wanted to be a good girl and good girls always obeyed their daddies he was always right zack put his finger on her inflamed pussy lips running it up and down her slit and getting it all slick and wet in the process she felt a trial of pleasure from where his finger touched her she looked straight up at the ceiling not sure of what to do she thrusted her hips out against him peter leaned over her body and began unbuttoning her dress he unhooked the front hook of her bra and her breasts fell out grateful to be released from it s confines god sis you re so beautiful he said as he admired melody s heavy mounds t thank you his hands kneaded her tits making her moan in pleasure he arched over and took one juicy gumdrop sized nipple into his mouth she gritted her teeth as she felt his hot tongue lash against her teat sending pulses of pleasure through her body his other hand reached for her other breast and he tugged her nipple playfully she heard herself moan fuck it felt good it shouldn t feel good she felt zack s fingers slide into her pussy she felt his fingers explore the hot inner walls of her unclaimed pussy and she moaned again peter bit her nipple and pinched harder melody moaned louder zack then withdrawn his invading fingers leaned over her and shoved his face into her sopping wet cunt he darted his tongue out using the fat area of it to lap up her juices so fucking sweet he growled is there anything better than tasting your own sister s pussy then he darted his tongue in and out of her fucking her with it oh god melody cried out wrapping her fingers around his beautiful golden curls and pulling his mouth tight against her aching lips her heart banged hard against her ribcage as she watched her little brother s head bob up and down as he shamelessly ate her out peter suddenly pulled back from her breasts and yanked his shorts down his cock sprung out as the band of his shorts went over it melody gasped at the sight of her brother s erection the head was an angry purple and it was thick and long she licked her lips his eyes glazed over with lust he wrapped his finger around this girth and pushed it up against her face rubbing it up against her cheek and leaving a trail of precum against her skin oh god the smell it was a thick and musky scent it was the kind of smell you don t get anywhere else and it went straight into her brain and made her pussy tingle with shameful excitement melody spun her face away from it but peter grabbed her face with his vice grip fingers and turned her back toward the waiting cock he rubbed the crown of his angry cock against her lips which she kept tight together his cock felt hot against her and she could almost taste the salty sweetness of his excitement he tried to forced it into her mouth but she resisted with what s left of her rapidly evaporating mind oh god forgive me i need to taste peter s cock she relaxed her mouth and peter eased his cock into her mouth she tasted his cock and groaned against the taste of her brother s precum dancing on her tongue then she started to suck instinctively that s a good girl daddy said melody s tummy bloomed with pride she liked being complimented for being such a good cocksucker zack now watched peter and his sister he wanted some of that action too impatient he stood and turned it to his dick to melody s head too melody couldn t help but giggle to herself zack was a needy thing he hated missing out especially when peter was involved she relented taking peter s cock off and eased zack inside her mouth she couldn t believe that she was on her knees and giving both her brothers oral sex oh fuck he growled his hands grabbed the sides of melody s head and he started fucking her mouth with abandon melody s eyes went wide she can t believe this is really happening one moment they were having a happy family dinner and the next her little brother was face fucking her what made it worse was that it excited her she enjoyed her mouth being treated like a fucktoy she loved the tight desperate expression zack made as he was overwhelmed with pleasure peter jerked off as he watched melody turned her head toward peter and put her hand up for him zack fucked her mouth while she pumped peter s cock daddy watched his children at play good good fuck her mouth boys get ready to cum i want to see that semen shoot out all over her tits i want to see her covered in cum mark her as your territory she belongs to no one else but us melody didn t know why but she felt even more excited knowing daddy was watching she moaned and sucked massaging the other cock with her hand shit i m going to cum zack cried out me too peter said both boys pulled out at the same time aiming their rock hard cocks at her tits hot ropes of cum blasted out of their cocks landing on her tits and her belly she moaned as the burning hot fluid covered her zack and peter emptied out their load on her jerking and squeezing until the last drops came out of their cock slits and ripped onto their waiting sister then the three of them collapsed on the floor the boys were spent and exhausted gasping for breath and melody was panting her head was going blank as the thick smell of cum invaded her nostrils daddy leered at the body of his lovely daughter he smiled at the glistening cum on her tits he looked over at his boys and gave them another instruction strip her i want to see that cute ass of hers the boys willingly obeyed melody lay there as they ripped her clothes from her she groaned as she felt the fabric of her dress tear the sound of the seams splitting as her brothers tore it off her it s alright babygirl daddy will buy you a new dress hell i ll buy you an entire wardrobe they rolled her over onto her tummy exposing the soft ass to daddy melody felt the cold wooden floorboards grind the dried cum against her skin time for a birthday spanking boys zack and peter took turns spanking their sister s ass they counted off nineteen slaps and then each slapped an ass cheek as they counted one to grow on she wiggled under their spanking shuddering at first against the sharp explosion of biting pain as hand whipped against her cheeks but then she felt a strange sense of comfort as their hands would soothe the cheeks more she heard herself say zack and peter looked up at daddy who simply nodded they spanked and spanked melody as she begged for more daddy looked with glee as melody s ass began to glow red he kneeled down between her legs and watched the hands spanking and the flesh of her cheeks wiggle each slap took her breath away she groan and gasped as she gritted her teeth against the sharp explosion of pain on her buttocks but with each spank she felt something fade away inside her an exhilaration of sorts she groaned as she felt her brother s hands weakening from exertion then they rubbed her tender buttocks lovingly melody wanted to see the color of her butt admire the handiwork that s enough boys move over to the couch now daddy has some things he wants to do too peter and zack sat on the couch massaging their aching hands and watched as daddy pulled out his stiff cock it was huge it was longer than her forearm and as thick as a can of soda her eyes went wide as she followed the angry veins running down his shaft she swallowed zack and peter were well endowed but nothing to compared to the cock daddy produced daddy dangled the cock above her ass touching the tip on her sensitive cheeks he stuck his fingers up her pussy feeling them get instantly coated in wetness ahhh she moaned as he began to fuck her virgin cunt with his fingers hold on baby i m going to bury my cock in your tight pussy he laid on top of her and grabbed her hips holding her securely to him he tilted her hips a bit and rubbed his cock against her lips to get it wet a low lust filled growl escaped his lips as he savoured the feeling of his cock rubbed up against his daughter s aching slit daddy she moaned you ready for this baby melody simply nodded he hucked his hips finding the right angle satisfied he eased the the crown of his cock slowly into melody s lips oh god melody groaned as she felt the monster cockhead spread her lips daddy reached around and put his hand over her mouth he eased another inch into her and another as she moaned and he felt her mouth bite down against his hand fucking hell every inch of her was filled and expanded from daddy s invading cock it hurt a little at first from the tightness but then she felt wetness flood within her the slutty side of her needed this eager for daddy to start fucking her he held her mouth tightly shut but her cries of pleasure can be heard by her brothers peter called to daddy fuck her hard make her cum dad they cheered daddy smiled as his entire cock was completely buried inside her all the way to the base he felt his heavy balls rest against her ass i m going to start moving now melody nodded her eyes glazed over with need he eased himself out of her a little then he pushed it back in ugh she cried out then he eased his cock out even further and then plunged it all the way back in melody cried out each time he did so and she tightened her legs around daddy s hips he growled in pleasure as his cock was coated in his daughter s slick juices her cunt was getting used to his monster sized cock now so he started fucking her harder and harder driving her into the floor her face was beaded with sweat and her tits bounced against his thrusts he pulled his hand away from her mouth and squeezed her tits god he was fucking his daughter like whore he wanted her to feel what real cock could do to her her body shook and trembled as he fucked her he felt his cock throb and knew he was ready to cum d daddy you gonna cum baby yes daddy cum baby cum on my cock like a good girl he pistons his legs more fucking her even harder then his daughter reached up and hugged him locking them in an intimate embrace her hand brushed his bearded face and she reached up and took him into her mouth she groaned as she tasted her father s kiss and cigarettes somehow it tasted good because it tasted of him she groaned into his mouth as her tongue found his then she felt herself fall over the edge her eyes rolled up and she cried out as she exploded her body shuddered as her climax hit her like a tsunami daddy held her as wave after wave of pleasure washed over her i m going to cum inside you baby melody s eyes went wide do it daddy fill me with your cum daddy increased his tempo and groaned as her cunt tightened around him even more he growled and pushed her back down on the floor and forced his cock in and out of her melody moaned as she felt how full her pussy was with her dad s cock she shuddered in anticipation as she waited for his thick hot cum fill her up she didn t know why but she needed to feel it inside her her daddy was a big strong mountain of a man and now he s completely focused on fucking her he was feeling good and it was all because of her fuck he growled melody locked her legs around him and dug her heel into his back he growled and leaned forward sinking his teeth into her neck as he exploded she came again she felt her father s cock swell and then molten hot seed shot out right into the very depths of her pussy she felt her cervix contract and drawing in as much as his cum deep into her fertile womb daddy he kissed her again as he shuddered hard against her emptying the remaining ropes of cum inside her spent she collapsed back down against the floor she moaned as daddy pulled out her gaping hole feeling empty as he did so then he shimmied up his cock close to her face she understood she opened her mouth and sucked on his cock cleaning his cum and her juices of it her pussy throbbed with perverse excitement as she realized how naughty the act was clean it up baby that s a good girl melody licked and cleaned the best she could there was so much she his cum her juices and saliva dripped down her chin and onto her cum soaked tits god she smelled like sex daddy then looked over at his boys who were rubbing their hard cocks as they watched the fucking want more he asked his sons both nodded eager to fuck their sister daddy nodded at them and they rushed off the couch and to melody s naked body zack got to her first and he led on the floor and pulled melody on top of him after the hard fucking she took from daddy her pussy slid easily on zack s cock it wasn t as big as daddy but she can t help moaning it still felt amazing especially how wrong it was to have her little brother s cock inside her zack s face was a mask of pure bliss fuck i wanted your pussy for so long he said i always jerk off thinking about you mel she couldn t help but smile at that i m taking this peter said and then grabbed a jar of coconut oil what is he doing she wondered she liked to use the coconut oil to give daddy massages when he finished a hard days work he used his forefinger and fished out a glob of oil pushed her forward over zack and then he used his fingers to push it into her asshole fuck she cried out and gritting her teeth as she felt his digit invade her tight puckered asshole it felt tight but it didn t hurt peter didn t just force it in and the oil helped lube his finger up considerably then it started feeling good really fucking good she never realized how good it felt to be filled in both holes at the same time melody moaned closing her eyes and just focusing on the sensations her brothers were inflicting on her she felt peter s finger slide deeper into her until she felt his knuckle rest against the base of her ass so fucking tight he growled can t wait can t wait for what she yelped as he pulled his finger all the way out then he climbed around and behind her then she knew peter wrapped his hand around his cock and guided it towards her little rosebud oh god she cried out as she felt his crown enter her it was so much bigger than his finger he dug his fingers into her hips and slowly pushed himself into her the tightness turned into pleasure as she got used to the feeling woah i can feel you bro zack said as both their cocks were inside their sister she s really tight peter growled then they started moving both cocks went in and out of melody s aching orifices one pushed as the other pulled she felt so full so fucking amazing that she didn t know what to focus on she felt like her brothers personal whore it was so nasty and filthy and wrong and she loved it boys fuck me more i need it she begged they fucked her while daddy watched happy that his children were getting along so well i m gonna cum zack cried out it was too much for him cum boys fill me up with your cum melody moaned they obliged she felt their cocks tighten and suddenly she was filled with more hot thick cum she loved how it felt loved how they cried in blissful ecstasy and she loved how daddy was watching them so intently all three of them were locked together and they didn t move until their legs regained their strength zack and peter eased themselves out of their sister slowly and she collapsed onto the floor thick globs of cum dripped out of her cunt and asshole trailing down her legs and onto the wooden floor the boys stood and grabbed some tissue to wipe themselves eventually melody regained enough strength to prop herself up she felt sore but fulfilled this was the best present ever she said smiling to her father thanks for reading and if you enjoyed it please consider

38407,hi the name s charlotte my friends and family called me lottie as far as regular nineteen year olds go i was pretty regular except for one tiny little thing i was into incest porn no i didn t intend to fuck anyone in my family that s wrong i liked the taboo nature of incest okay something about doing it with someone in your family how it s so wrong flipped switches inside me my hobby was to have a really good time with mr bunny my trusty vibrator and some hot incest vids i found off the internet i lived with mom and dad so most of the time i had to do it on the down low no moaning mr bunny turned down to the lowest setting under the sheets so no one would hear and it s either mute or headphones in when i m watching daddy fucking his daughter yeah that was my jam i didn t mind a bit of brother sister porn but the thought of being bred by my own daddy always got me off so it was a wednesday afternoon college classes were over mom was out somewhere at the spa with her friends or shopping as usual dad and my bro were working still so i had a good few hours alone in the house that meant a few hours of uninterrupted privacy to play i had to admit i was excited the rest of the week waiting until today made me feel hornier than a nun at a stripclub the driveway being empty was a sure sign that no one was home i stuck my head into my brother s bedroom to make sure he wasn t in and then tossed my schoolbag on the floor my body thrummed with urgency but i like to take my time it was like marinating a steak i would strip my day s clothes off and change into something a bit more comfortable that meant a vest top and some panties if anyone came home i could always kick the door shut and pull on some pajama bottoms those were on the floor ready yeah i really thought his through fuck i licked my lips school was busy as hell lately and i had assignments coming out of my ears i could feel it already when i get my much needed orgasm i just know it d wash away the stress too i waited all day for this last night in some obscure pro incest forum i downloaded a really hot video daddy daughter too so i knew it was going to be great i led on my bed and rubbed my thighs together all that was left was to get mr bunny but not right away i d be too tempted to use him immediately and spoil the fun i was going to make sure i watched most of the video before i start playing so phone in my hand i scrolled for the video and pressed play a girl about my age college level maybe was sitting on a sofa looking bored and watching tv the scene looked like it was shot through a video camera the screen closed in on her she turned looks and smiles at me hey daddy the guy behind the camera didn t say anything just unzips his pants and pulls his flaccid dick out you want me to help you with that daddy she said looking up at the camera you know i do the male voice crackled through the screen he grabs the back of her head and she took his cock in her mouth he was rough demanding he was using his daughter s mouth for his own pleasure why did i like that the girl s face was tight but i knew she was enjoying it being treated like a fuck toy by daddy the quality of the video was amateurish but in my opinion that only adds to the authenticity just call me a connoisseur the sound of her cock sucking was squelchy and tinny through my phone s speakers god that was so hot i wish dad would do that to me just grab my face and shove his cock in my mouth what a girl can have fantasies a hand drifted upwards and pinched and tugged at my nipples through the fabric of my top my thighs grounded together and i could feel wetness blooming between my legs shit i don t think i can last through the entire video without touching myself i felt a different fullness between my legs ah crap i needed to pee i tossed the phone onto the bed and went to the bathroom i ll rewind it back to the part i left off when i come back i really needed that a bad habit of mine was to forget to do things when i m rushed i skipped breakfast and lunch and evidently i didn t bother with bathroom breaks either no harm no foul i m also a little ocd or adhd or whatever you call it sometimes things just grab my attention so i probably wasted a good ten minutes squeezing blackheads out of my face when i passed the bathroom mirror at least i can focus on the sexy task at hand now i didn t expect to run into my father when i walked into my bedroom he was by my bed with my phone in his hand oh fuck he was watching the video the girl moaned and begged as she was being fucked by her dad at least that was what i pictured based on the erotic noises you like daddy s cock slut lottie what is this dad asked oh hey dad it s not what you think i said yes daddy fuck your slutty daughter okay so it was what he thought my heart slammed around in my chest my stomach was in knots god somebody kill me already dad turned his eye from the phone and looked me up and down he took his time too was he looking at me in a different way then he smirked and tossed the phone to me don t let your mother catch you with that stuff so you re cool with that yeah no probs i find that kind of thing hot too must run in the family he chuckled cool i said not really knowing how to respond uh why are you home so early accident at work one of the lads drilled through a water pipe so there s nothing to be done until the higher ups straighten it out everyone was told to take the day off right i ll leave you to it i guess you have fun when you re all alone in the house yeah i admitted sorry dad is that wrong hell no i m just glad someone has the time to do it i have no time or the chance to do it otherwise i d be doing the same thing myself he laughed sorry over sharing no dad it s cool really i don t mind sharing and talking about stuff like this i always felt it was weird to be into this sort of thing and now i know you re into it too you are into it aren t you into what i felt my face flush you know incest he smirked and then i knew dad was just messing with me you jerk i said giving him a friendly thump we laughed at that and what s left of the tension in the room dissipated okay hon i ll excuse myself there s still time before josh and your mother are home have a good one god i can t believe i was going to say it it was pure madness but something inside me made me do it dad you said you didn t have time to uhh sort yourself out you think you d want to do it like right now lottie are you suggesting that i should jerk off with you or something i licked my lips well we do have the place to ourselves i don t mind if it s not weird or anything dad flashed me that warm smile that always seemed to melt me well something else was melting and i never really felt this way before okay i might have the occasional incest fantasy about my dad but i didn t expect it to actually happen not that it was going to happen this might be i dunno kinda exciting if he s cool with it i mean we re both adults what s the harm i think i d like that very much i didn t waste any time jumping onto the bed before i chickened out i got comfortable and dad joined me it was a double bed so there was plenty of room so what are you watching uhh a daddy daughter scene you like that sort of thing the butterflies fluttered manically in my gut yeah i think that s hot me too i pressed play and we watched in silence jesus the father was really driving it into the daughter at some point he placed the camera on the side or something and we had a shot of him fucking his daughter hard all we could hear was her moaning helplessly i tried not to groan under my breath as i heard the sound of his cock driving in and out of her dad was beside me equally stunned i never knew how musky and masculine his scent was he was working all morning so he had a tinge of sweat which went right to my head i glanced to the side and his chest was raising and falling his hand was between his legs holy fuck was he trying to hide his boner now or never i was holding the phone up so we both could watch the scene with my other hand i buried it between my legs shit i was fucking soaked i felt dad s eyes watching my fingers move over my pussy under my panties but he didn t say anything i didn t think he knew where to watch either the phone or my hand it felt too good and dad watching me masturbate only added to my excitement you going to sort yourself out too i asked oh yeah it was kinda cute to see dad being so bashful i sucked in a breath as he moved his hand away from his pants his cock tented against the seam dad struggled for a bit with the zipper and i almost moaned out when he managed to fish his dick out he was huge you sure you don t mind me doing this no daddy i don t mind at all fucking hell just do it already i want to see you jerk that monster he cleared his throat and wrapped his fingers around his shaft dad had big strong builder s hands and even he barely wrapped it around his shaft i tried not to stare but i was mesmerized dad was trying to hold in his moans as he pumped his cock the way his fingers went up then down in a slow steady rhythm was hypnotic then precum leaked out at the tip daddy oh shit sorry honey i tend to leak when i m really turned on you enjoying the video that s one part of it he grunted fuck we didn t say much more after that my clit ached painfully and each time i circled it with my finger my hips would buck involuntarily even with mr bunny i never felt this good the panties pushing against my fingers felt restrictive so i pulled them aside for easier play fuck dad growled what is it just that you have a really pretty pussy lottie thanks i said my heart raced as i watched dad pumping away he wasn t trying to rush it but i sensed his pressure building or was it mine he couldn t keep his eyes off my pussy and i loved how that made me feel daddy would you like a hand you you want to touch me i thought maybe it d be more fun if we helped each other out just an idea he swallowed i d love that honey only if you re sure i smiled and reached over daddy hissed as i gripped his cock it was burning hot and pulsed in my hand i licked my lips and pumped him a weird thrum of excitement coursed through me as my pussy soaked fingers were touched him my own nectar was being rubbed into dad s cock fuck baby he groaned feels so fucking good every time i dragged my hand up to his tip his cock would twitch i kept doing it over and over and more precum leaked out and dripped over my fingers i wondered what it d taste like daddy do you think you can help me out too sure baby his meaty hand reached over and danced over my trimmed pussy he spent a few moments running his fingertips through it sorry i know guys prefer it shaved i said feeling like i disappointed him somehow oh no honey not at all i like a little bit of hair makes you look so womanly and sexy i tried to focus on his cock in my hand and not his on me but it was hard fuck i cried out as his fingers found my clit daddy s hands were rough and calloused but felt so fucking good on my sensitive clit that seemed to encourage him and he teased me a little lightning bolts of pleasure coursed through my body i dropped the phone but neither of us seemed to care all i could hear was the sound of moans on the floor beside the bed then a tip of daddy s finger found the entrance of my pussy my hand clasped over his wrist gripping him tight daddy i begged so hot baby girl you re so fucking hot his digit disappeared inside me fuck i cried out daddy s thick finger delved into me parting my folds and explored the tight wet inner walls of my pussy his hand felt so strong and relentless as his finger sank so deep into me his knuckles rested against my entrance such a bad girl getting so turned on like this dad pumped his finger in and out making my pussy make lewd nasty sounds my other hand let go of his cock instead twisting into his shirt tearing fabric as i held on for dear life as i rode against him daddy s finger felt better than any cock i ve had up till now daddy i sobbed stop please i m going to i m going to cum baby cum for me i want to feel it i gasped sucking in air i felt myself fall over the edge i m cumming i cried out my entire body spasmed against dad as the most intense orgasm of my life exploded inside me he kept pushing his finger in and out but in a steadier slower rhythm hot tears streaked down my face as i sobbed overwhelmed by white hot pleasure spent i sank back into my bed just laying there drunk from my post orgasmic glow my dad just made me cum and i loved it dad leaned over and kissed me on the forehead thank you daddy i said he simply smiled glad to help dad turned to give me a side cuddle and i felt his rock hard cock jab into my leg oh god sorry dad i forgot don t worry about it i grabbed his cock daddy hissed his cock pulsed with need it was slimy with precum i want to daddy it s not fair for you to make me feel so good and miss out yourself daddy lied back onto the bed making himself comfortable my tongue ran over my dry lips as i watched his cock throb in my hand as i stroked up and down his shaft i never touched one this big before all the boys i messed around with were disappointly small don t get me wrong i have no problems with a small dick but knowing that my daddy had such a big one well it made my pussy ache all over again my hand traced along the thick curve of his shaft every time i reached the tip i gave it a slight twist drawing out a low guttural groan out of him i loved that sound more precum leaked out and dad covered his eyes with his forearm he gritted his teeth looking like he was in pain i m not hurting you am i oh god no baby girl it feels too good i kept watching his dick pumping it in at a slow lazy pace the thick musky scent of his arousal went straight up my nose it pulsed and twitched in my hand i swallowed it looked so tasty dad s eyes were still covered i m sorry daddy i can t resist thick salty sweet precum slathered all over my tongue as i enveloped my mouth over his cock mmph i groaned relishing in the taste oh god lottie oh fuck what are you doing my tongue swirled around his cock head and was rewarded with more precum oh fuck he growled twisting his fingers into my hair fuck don t stop my hand joined in with my mouth pumping his shaft furiously as i sucked i hoped i wasn t too bad at it but the way daddy kept thrusting his hip driving his cock into my mouth made me think he was enjoying it enough i m going to cum baby daddy warned cum daddy feed me your cum i gasped before taking it back in his cock was more urgent stabbing at the back of my mouth almost making me gag the bed creaked as he rocked his hips overwhelmed with the need to cum fuck he cried out my eyes went wide as daddy s cock swelled up in my mouth then a hot thick load of cum hit the back of my throat i swallowed wishing i could savor the taste but another shot hit me then another flooding my mouth i mewled and tried my best to swallow it down but there was too much semen leaked out of my mouth running down my face and neck some dripped all over daddy s cock but he was too busy ejaculating to care his whole body constricted one last time easing out one last load into my mouth before he collapsed back on the bed oh god he gasped fucking hell did you like that daddy that was amazing i smiled and cuddled up to him he held me in his arms and we laid there not saying anything and waiting for our breaths to settle i stroked his arm while he caressed my flat tummy daddy looked at me his eyes filled with warmth and lust then he leaned over and pushed his lips over mine i kissed him back and then he returned the kiss it was kinda sweet really just cuddling and kissing with daddy his lips ran traced over mine and then he delved the tip of his tongue into my mouth daddy no i gasped my mouth is covered in your cum i don t care he growled and he rolled on top of me my eyes went wide as he pried my mouth open exploring me tasting me god daddy was so intense we french kissed as i felt the weight of daddy s body on top of mine he pulled up my vest exposing my tits s sorry they re not that big i said my face flushed they re beautiful he moved down and took a nipple in his mouth sucking and teasing it o oh god i moaned my fingers curled into the bedsheets as i let my dad play with my breasts my pussy was getting soaked again and then i felt his cock rubbing up against me d daddy his face was tight with need i m so sorry lottie we shouldn t cross the line but i can t help myself can i have a taste just a little i thrusted my hips in response my lips kissing the underside of his shaft he groaned took his cock in his hand and ran it against my inflamed pussy his dick was getting slick with my juices as he ran it up and down from base to tip i bit down on my lip it felt so good my heart pounded against my ribcage knowing that daddy s precum were leaking out again marking me with it knowing how perilously close we were to crossing the line daddy i begged a primitive growl escaped his lips his legs splayed mine open more exposing my teen pussy to him i m so sorry baby he pushed feeding an inch of his cock into my tight entrance every nerve in my pussy fired up making me moan fuck daddy s eyes were glazed over i could tell he was mad with lust there was no way he was going to stop now not that i wanted him to i pushed my legs open more give it to me i want all of you inside me god i was so wet i could feel my juices leaking out coating daddy s rock hard cock with it he obliged pushing his hips forward and impaling me with his cock d daddy i cried out i was so full so fucking full the inner walls of my pussy stretched around his invading cock you okay my hand caressed his thick solid chest it s a little tight but i m okay keep going please he nodded and slowly fed more into me we were like that at a time i was half gasping letting my body get used to his thickness and he was giving it to me but trying not to give in the urge to just shove it all the way inside me it was kinda hot my mind was a haze of pure bliss the more daddy filled me with his cock the foggier my mind went eventually i felt the base of his cock rest against my entrance it s all in sweetness i m all the way inside you my hands reached over and his abs pressed against my palm oh god i m going to start moving now okay i licked my lips and nodded daddy did it slowly at first still worried he was going to hurt me it was tight but the more his cock pulled out and disappeared back into me the easier it felt he liked to tease me his cock would draw back slowly raking every inch of my pussy until his tip was at the entrance and then he shoved it all the way in d daddy i groaned you re so tight lottie so fucking tight the bed creaked as daddy slammed into me with abandon i couldn t stifle my cries of pleasure anymore someone could come home and i d be too much in pleasure to care i wanted to be fucked by daddy this was a dream come true nothing would ruin it for me daddy was enjoying it too i could tell his face was tight with pleasure and i knew he was holding back i ll pull out soon i promise you just feel too good my legs hooked over his back and i drove my heels into his ass no don t i purred cum inside me daddy oh god what was i doing it was like someone else has taken over me entirely a switched flipped down inside me and all i could think about was how good it d feel to be filled up with cum daddy s cum i wasn t even on the pill he d surely impregnate me if he did my hands hooked over his neck pulling him close to me i kissed him and moaned his tongue found mine and he devoured it like a starved man cum in me i whispered into his ear cum inside your daughter s fertile pussy daddy growled his nails dug into my hips sending a sharp pain through me but it felt good like he was claiming me as his his hips moved harder and faster driving his cock as deep as he could inside me desperately trying to reach the entrance to my womb i giggled daddy turned completely feral his teeth were finding my flesh to rake against he sucked on a breast biting and tugging at a nipple or biting the fleshy globe of my breast bruising and marking me his tongue licked up the sweat that i made until he found my neck then he sank his fangs into me ugh i cried out daddy was making me mine his hands found my wrists and he held me down not letting me escape i m going to cum he warned cum daddy i sobbed please give it to me daddy roared his entire body tightened up on me his cock swelled inside me stretching me more i sobbed as another orgasm enveloped me triggered by daddy s molten hot cum blasting into my pussy i tightened my thighs around him driving my feet as hard as i can into his ass pulling him as close to me as possible i knew my womb was sucking his cum up drawing it deep into me daddy s cock kept pulsing each twinge sent a fresh bolt of pleasure reverberating through my sensitive body eventually he stopped cumming and his climax ebbed away then he collapsed on me i stroked the back of his head soothing him as he sucked in air i chuckled to myself as my hips started to feel sore i haven t had a work out like that in a while i need a smoke dad said you smoke i used to but i quit after you guys came along but i remember how nice it was after having sex that good don t tell your mother there s a lot i can t tell her i laughed dad felt a little better and he slowly eased his cock out of me i groaned as my cunt suddenly felt empty without his cock inside me his cum leaked out of me seeping into the bedsheets i m going to have to clean that before everyone comes home i said we both laughed it was getting late and dad put his clothes back on while i pulled on some pajama bottoms you don t regret this do you dad asked huh no not at

38736,seducing our teens chapter dirty incest roleplay i was eager to get home eager but i didn t until i finished up with the paperwork it was a friday evening and like many other fridays i stayed back to tie up any loose ends in my company i work as a paper pusher for a paper manufacturing business not glamourous i know but it pays for the mortgage and funds my kid s education i raised my arms as high as i could and tried to pull the knot out of my lower back my eyes went back down to the desk and settled on the photo of my family which i look at often my son owen was nineteen and was studying computer science in university and my daughter paige was studying to be a graphics designer i couldn t help but smile as i thought of them paige in particular don t get me wrong i m proud of my son he was a little withdrawn which concerned me as a father at least i wouldn t have to worry about him going out drinking and catching all sorts of diseases from unscrupulous women god forbid he gets anyone pregnant he s got a good head on his shoulders so i know he ll do just fine with his studies way i see it an old fossil like me who hasn t quite grasped the digital age he s not going to have trouble finding a decent job after he graduates that was going to be awhile yet so in the meantime i can keep an eye on him at home my baby girl was a whole different kettle of fish altogether eighteen beautiful and a right little social butterfly she was just as intelligent as her brother but much more outgoing a slither of guilt panged through me as i let my thoughts linger a bit too long over paige she was definitely a woman now complete with gracious curves and her face carried an elfin grace i supposed i should be grateful that she wasn t openly dating anyone i wouldn t know how to deal with that finally there s my wife the mother of my children claire christ how the hell did i land a beauty like her we re married twenty years today and i never felt more blessed sure we had our ups and downs like any relationship would but overall i was in the black with this one she gave me two amazing kids and was a devoted wife and mother we met in highschool and it was a long and arduous courtship but she chose me amongst all the other suitors she could ve had it wasn t long after our marriage that she became pregnant with owen my cock panged god we had so much crazy sex back then a non stop love crazed free for all i was pretty sure i told myself i had enough of sex after the eighth time we did it one day but that was what made today special after twenty long busy years together i wanted to give her something special maybe if i m lucky i d get some of that sex funny how no matter how passionate we were as a young couple raising a family and having a full time job to support it does a real number on your libido and energy levels most of the time it was easier to jerk one off just so i didn t risk getting an errant boner at work i felt a little guilty maybe i should ve finished early but claire would ve insisted on me working like i usually do after rush hour i would ve saved hardly any time and this way at least i won t be behind on my paper work by the time monday rolled on over i said goodnight to jeff the janitor and made it home in half an hour thank god for quiet evening roads i announced myself as i got into my house we lived in a detached house in the countryside it was surrounded by farmer s fields and woodlands and a quarter mile from the main roads so it was convenient and gave us plenty of privacy i heard claire call from the kitchen and i could smell wonderful home cooking in the air seeing as it was friday i assumed paige was out i hoped she wasn t busy grinding against some random guy in a nightclub but i shook away such thoughts owen was probably playing on his computer we got him some outrageously overpriced gaming headphones for christmas and he was ecstatic it was a worthwhile investment because before then he was blaring his speakers out a bit too loudly for my tastes evening honey i said to claire giving her a cuddle from behind as she washed the dishes by the kitchen sink i couldn t help but lean in and take in the smell of her perfume mixed in with her own smells that never failed to stir up my need i gave the nape of her neck a kiss for good measure evening go have your food before it gets cold she smiled we sat around the dinner table and my tummy grumbled claire cooked us up a meal of steak potatoes and green beans my doctor told me to avoid eating too much red meat but i m sure i can overlook a special day like today claire had a plate too in front of her you shouldn t have waited if i knew i would ve come home earlier it s fine i wanted to have dinner with you i didn t complain further and we tucked in during the meal we talked about our day and if there s any gossip i asked about the kids and she told me paige was at her best friend s place that meant very little to me seeing as teenagers would say they re in one place and be somewhere else entirely i made a note to maybe give her a call if she s not home by midnight for now i kept overbearing father in check we talked more and laughed over too much red wine it always astounded me how the years were kind to my wife sure she had some lines on her face but it just made her look more refined she stayed trimmed by going to the gym often and it inspired me to skip the chocolate during lunch break it was the least i could do if claire made the effort to stay in shape the best thing of all though was that her breasts enlarged naturally and they didn t go down after her pregnancies if they did it wasn t by much christ i thought i was in luck having a wife with a killer milf body but it was torment to be honest nothing worse than having a sexy as fuck wife and a raging boner with no way to relieve it sometimes i welcome being too tired and falling asleep sometimes before i got too drunk i pulled a box out of my coat pocket claire i got this for you it s something small to tell you how much i love you and appreciate you i watched as my wife undid the ribbon and opened the box dean she gasped you shouldn t have it looks really expensive it was a gold necklace with a carat emerald stone scallop set diamonds surrounded the gem you re worth it happy anniversary i simply said claire tried it on and it really did suit her she came around the table and gave me a hug and a deep kiss the minute her mouth opened i couldn t help but delve my tongue into her mouth we were there for a few moments making out like teenagers completely unmindful of anyone who may walk in sorry i breathed forcing myself to push my wife away trying to ignore the aching hard on i had between my legs been a while since i kissed you like that no problem honey maybe we should make more time for each other it s not like i don t miss the intimacy she said her tone whispered and breathless claire held the necklace up to the light marvelling at the way the stones glinted and shimmered i was glad she seemed happy with it i have a present for you too it won t be as nice as what you got me mind what is it she gave me a kiss on the cheek why don t you go upstairs and have a shower first it s been a long day for you i stood under the hot water and felt the day s fatigue and stress wash away it was hard to contain the excitement bubbling in my stomach the present claire got me would most probably something luxurious like a armani tie or some really nice cufflinks she always told me that i looked dapper in a suit however i was hoping for something a little more physical the signs were there dinner as soon as i got in being ushered to have a quick wash we were busy people and i appreciated my wife re arranging things to free up the evening for us i got out of the shower feeling sufficiently refreshed i gave myself the quick once over in front of the bathroom mirror i wouldn t say i was buff but at least my body didn t turn into a complete dad bod quite just yet if anything i could ve sworn some of paige s friends check me out too either that or i m deluding myself i ve been out of the dating game for years who knows what goes through girls minds nowadays a quick splash of aftershave and i was ready to go to bed my cock pulse in anticipation would claire be wearing something subtle a teddie or would she wear something much more provocative like a corset either way was going to be good for me the bedroom was dimly lit when i got there the door to the en suite was open a crack and i could hear claire humming to herself she must ve sensed me because she said i ll be there now the moment i stepped into the room i climbed onto the bed not bothering to go under the sheets i mean there s not much point right i felt a little silly just lying there staring at the ceiling with my hands clasped together over my groin it was almost awkward that familiar sense of anticipation a promise of sex when i did it for my very first time of all the sexy outfits i had in mind i didn t expect claire to come out wearing that you like it she asked me umm yeah i uhh christ i was acting like a dumbstruck teenager at a complete loss for words my wife was wearing a schoolgirl outfit a badly fitting one the white shirt was a taut fit over her chest pulling tightly over her generous mounds accentuating the tips of her nipples a fat purposely shortened crimson and yellow tie snuggled comfortably between her cleavage she wore a wool cardigan over that not buttoned up the skirt was a short pleated affair that when she twirled giving me a show from behind barely covered the underside of her ass i caught a glimpse of her panties too blue and white striped pattern to finish she wore a pair of knee length wool socks and a pair of black flats my cock twitched it was an illicit fusion of innocence and sensuality y you look wonderful i managed almost like a dress up version of what paige used to wear my wife smiled not almost it is she clambered up onto the bed nestling her crotch down over mine i moved my hands out of the way in time to settle them under her skirt resting on her silky smooth inner thighs a low groan escaped my lips as she rocked her hips a little making my cock harden against her panty covered pussy y you re wearing paige s uniform i found it this morning when i did some cleaning up she smiled mischievously c mon honey we used to have so much fun playing dress up and it occurred to me that we never done the naughty schoolgirl thing do you like it or is it too weird are you being weirded out n no not at all i rasped my nose twinged claire wasn t wearing her usual perfume either i was used to the classy womanly scents she wore the new smell cut through me like a new foreign smell not foreign i didn t associate it with my wife it was an everyday deodorant that paige wore my wife noticed me noticing it too i thought i d go the extra mile i sprayed myself with some of paige s stuff is it distracting you i m fine it was but not in a bad way god i lusted after my wife but the way she dressed the way she smelled just reminded me of our daughter it wasn t just the naughty schoolgirl fantasy that was reeling in my mind right now but some of my darkest fantasies involving my daughter admittedly i might ve jerked off a few times over paige but this took it to a whole new level i licked my lips sucking a breath through my teeth as claire squeezed with her thighs grinding her hot pussy against the underside of my painfully hard cock oh god i hissed she keeps this up i m going to cum in my pants claire grabbed my wrists placing my hands over her tits enjoy it honey don t you like your present she rasped i swallowed her breasts were so familiar her body was something i saw almost every day yet never tired of i circled my thumbs delighting at how such a cheaply woven shirt could feel so fucking good right now my wife gave out a loud satisfied moan as i tweaked and played with her acorn hard nipples you re being too loud i said what if someone hears us we never had complete privacy claire groaned again not the slightest bit bothered she rocked her hips more grinding against my dick dry humping me and making me leak precum making it soak into my underwear don t worry so much daddy she whispered oh god owen is probably on his computer games wearing his headphones he won t hear a thing and paige is out right now my hands fell to the sides and claire pushed against my chest rocking away it felt good amazing even but it was torment i closed my eyes trying not to enjoy it too much but that made things worse it was too easy to picture my daughter on me right now grinding away at her daddy the thought made me feel both guilty for my wife and inconsolably excited at the same time c claire i m going to i stammered like a fool that all too familiar sensation pulsed through my dick ready to shoot my load but before i could claire climbed off me and pinched my urethra with her fingers stopping me ugh i groaned my body tensing against my need being denied not yet dean we haven t even started yet i sucked in more breath waiting for the need to ebb away my cock throbbed angrily okay i think i m good i finally said my wife smiled and hooked her fingers over the waistband of my boxer shorts she peeled them down and over my legs my dick was coated slimed over with my own precum wow you got really excited she murmured running a finger along its length drawing a sticky band of precum away as she did so i shuddered as her fingertip danced over my piss slit making me inflate again it was torment i never been teased like this before i thought she was going to jerk me off or give me a much needed anniversary blowjob but instead claire stood up on the bed looking up i coat see the stripy panties under her outrageously short skirt a flash of concern went through me did paige used to wear her uniform like this too claire slowly pulled off her panties letting them drop onto me onto my now rock hard cock pick them up she ordered i want you to smell them i did as i was told and brought the warm damp fabric to my face i groaned inwardly as the strong musky scent of my wife s arousal invaded my nostrils she must ve wanted this as much as me do you like the smell of pussy she asked i loved how the hornier claire got the more lewd her language becomes yeah it s got such a feminine sweetness to it i admitted i looked at her face hoping that was what she wanted to hear and she smiled there was more to the smile but at the moment i was too fogged up with need to figure it out i drew another breath and the intoxicating aroma made my dick rock hard all over again then a warm tight wetness engulfed me i groaned and looked down there my wife was dressed up like a slutty schoolgirl sucking me off oh shit claire i gasped her tongue did wondrous amazing things to the tip of my cock she lashed against my slit sending pulses of pure pleasure through me making my hips buck involuntarily when i thought i d reach the peak she would deftly let go and make circular motions not giving me the chance to recover then there was her hand god my dick was slick with precum and her saliva and claire was pumping my cock expertly slathering the fluids all over my shaft do you like that daddy she asked as she let my crown pop out of her mouth like a lollipop oh god baby that is so hot yeah i love it it s such a hot fantasy i admitted i indulged in more than a mere fantasy just a little bit i let my euphoric fogged up mind imagine it was paige sucking me off my toes curled as i let my wife bob up and down on my dick the room loud with her sucking noises she was so good at this i wondered if paige did this with other boys teens her age i bet that s what they do go see a film or get a burger and finish the night off with a blowjob parked somewhere discreet god knows that was what i d do if i could afford a car back in the day my nuts tightened up and i knew i was going to blow my load soon oh fuck paige i shit my eyes met my wife s and i braced myself for the inevitable fall out especially on our fucking anniversary of all days but instead of scorn and revulsion i saw no hint of emotion in her eyes all the while she carried on sucking me the terror of what was going to happen next staved off my need to cum for a little while longer then slowly almost delicately claire got off my dick and crawled up to me until we were face to face claire i shit sorry that was a mistake a slip of the tongue you don t have to apologise dean she whispered in my ear i felt her arm reach around and grab my dick slowly she aimed it against the hot wet entrance of her pussy i tried not to hiss as my tip grazed against her lips did you mistake me for our daughter it was so confusing that s all i mean you re wearing her stuff and you smell like her she moved back a little maybe an inch or so enough to let my lip push past her lips and into her hole enough for a taste of how tight her velvet channel was but nowhere near enough for me to enjoy it completely g god admit it dean she whispered admit that you fantasized about paige i i don t know what you re talking about claire sighed and squeezed her hips dislodging me from her cunt i tried to thrust to chase after her but she had a firm grip on my dick i wasn t going to be inside her without her say so let s try again she sat back down this time my cock rested against her pussy lips but she wasn t letting me go inside her i was beyond frustrated beyond desperate do you fantasize about paige i i may have jerked off once or twice thinking about her yes i swallowed it was no use i was good at a lot of things but lying to my wife wasn t one of them good boy she let go of her hand and my cock disappeared inside her a few slovenly inches i groaned incoherently she unbuttoned herself letting her oversized breasts push free of the shirt i stared in awe at the sight she grabbed my hands and placed them on her breasts and i kneaded them willingly i could tell from the way you look at her from the way she walks around in nothing but a t shirt and panties in the morning i didn t mean anything by it i haven t done anything with another woman i swear god that sounded preposterous as my hands didn t stop groping her tits feeling her nipples grinding against my palms i know honey you re a good man i wouldn t do anything to hurt you or paige i know she was rocking up and down on me now her pussy milking my dick from base to tip it was almost impossible to sound sincere while she was doing that to me don t get the wrong idea dean she continued i don t consider it as cheating strange isn t it maybe because she s our daughter not like some cheap whore from work or something i don t know what to say just enjoy it enjoy the fantasy call me paige while you fuck me my heart spasmed r really yes shit i grabbed her hips and rolled her so we swapped positions claire squealed as we continued having sex with me pumping my cock in and out of her soaking wet pussy she reached down and teased her clit oh paige i murmured fuck me daddy please i love having your cock inside me do you think about doing this to me all the time i growled everything was turning into a hot erotic blur fuck yes walking around with your panties like that i m a man too you re just asking to bend over and have a cock buried inside you maybe you should do it teach me a lesson fuck i fucked her even harder now my fingers dig into her soft fleshy ass as i pulled her tight against me claire s legs hooked behind me digging her heels into my ass beckoning me to unload all my frustrations deep inside her then she shoved the bundled up panties right up in my face take a long deep smell honey i did and the sharp sweet scent hit me again i ll let you in on a secret she said those are paige s panties she wore them today and i fished out of the clothes bin earlier that s right dean she moaned you re smelling your own daughter s pussy scent oh fuck i cried out my hips moved by themselves driving me harder and deeper into my wife s cunt t that s it she cried out fuck me daddy cum inside your naughty daughter s pussy p paige i cried out i knew it was my wife s willing pussy but at that moment i imagined it was my own daughter i was fucking god i never wanted anything more in my life my cock swelled and my cum blasted forth deep into my wife s waiting pussy i m cumming too claire cried out teasing her clit she shuddered and clamped her legs tight around me as she climaxed i drove my hips hard against her pretending it was my own daughter i was inseminating seeing that it was my wife instead fuck i don t know i loved them both through the haze i felt claire embrace me comforting me as i emptied out the last of my seed in her weakened i collapsed on top of her s shit i said it s okay honey she replied stroking the back of my head it was all just a fantasy right it s whatever you want it to be i don t think i understand she chuckled i lost you for a moment there when you uttered paige s name it was like you were somewhere else like you were actively trying to imagine it was here i searched for any signs of hurt in her eyes but found none don t look at me like that all i m saying is it was kinda hot i m comfortable enough with my husband to be fine with his kinks i draw the line at you fucking another woman but if it s paige i guess that s fine with me i swallowed i uhh i wouldn t even know how to go about that despite my orgasm my dick stirred again at the idea of actually seducing my own daughter she might not even be into me that s your problem i m just saying it s a green light from me i won t help you though you got to figure out how to do it yourself and if paige is even interested i guess i said i was breathless exhausted and there were too many things racing through my mind right then claire tapped me and i rolled off her to my side of the bed one thing though you can t get mad if i end up playing with owen huh goodnight honey happy anniversary claire turned over to settle before i could ask her what she meant by that thank you for reading download a free copy of this epub here which include links to my other free stories get the complete series here
38743,i didn t know why i felt this way but when i tried to hit on a girl i freak out my stomach tensed up into knots and my throat went dry and raspy every time without fail when i saw a girl i found attractive it happens i m and i wouldn t say i was particularly ugly i wasn t not a model or anything but i get plenty of looks from girls around campus i played a lot of sports and hoped to jump into uni on a football scholarship but that damn vee card i knew it wasn t a big deal most guys were still virgins at my age well if you considered of guys i read that somewhere the problem was all my mates were testosterone filled males every one of them were in their prime shagging girls left right and center i loved playing footie but sometimes the teasing from the lads could be infuriating i was about to leave college after the last class of the day finished i rounded the corner and bumped into a lock of long blonde hair sophie turner one of the girls in my class she was insanely cute and had one of the best rated rears in college i had a crush on her for years but i was content with admiring her from afar in classes we were in together hey leo how are you h hi i stuttered the thing with my nerves it was like a self fulfilling prophecy i got nervous and it made my speech go all weird and then that made me even more nervous i watched you play today you re really talented my family are big into footie god she smelled nice and her eyes were big and round and this was the bit i was supposed to ask her for her number t thanks i guess that familiar churning in the pit of my stomach revved up like a sputtering engine say do you fancy doing something sometime like grab something to eat or yeah that d be nice lots of talking one on one interactions and me thinking about what i was supposed to say next and then what she s gonna find out what a weirdo i am and go tell everyone i was going to get a reputation i need to make sure the oven isn t left on yeah my brain went stupid too oh well anytime i guess she said her face a mask of confusion she walked off and i knew i made an ass of myself note to self rush out after class do not let myself get ambushed i drove home in my beat up vauxhall corsa blaring out some random dance compilation cds to drown out the anxiety bubbling in my gut the car was a bit ugly but it had a solid engine if i ended up in a university away from home i needed to make sure the damn thing still ran i parked the car onto the driveway and when i entered the house it was quiet the clock on the wall said a few minutes after pm so mum and dad weren t back yet i couldn t tell with emma though emma was a few years older than me but unlike me she had her shit together she studied at a local university and as a result stayed at home to save on accommodations her lectures were sporadic and you never knew when she was home or not she studied medicine so she was a bit of a golden child as far as mum and dad were concerned not that i had problem with that but while ems was making the best use of her time i was still kicking a football around and waiting for the next fifa game to come out for my xbox i headed upstairs for a shower to make my day extra special the heavens opened up and i was drenched on my way to the car i peeled off my wet rags and bundled them up about to stick them in the laundry bin until something caught my eye it was a dark red lacey ball of fabric i swallowed i picked them up and unfurled it it was a pair of emma s knickers i knew it was hers because it was bundled together in a pair of her jeans mum didn t wear jeans i wasn t a pervert honest but something triggered inside me right then emma was the only girl that didn t make me nervous okay she was my sister but she was a beautiful girl too as a guy you couldn t help but appreciate a fine female body emma had a juicy curvy ass gorgeous face with ever so slightly plump lips lips that promised to do wicked things if you let them she had big boobs too at least more than and handful the lads liked to give me shit about how i had a hot sister and kept asking me to help them hook up with her as if i was going to whore my own sister out like that but still she was hot in a refined and nerdy way emma wasn t big on words and those who didn t know her would think she was cold and unapproachable i licked my lips as i looked at the fabric in my hands the gusset just had her dried on juices i didn t know what came over me i mean i wasn t hurting anyone my hands shook the thrill of doing something i wasn t supposed to made my heart pound hard i pressed the thin material against my nose and inhaled fucking hell a thick pungent aroma flooded my nose it was a sweet feminine scent with just the slightest hint of sourness to it did the smell disgust me not at all in my nakedness my cock lurched to life fuck i growled i just wanted to know what a girl smelled like i should put it down and go for a fucking shower my other hand gripped my cock it was awkward because i usually used my right hand but i didn t want to let go of the panties i jerked off furiously not even porn made me this aroused emma i whispered to nobody it felt like a dirty little secret which only made it even hotter i pounded hard the urge to cum overwhelming me fucking hell ems i groaned picturing her naked on her knees and encouraging me to rub it out i inhaled more intoxicating myself with my own sister s scent my cock swelled in my hand and i had a second before the inevitable would happen i didn t know why i did what i did i pulled the panties down to my dick and with a growl i ejaculated i shot load after load of my pent up cum into emma s panties a strange primitive part of me aimed for the gusset wanting my cum to coat over her stains a dark thrill crawled up my spine as i indulged in a sick fantasy picturing emma walking around casually oblivious and wearing her panties soaked with my semen god why did that sound so hot and then something caught the corner of my eye i looked to the side and there was emma watching me watching my dick emptying itself into her panties her stone cold expression gave nothing away she simply turned and left fuck fuck shit bollocks i considered going after my sister but what would i say sorry for jerking off into your panties sorry for being a perverted little shit oh god i spent a few agonising hours in my bedroom i felt safe and maybe i could stay in there forever or maybe i should plan on where to go when dad kicked me out later i had like in savings fuck my anxiety shot through the roof when my parent s car pull onto the drive mum was going to make dinner and it wouldn t be long before she was going to tell me to come downstairs i had a wash earlier but it didn t calm me down any fresh sweat bloomed all over my body i went downstairs passing by emma s room on the way the door looked more locked than it ever was before what will she say to our parents maybe i should take the initiative tell them myself that i accidentally jerked off into emma s panties yeah right mum was busy humming away at an s pop song in her head and dad was already in front of the tv catching up on his shows i smelled pasta sauce so it was going to be a quick meal emma would be down in like minutes i said hi to them and joined dad in the living room my heart banging against my ribcage a million miles an hour then a few minutes later i sensed emma coming downstairs sensed because she was light on her feet mum made some commotion the usual how was your day and emma s usual response mum called for me and dad to join them around the dining room table and that felt like the longest walk ever i kinda felt like i was on death row or something i sat down and emma didn t make eye contact with me in fact she sat farthest away from me mum asked me what i did in college and all that and i waited for emma to spill the beans on me it never came dad discussed tomorrow the big saturday date that they did once a month mum and dad disappeared all day a day just for them couldn t blame them it was one of the tricks to keeping their relationship healthy as far as dad was concerned i hoped i lived long enough to experience that for myself one day we all convened in the living room and emma sat on the other side of the sofa with mum between us dad took the armchair we watched a few programmes and i wondered if emma felt the awkwardness hanging in the air for some stupid reason my head wandered to other thoughts other than imminent doom i loved the way the glasses framed her face ems kinda looked like a much sexier version of velma from scooby doo but with longer hair it was getting late and dad yawned mum took that as a cue and they both retired for the night leaving me alone with my sister when mum and dad were safety upstairs emma turned to look at me we need to talk you know what it s about she said her tone neutral i nodded sucking in a breath what i saw earlier in the bathroom i wasn t mistaken was i no i managed to squeeze out i m disappointed in you little brother i thought you knew better than to play around with other people s property i m sorry i just got carried away how did you get carried away doing something like that it s just i was horny and i saw your pants and i just my face burned red i m sorry please don t think badly of me emma sighed you need a girlfriend you cannot do things like that you ll turn into a deviant i tried but i can t i m no good with girls what do you mean you re generally a pleasant person my assessments conclude that girls would want to date you that s exactly it girls do want to date me but i can t i i freeze up when i interact with them i don t know why exactly but i m not comfortable around other girls you re okay with me and mum that s different i guess you re family emma stared at me intently as if she was looking right into my soul after what seemed like forever she let out a deep sigh just don t do it again okay promise okay she stood and went upstairs leaving me feeling utterly ashamed and reprimanded johnny lobbed the ball over to me and i carved the ball into the net the friendly game ended me and the lads whooped and cheered at the victory it was only a kick about but we take sometimes took it too seriously i knew i had potential but deep down i doubt i d make it to premier league or anything the most realistic path for me was uni get a sports degree and be a coach or personal trainer or something that is if i got over my morbid fear of interacting with women the boys congregated over the side of the field i joined them and fished out my phone and bottle of energy drink as usual the guys were chatting up some girls who liked to hang around when we were playing i tried to casually keep my distance while also looking like i m with the group the lads joked and teased the girls and they walked off what do you reckon johnny asked all of a sudden what them birds they are going to the club tonight we re joining them you should come i got other things to do c mon bro you always blowing us off eric said suddenly wrapping his arm around my head putting me in a headlock don t be a pussy come for a drink with us and get laid i pried myself out of his arms and my phone lit up it was a message from emma are you free later it was saturday and mom and dad were gone maybe sis needed me to do something with her sure just on the field with the lads i will be home later i have something to discuss with you okay can t tell if that was good or not i ll even buy you a pint johnny said can t got plans with emma i said holding my phone up as if it was a get out of jail free card tell your sis she can make plans with me anytime johnny said grabbing his nuts the other lads laughed with him i smirked and flipped them the bird i headed straight home and went to the bathroom to wash the muck off i stopped at the laundry bin again and guilt washed all over me the contents were calling to me like a moth to a flame i chastised myself for even considering it i made a damn promise to my sister i shoved my dirty gear into the bin and rinsed myself off as clean as possible then i pulled on a t shirt and shorts and went downstairs with a bowl of cornflakes for lunch i settled down to a couple of rounds of call of duty in the living room i didn t even hear emma come in she dropped a few medical tomes in front of me on the coffee table got a minute sure so i did some research regarding your compulsion wait what there s a medical issue with sniffing panties not that your anxiety when it comes to interacting with women okay do you know what gynophobia is she asked pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose just that it s a phobia of some sort correct a fear of women any idea what might have triggered it a fear of women can t say i ever been attacked by a girl or anything i heard of people developing a fear of dogs after they ve been bitten though don t think so think harder it might not seem like a big deal or something that happened recently like a subconscious fear buried deep down uhh i made a focused effort to think up times i had a bad experience with women then an event dislodged in the back of my head sally saunders sally was a girl i had a massive crush on at school i was or at the time at the height of my puberty i chanced it and told her i fancied her not only did sally reject me she laughed at me and others joined in i was a weirdo for asking her out go figure i was known as spotty leo back then due to my acne issues thankfully it all cleared up now i was traumatised back then though i couldn t face going to school and my parents ended up transferring me to another school with everything going on i kinda forgot about it i assumed my nervousness around girls was just me being shy maybe it was more than that i m going to help you emma said how take me to therapy i can see two issues you re dealing with right now your irrational fear of women and your intense libido that s the only logical conclusion i can hypothesize uhh i suppose so what do you propose lock me in a room with girls until i don t feel nervous around them take off your shorts she said suddenly what strip you need to desensitise yourself there s no way you can do it with another girl and i don t trigger your anxiety so i m the only one who can help you i don t know if i can it s kinda weird not as weird as me walking in on my little brother masturbating into my panties you re never going to let that go are you just teasing you emma replied deadpan i gave out a sigh and looked up to the ceiling as if there were going to be answers written up there i really don t need to go to university being afraid of women it would be hell okay fuck it let s do this i didn t feel nervous in that way not the anxiety inducing way that felt different but it didn t mean i was comfortable whipping my dick out in front of my sister i pushed the band of my shorts down together with my boxers a gasp escaped her lips what nothing i didn t expect you to be so big really i looked down i guess it was big but the only other penises i saw were in porn and they all looked around my size emma sat there on her knees in front of me and i was standing there with my dick out the way she looked at me laser focused and intense made me feel like a lab rat well oh right i grabbed my floppy dick and gave it a few strokes emma couldn t keep her eyes off it maybe it was the strangeness of the situation but my dick wasn t getting hard i usually did it in the privacy of my bedroom one hand on my dick and the other holding my phone streaming some porn i d usually have the volume on silent but if there wasn t anyone around i d indulge myself in the sound of the girls moaning this was completely different it was the middle of the day in the living room and emma was watching what s wrong isn t this how guys masturbate she asked i can t seem to relax i replied tugging away at my dick uselessly oh well do you need some visual aid maybe some porn would help yeah sure all of a sudden emma pulled her top over her head in seconds emma went from clothed to being topless her breasts covered up by her bra jesus whatever porn i saw up till now it didn t compare to the full voluptuous tits emma had they were so big and round and way more than a handful my cock throbbed and i felt it harden in my hand i pumped and pumped sometimes i had my eyes closed still feeling semi self conscious of emma s penetrating gaze and sometimes i tried not to feast my eyes on her fantastic breasts she didn t seem bothered by me looking at them i still wasn t rock hard though what s wrong is it this hard for men to induce arousal i dunno still feels a bit hard to fully relax it was weird but emma s eyes had a strange glazed over look as if she was mesmerized by my hand movements that is understandable these are peculiar circumstances after all let me help she reached out and grabbed my shaft pushing my hand away oh crap i cried out not used to the sudden sensation of someone else s hand on my dick emma s hand felt silky soft and warm against my throbbing shaft i hardened immediately much better she breathed my dick inflated until she couldn t wrap her fingers around my thickness anymore it grew to its full size in my sister s hand her fingers danced up and down along my shaft until it curved and pointed towards her i stood there ramrod straight not really knowing where to put my hands emma kept pumping away slowly and methodically almost in sync with her breathing which seemed to me to be a bit more laboured than normal her face was so close to my cock i felt the warmth of her breath brushing against my dick it was all so surreal and exciting a drop of precum beaded out of my slit and ran down coating my sister s fingers oh shit sorry i said that s okay i don t mind it i swallowed down a gulp my heart pounded hard against my ribcage emma seemed happy to do this for me i wanted to chance something she was so perfect so beautiful and i wanted to see more of her ems do you think if you wouldn t mind think you can give me more of a visual aid she looked up at me an eyebrow raised her hand still kept pumping away at my cock and if i didn t know any better i swear she was giving me a slightly bemused look she reached around with her free hand and unhooked the straps of her bra her bra fell away and i groaned emma s massive tits bounced freely as she jerked me off her grip tightened even more it felt amazing with my precum lubing up my shaft but her tits fucking hell i haven t seen anything so perfect in my life her nipples were as hard as acorns with a blushing of brown around them her breasts were so big and natural and the sight of them sent a bolt of excitement that went straight to my dick am i doing this correctly she asked moving her hand maddeningly slowly up my shaft and giving it a delicious twist at the tip y yeah sis feels even better than when i do it myself i m glad she smiled at me and her face blushed a little they say that when you re aroused you gave off a smell i wondered if emma could smell my arousal but if she did she didn t seem to mind it my balls tightened that familiar tell tale sign threatened to overwhelm me soon it was all too much her velvety soft hand on my cock her gorgeous breasts bouncing in time to her hand movements the very fact that my own sister by all intents and purposes was jerking me off right now oh god ems you need to stop i m going to cum i groaned but she didn t stop if anything she tightened her grip on my desperate aching cock i bit down on my lip my fingers clenching and digging into my palms anything to stay the inevitable i cried out my cock swelled for one last time and i came emma had her eyes down on my cock her hand a rapid blur as she pumped and pumped she yelped as the first load of cum blasted forth and hit her square in the face then another load shot out just as violently then another ropes of cum blasted out coating emma s beautiful face and hair because she gasped some of it landed in her mouth and glossed over her lips but her hand didn t stop she kept milking me coaxing the rest of the cum out of me the rest streaked downwards hitting her chest and painting all over her cleavage i grunted and moaned uncontrollably at the complete mercy of emma s pumping hand and not stopping until i emptied my balls out all over her only when my semen was reduced to droplets did emma let go i staggered backwards spent and weak and barely managed to stay upright how did that feel she whispered g good i admitted i meant if it triggered any anxiety oh y yeah nothing triggered i just felt good she simply nodded i didn t know if she was aware of it but she licked her lips seemingly not bothered about the taste of my cum in her mouth the sight of it made my cock twinge with need again almost methodically as such was the way with many of things emma did she folded her blouse up neatly and draped it over her arm i m going to go clean up i will help you with your condition when i have the time okay i answered emma walked off not concerned about her exposed breasts i kept my eyes on them bouncing as she took each step upstairs trying to commit the image to memory wait did she say she will continue to help with my condition thank you for reading please go to to download a free copy of this epub with links to other free books included or get the entire series here

39688,with the joe rogan board being shut down and all the posts being deleted i decided to repost this op from because it was one of favorite and i don t think it should be lost forever the name of the poster who wrote all this got lost so if anyone remembers let me know all i ll update the op this might be the craziest bath salt story you ever read warning long post the story begins when a man named john mcaffee goes to college gets a degree and launches a handful of successful technology startup companies in the early s when the market was hot one of those companies mcaffee anti virus eventually sells for roughly million dollars and he is set for life he then invents a new sport which mostly involved rich white guys with way too much money and time on their hands flying high speed experimental aircraft very close to the ground not surprisingly one of these old white rich guys dies doing this and the family decides to sue john for million dollars john sells all of his us assets and moves to belize where they coincidentally do not recognize us law and anyone seeking any sort of compensation from john as a result of any us ruling will probably never see that money also the age of consent in belize is so he wastes no time in shacking up with a girl years younger than him so far this is all a fairly normal white guy problems story but this is where it gets weird apparently while in belize john discovers something called methylenedioxypyrovalerone mdpv which happens to be the active ingredient in what is now commonly known as bath salts and he likes it sadly though at some point the market shifts and the quality of commercially available mdpv deteriorates so john sets out to make his own high grade mdpv that s right he begins freebasing bath salts the same shit that makes people eat your face off he starts making the crack version of it in his quest to make the ultimate face eating zombie powder he begins posting on a drug forum asking for tips and advice gt hello everyone i ve been lurking here for years and just recently decided to join up i m hoping to get some help here gt i m a huge fan of mdpv not the white hydrochloride it s inconceivable that anyone on the planet would willingly put that into their bodies i m talking the freebase form i think many of you that don t bother to freebase it yourself have at least tasted the freebase version when it was widely available as tan mdpv i think it s the finest drug evere conceived not just for the indescribable hypersexuality but also for the smooth euphoria and mild comedown gt my question is this how can i more easilly separate the oil from the precipitate using some mechanical means gt here s the nightmarish process i ve been going through so far gt first i precipitate and then place the container on a foot vibrator for minutes to raise the first oil the oil is heavier than water by the way gt gt then i painstakingly touch each droplet with the point of a hyperdermic which causes the oil to climb up the needle then i slowly extract the needle until the surface tension at the top allows the oil to float gt gt i can only do a small amount at a time or else the oil collects into a ball large enough to sink again i draw off the oil with a filed down needle point and then spend another mitues of vibrating until the next batch rises as i proceed the droplets become smaller and smaller until they are barely visible the complete extraction takes to hours gt for anyone who freebases mdpv by the way the oil is dangerous beyond belief when i first started doing this i accidently got a few drops on my fingers while handling a used flask and didn t sleep for days i had visual and auditory hallucinations and the worst paranoia of my life it s all the bad aspects of white mdpv times a hundred if you think the comedown from the white mdpv is bad rub this oil into your skin you ll be begging for a hundred milligram dose of the white in exchange use rubber gloves gt anyway can someone tell me how i can mechanically separate the oil from the precipitate in less than hours i definitaely don t want to use a reagent i m not a chemist or any kind of scientist by the way just someone who refused to accept the new mdpv gt thank you you see somewhere along the way while john was trying to freebase bath salts he seems to have stumbled across an entirely new drug at least that s what he thinks every chemist and chemical company tells him what he has is still just plain old mdpv and that s not surprising considering all he is doing is concentrating it but he is convinced his freebase is still somehow diifferent like the alchemists of old he has magically transmuted the properties of the mundane to the truly divine and by divine i mean after ingesting just mg of his magical bath salt zombie crack he and his year old girlfriend had wild untamed monkey sex for straight hours naturally members of the forum are skeptical that he has found the holy grail of bath salts especially considering john freely admits that his freebase method is a bit sloppy rudimentary very time consuming and rarely produces the desired drug hence his coming to the forum and asking for advice in the first place gt if you do try it here is what happens the white hcl is on the right the precipitate left out for hours in water and air is on the left the precipitate after hours is in the middle it continues to degrade all the way through dark brown over the course of a week the color in the center is what you re looking for in terms of best characteristics when dried it remains stable gt gt note the above posts are simply freebasing instructions for the hcl form of mdpv to my knowledge there is no synthesis involved or transformation into any chemical other than mdpv gt p s do not touch the oil extremely dangerous and never take more than mg of the tan colored form at one time the good news is when you are a millionaire living in belize freebasing bath salts you have plenty of time on your hands to make more bath salt crack to freebase with your year old girlfriend and post about it on the internet gt i just tried it with ml of water mg of pv mg of soda and no heating and you can see the oil residue on the sides of the beaker so ml and cold solution should be no problem although to fully recover your pv you do have to heat it i didn t wait for the powder to fully precipitate before i took the pic you can see it just starting to form the slightly darker thin layer on the bottom just wanted to see if the oil was produced and precipitate would begin gt gt i can only assume that your pv is something other than pv gt if you do get it right here s what it should look like after hours of evaporation i scraped the lower half for drying for the next pic gt gt here s the lower half after drying and before grinding back into a powder gt gt after hours of evaporation you get the following it s still very good but not as good as the previous color gt gt both of the above colored forms are highly potent don t eyeball dosage if you re used to the white pv you will certainly overdose on this stuff because it is three times heavier by volume than the white stuff if you achieve a color similar to the first one above then it s potency is hard to overstate always weigh it and never do more than mg at a time mg of this is not much larger than a pinhead gt a side note heat is required to begin the transformation for example if you don t heat the solution at all during precipitation you will be left with a light yellow substance that has exactly the same poor characteristics of white mdpv if you don t provide enough heat the same thing will happen you ll know when not enough heat has been applied because after hours of evaporation your mix will have a light greenish yellow cast with no orange tint there will be no tan hue it will look like this gt gt if the oil has a nice egg yolk color to it then the heating has been perfect gt gt if the yellow green color happens don t worry you haven t lost anything add water pour it back in the flask and heat slowly as described in an earlier post two saucepans for a couple of hours redo everything and the tan mdpv will appear gt there are dozens of things that can go wrong during this process none of them irreversible and there are a few possible end products that might look like the tan but aren t overheating the solution for example produces something after evaporation and drying that looks exactly like tan mdpv but merely gives massive incapacitating headaches when bumped no euphoria no high no hypersexuality if you run into problems i ll be happy to help meanwhile rumors begin circulating around belize that the eccentric millionaire who lives in their neck of the woods is becoming increasingly eccentric he spends days on end and all hours of the night hidden away in his jungle compound with a small harem of teenage girls just what the hell is he doing in there gt i ve processed kilos of this stuff in the past year or so and bump it myself every day in fair quantities the hypersexuality is beyond belief i have had a number of acquaintances both male and female who have rubbed their genitals way past the point of bleeding and still couldn t stop gt in all honesty a first time user or a user on a large dose when presented with food will simply figure out a way to include it in the ongoing sex play with their partner if alone they will figure out a way to fuck it or shove it up their rectum this is not a joke everything on the tan becomes a sex partner or a sex aid if only visually i will not anymore let anyone on tan be alone with my dogs for example i have dogs twice in the past year tan users one man one woman both after major massive doses to be fair attempted to have sex with one of my dogs one user again after a hugely massive dose was arrested in a local village here for publicly molesting strangers fortunately in my country such a crime is punishable by a small fine at worst so perhaps the appetite suppression that initially comes on is really an appetite disinterest water though dehydration is a major danger throughout force yourself to hydrate when on the tan it s way worse than mdma especially in higher doses in terms of suppressing thirst watch your urine if it gets darker stop what your doing and drink water gt over the past two years i have played with mdpv using ether tuloene xylene baking soda galacial acetate vinegar water ethanol and dirt from my garden the bacterial connection i have precipitated heated frozen incubated dissolved evaporated combined and separated every possible combination of precipitate solution and oil in the process i have come up with substances that were less than enjoyable to ingest i am my only test subject for these experiments i temporarily blinded myself for three hours after drying and ingesting a brown goo that appeared after five days of incubating an odd gray precipitate after an ether acetate experiment with pv i once ended up with a dark brown substance that looked similar to the darker tan pv versions it gave me an incapacitating headache that lasted days i had overheated the pv oil during precipitation and created something horrible i got pv oil on my skin and didn t sleep for hours during which time hellish visual and auditory hallucinations had me locked in the bathroom where i hid in the bathtub for hours my first hit of the acetate salt that i created from the tan had me hallucinating again for a few days i had not considered that the salt version of the tan freebase might have dosages measured in micrograms i should have guessed from the huge residual slush left over from the acetic acid wash but i didn t i bumped milligrams micrograms is a large dose gt what i m saying is that my body is barely being held together and what little cohesion is left is the result of vitamins and pure will power so i just don t have the courage to go down the acetate road the hcl road has used me up gt you should have seen some of my forum posts on other boards when i was overdosing on pv holy shit this dude claims to have discovered a psycho sexual drug so potent you will rub your dick into a bloody stump after rage fucking the family dog after just one bump what do you do when you are a millionaire living in a third world country who has discovered a means to produce the ultimate sex drug and you have a harem of year old girls addicted to it buy better lab equipment and start passing the shit out like candy gt and this might be the place to talk about pure tan my first post in this thread alluded to the process and visually showed some of the procedures i purposely obfuscated a little because well i did a lot of work to figure out how to make it pure and it s not really necessary for the average user anyway the quick and dirty which anyone can do is well explained above and produces imho the finest chemical ever to appear on this planet i m a perfectionist however and spent the better part of this past year honing a purification procedure i won t talk about how to do because it wouldn t be germane to the average kitchen cook it requires among other unwieldy implements a rotovap gt gt an airclean system gt gt a reasonably powerful microscope that will connect to a computer so you can do detailed microscopic measurements and an incubator gt gt it s not a fun process five consecutive full hour workdays will produce only this gt gt a one milligram dose of this whatever this is is scary a mg dose unchaperoned would be unquestionable fatal or at least massively harmful mostly from the uncontrollable insanity it would bring into your life keep in mind that the end product of the quick and dirty approach that i outlined contains less than of this substance precipitate unavoidable loss through evaporation mdpv contamination etc so a mg dose of the quick and dirty is a good time a mg dose of the pure would be a time you would never forget and probably never want to repeat gt what i do here with my friends and acquaintances who rightly worship this stuff is mix it to with ground up excedrin and wrap it in mg doses gt gt why excedrin first large doses of the tan is socially harmful at the least and people are people they don t use the best judgment sometimes powdered excedrin bumped or plugged in doses of more than mg in a single day will cause massive pain bleeding and discomfort it is a deterrent to crossing the line into extreme danger second daily use of the tan causes a a slight background headache for some users after a few days me included mg of excedrin powder bumped removes it entirely but since people are people a number of folks have figured out how to remove the excedrin by mixing the batch in a large quantity of water the excedrin remains in suspension for or minutes the pure tan falls to the bottom almost immediately they siphon off the suspension and are left with an extremely dangerous substance dangerous because it is utterly impossible to measure a safe dosage of the pure substance without possessing a scale costing thousands of dollars there have already been harmful events with people who have purified my excedrin mix gt a local brothel owner prostitution is legal in my country talked me out of a large amount of tan and provides it to his working girls and their customers the idea was to simply increase business by having hornier customers and more authentic product it worked for a while and then girls started taking larger doses and giving customers larger doses they began leaving and running off with customers some after a single contact with the customer two of these men were married had good jobs and children that they loved it has to be obvious even to the most casual observer that this is massively disruptive and borders on insanity gt if a person takes a large dose of the tan and has the misfortune to have no partner at the time then truly terrible things happen a number of men and women have molested strangers after massive doses of the pure product which is why i no longer provide it to anyone other than trusted friends everything else is cut to one twice users on large doses have tried to molest my dogs again even the most casual observer will see the danger in this gt i have distributed over doses exclusively in this country they call it spt i named it and it is a seriously hot underground topic here i know of at least a dozen people who spend virtually full time playing with this and hundreds trying to get samples which i dole out with meticulous care anyone caught sharing this with another without my consent doesn t get any more now in case you think our man is simply obsessed with the singular pursuit of his tan his name for the his special mdpv crack you should know he is open to all avenues of exploration as evidenced by the following photos he shared with his new drug forum friends gt tan is not the only thing that has come out of mdpv and i am not the only person producing stuff i try to keep track of all the recreational products on the world market looking for constituents that provide evidence that other people are walking down this same path gt gt it also contains trace amounts of a salvia divinorum based product i ve been playing around myself with combining tiny amounts of salvia based chemicals with the tan hugely awesome but i can t get a dosage that works for everyone yet gt for those of you who have tried salvia you will recognize the leaves below the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogen gt gt salvinorin a the active ingredient in salvia when processed correctly yields a hypersexual compound that surpasses the tan if you can even get mind around the concept but its side effects for even a tiny overdose are debilitating uncontrollable shaking frothing at the mouth which oddly doesn t detract from its sexual appeal if both partners are on it so minimal doses are required and the effects of these small doses are additive when combined with the tan the salvia based chemical in this bolivian brew is different from the one i use but very close i ve been trying to figure out how they made it so what to do after you ve exposed yourself on the internet as a rich third world drug fiend sex addict simple post everything about yourself short of your social security number before the drugs wear off gt i suppose it s time i should introduce myself gt my name is john and my main focus is the effect of medicinal tropical plants on bacteria and vice versa i don t need to tell you my exact location because it doesn t really matter imagine there s no country as another john once said gt to do any decent research in this field i had to be near tropical plants jungles have tropical plants so i moved to this place gt gt until supplies could arrive after which i built the lab gt gt and stocked it with stuff that i would need in order to do research gt gt gt gt gt gt then i went about the task of bringing some small civilization into the heart of darkness gt gt but of course after a three day bender freebasing bath salts and fucking your teenage harem girls the paranoia finally sets in gt ok so i did what i came here to do i ve had fun and i hope i ve given some of you food for thought but i have to get back to the real world the on line world is more of a distraction than the self induced effects of the many experiments i ve done using my own body over the past year or so and i have work to do gt i m going to delete all of my posts in this thread i m afraid that unless i can answer questions for people the information will be more confusing than helpful i myself won t have the time to log back on here i may lurk again from time to time though two days should be enough time for those of you in the middle of making quick tan to ask your questions and get your answers those of you i ve given my email to in private messages that email address won t be valid in a couple of days those to whom i gave my phone number same thing gt so ask what you need if anything before i move on not trying to be dramatic i just can t spare any more time away from the work i ve been on a semi sebatical since i started this thread gt you are a good bunch of people however a few more bumps of the zombie sex crack and john is back with gusto describing his sexcapades with teenage girls under the influence of his mystery drugs gt impossible to stay away from this thread the dance is seductive it is entirely possible i believe to break every known sexual taboo and indulge in activities that many would describe as monstrously depraved with the one that you love and have both partners feel elevated by the experience but then john disappears again with one last cryptic post gt i have photos of the boss fucking dogs in my safe at home i think my job is secure where did john disappear to well perhaps not surprisingly after admitting on a public forum that you are experimenting with powerful hallucinogenic sex drugs in your home lab with teenage girls and then passing this stuff out to thousands of people the cops are going to be a tad bit interested even if it is a third world country and you are worth millions of dollars so on may nd of this year the gsu gang suppression unit raided john s home during the raid they found a cache of firearms and a year old girl along with piles of cash and large quantities of mystery powders he was charged with running a meth lab after so many locals had reported the effects of this crazy drug that he was manufacturing and distributing of course the catch is mdpv is perfectly legal in belize and therefore so is whatever the fuck he is making with it until it can be identified so they let him go now anyone who has had any experience with meth speed mdpv and the long sleepless binges that usually follow suit can tell you one of the unfortunate side effects is massive paranoia after prolonged use even john admitted he was not immune to this in fact many reporters who spoke to john around the time he was posting his research spoke of his increasingly bizarre and paranoid behavior i would imagine having the gang suppression unit kick in your doors with ak s would probably not do much to alleviate that paranoia either which is why i was only partially surprised to read today that john mcaffee is now wanted for questioning in the murder of his neighbor gregory faull apparently faull was annoyed by the constant barking of mcaffee s dogs who lived just yards away and were presumably very loud sex partners so he filed a complaint with the local police when that failed to produce results however faull took matters into his own hands and began poisoning the dogs the day after the dogs were found dead faull was found in a pool of blood with a bullet in his head and now john mcaffee is on the run reportedly afraid that the police will kill him

40011,hey thought i d copypasta a previous r conspiracy post i made with some minor changes the official autopsy report for jfk written days after his death and mortuary examination reads gt the projectiles were fired from a point behind and somewhat above the level of the deceased the report was written by dr james humes of bethesda naval hospital the lead autopsy surgeon who handled kennedy s body after it was flown to bethesda maryland from dallas texas the autopsy report was partially based on notes handwritten during the body examination including measurements the above and behind official party line was elaborated on by humes in his warren commission testimony gt mr specter what conclusions did you reach then as to the trajectory or point of origin of the bullet dr humes based on gt commander humes we reached the conclusion that this missile was fired toward the president from a point above and behind him sir arlen specter was referring to commission exhibit also see commission exhibit these drawings were made by a medical illustrator working by the recollections of the autopsy pathologists but it is certainly apparent by those illustrations that the small proposed entrance in the back of the head is anatomically lower than the exit location since kennedy s brain was not properly sectioned and photographed to determine the path of the missile s the reported holes and beveling identified in the skull bone is provided as the only proof that the the head wounds were created by a single shot from behind the above in above and behind could only only justified by the flawed assumption that kennedy s head was sharply forward at the moment of impact which is drawn in ce and that cannot be true during humes testimony allen dulles of the cia expresses puzzlement over the steep upwards angle through the head proposed in the ce and drawings humes then admits that since the reconstruction of the skull during the autopsy was incomplete and therefore point of exit could have been a little lower than the ce and drawings depict according to humes the point of exit was determined at the autopsy when a large piece of skull bone allegedly found on the floor of the limousine was later flown in from dallas and this fragment had an area of exit beveling of the edge of it in other words they could not prove that this point of exit was ever a through and through bullet hole in cases of a tangential wound a bullet could just clip the skull from the side and leave a streak of exit beveling instead of a through and through entrance and exit hole so proving a whole exit hole was not done by dr pierre finck the forensic pathologist at the autopsy assisting humes who identified the beveling this fragment was right parietal bone here s an x ray taken of this skull fragment at the autopsy before it was allegedly placed back onto the head for the later cosmetic reconstruction and buried with the rest of the body the right parietal bone is anatomically higher than the location of the small wound where the pathologists reported a missile entered way higher ce tilted to match the zapruer frame z establishing that the autopsy pathologist s proposed entrance location in the head was anatomically lower than their proposed exit location on the top right side of the head on the night of the autopsy the pathologists sure weren t thinking above and behind we have information from the night of the autopsy showing that the location of this beveled exit on the skull bone was anatomically higher than the small head wound autopsy face sheet diagram marked during the body examination showing a dot indicating the small head wound in the back of the head this document is actually stained in kennedy s blood as shown in this color image next is the notation ragged slanted x mm the arrow is clearly pointing upwards indicating a proposed upwards trajectory a summarized autopsy conclusion by fbi agent autopsy witnesses james sibert and francis x o neill in a am teletype freshly written after departing the autopsy around pm am and driving to the fbi lab from bethesda naval hospital reads gt total body xray and autopsy revealed one bullet entered back of head and thereafter emerged through top of skull piece of skull measuring ten by six point five centimeters later flown in from dallas hospital and xrays bethesda disclosed minute metal fragments in this piece where bullet emerged from skull even the autopsy report with it s above and behind line has a sentence describing the small head wound as being in the occiput while the large head wound as being in the vertex which is supposed to have a beveled exit on part the skull bone gt upon reflecting the scalp multiple complete fracture lines are seen to radiate from both the large defect at the vertex and the smaller wound at the occiput by definition the occiput is lower than the vertex the sea of documentary and witness evidence unanimously indicates that this small entrance head wound could not have been higher than slightly above the external occipital protuberance on the same page the official autopsy report reads gt situated in the posterior scalp approximately cm laterally to the right and slightly above the external occipital protuberance in the underlying bone is a corresponding wound through the skull which exhibits beveling of the margins of the bone when viewed from the inner aspect of the skull this report was based on notes taken at the autopsy which were later destroyed the beveling of the bone was reportedly identified by forensic pathologist dr pierre finck who was called late to the autopsy to assist autopsy surgeons dr humes and dr j thornton boswell who were inexperienced in gunshot wound cases all evidence provided by humes wc hsca hsca livingstone jama aguilar arrb boswell wc hsca hsca livingstone jama aguilar arrb and finck wc blumberg amp clark panel clay shaw hsca hsca arrb indicate that this wound was right next to the external occipital protuberance and that only an approximation was needed to describe how close it was drs humes boswell and finck have never deviated from their reporting on this while being interviewed through the years see this model skull marked by drs humes boswell and finck during the late s house select committee on assassinations investigation the lower marks are where they recalled the location of the small head wound the upper mark is where an entry wound closer in line with the depository would be located not only the three lead autopsy surgeons but other autopsy witnesses including photographer john stringer hsca lifton arrb arrb secret service agent roy kellerman wc hsca chief petty officer dr chester boyers hsca fbi agent francis x o neill hsca lieutenant richard lipsey hsca have made statements describing a small wound next to the eop two more autopsy participants may be considered half eop witnesses embalmer tom robinson who described seeing the autopsy pathologists use a tool to probe the base of the head hsca arrb and dr george burkley kennedy s personal physician who was present more info on burkley is further down the single assassin theory cannot account for the existence of this wound factoring in kennedy s body position at zapruder frame a carcano round from the angle of the sixth floor of the school book depository entering the skull next to the eop would exit the face area where no signifigant wound was reported or filmed not the top of the head as the official x rays and photographs indicate the large defect was located not just the right parietal bone see this diagram on z in an otherwise awful recent propaganda history channel special called tracking oswald some valuable experimental evidence was provided in the form of round fired from the angle of the sixth floor into a ballistics dummy next to it s eop location the bullet exited the face as shown on slow motion video a straight line would also continue in the direction of connally who suffered no applicable shrapnel wounds it would also fail to explain the damage to the windshield dashboard and the james tague curbstone which have all officially explained by fragments from the z head shot even if such a powerful round could suddenly deflect upwards upon entering skull how could it do so without severely damaging the cerebellum the official brain photographs show only slight damage to the right cerebellum how could it do so without depositing bullet fragments in the base of the head the official x rays only show fragments on the top of the head this small wound in the back of the head was right beside the eop not whatever measurement suits the single assassin theory the evidence overwhelmingly contradicts the u s government s official clark panel and house select committee on assassinations conclusion that the small wound reported at autopsy was actually inches above the eop in the parietal bone close to the large defect in the same bone the clark panel consisted of doctors and the hsca medical panel consisted of doctors they concluded that the pathologists who performed the autopsy made a inch mistake mistook the occipital bone for the parietal bone and that the rest of the autopsy participants also mistook the base of the head for the top of the head here is an official sketch of the situation proposed by the house select committee on assassinations investigation which for all intents and purposes is considered the current official story photographs as well as x rays of the body were taken at the autopsy there are no photographs which show an unambiguous view of the small head wound described in the autopsy report kennedy s hair was not shaved to give a clearer view of the wounds and the area on the back of the scalp reported to contain the small entrance head wound is not shown in a clear enough view to differentiate his hair from possible wounds there are a lot of statements from the autopsy pathologists and photographer john stringer that close up views of the small head wound were taken which do not appear on the official collection of photographs missing autopsy photographs is another big subject the record is littered with statements indicating that various views of the body photographed at the autopsy including close ups of the small wound in the back of the scalp and the inner and outer surface of the skull upon reflection have gone missing from the record there is some evidence that robert f kennedy wanted to personally take or destroy john s preserved brain and tissue samples but not the photographs here are some leaked versions of the official autopsy photographs back of the scalp with ruler next to red belmish if you scroll down this page you will find some high quality morphing animations of the back of head photos the current official theory is that the red blemish to the right of the ruler was the actual entry wound described in the autopsy report this is also referred to as the cowlick wound the head is tilted considerably back and the scalp appears to be considerably loose so there is actually no proof that this spot could correspond with any particular hole in the skull bone no hole in the skull bone under the scalp has been reported to be visible on the high quality official versions of these photographs as researcher pat speer points out the red blemish only appears to be about millimeters not the elliptical x millimeters noted on the autopsy report if you read through the statements of humes boswell finck and stringer among some others you will see just how strongly the autopsy pathologists disagreed with this interpretation zero individuals at the autopsy recognized the red blemish as any significant wound humes finck and autopsy photographer john stringer suggested that the red blemish was just clotted blood boswell on the other hand told both the hsca and the arrb that he believed it was a small cut in the scalp related to the large defect the three pathologists and photographer argued that the existing photographs didn t show the back of the scalp clearly enough or that this white spot below the ruler may represent the wound the photographs of the wound in the back also give a confusing view of the back of the scalp it may have helped if we had the high quality official collection instead of leaked versions note how the hair is parted differently than it is in the other photographs is the grey teardrop shape with a hair growing out of it the same red blemish from the other ones also note how the white spot is still visible this white spot appears to be slightly below the eop but it remains an enigma despite not correlating with the autopsy report s slightly above the eop the hsca literally tried coercing dr humes into verbally agreeing with their upper entry wound interpretation of the back of head photographs anybody who hears the tape or reads the transcript of their joint interview with humes and boswell heard them almost literally arguing with them about the location of the small head wound but it gets worse hsca counselor gary cornwell admitted in his book real answers that he threatened to treat humes as a hostile witness if he did not concede to their theory and that in his opinion the autopsy pathologists were lying about the wound to hide their personal embarrassment of describing it in their report as an approximation instead of a specific measurement also according to former hsca medical panel members andy purdy and michael baden fellow panel member dr charles petty verbally berated humes after he and dr boswell openly disagreed with the panel about their interpretation of the red blemish as an entry wound in a taped interview according to author david lifton who visited the hsca public hearings in person humes fists were literally shaking in anger while walking out of the building from his final testimony to the hsca the hsca medical panel seemed obsessed with their theory of a higher wound to explain a trajectory from the school book depository humes nor anybody never truly deviated from his opinion about the location of the small head wound zero individuals who were with the body ever agreed with the clark panel and hsca over where if any small head wound was located everybody who was there is now dead or dying so the roughly corroborating statements from these ten autopsy wound witnesses is forever solidified in time and nothing can ever falsify it the clark panel and hsca also contended that the skull x rays show a small hole cm above the eop the x rays from the autopsy were taken with low resolution portable ww era x ray equipment for the sole purpose of scanning for bullets or large bullet fragments in the body not for the purpose of recording the forensic evidence of the wounds themselves it would appear that the expert consensus on the existence of a hole on these x rays is also questionable an equal number of people equally experienced in x rays have examined the official films and couldn t identify any specific defect resembling an entry wound dr john ebersole dr fred hodges dr robert mcmeekin dr alfred olivier dr norman chase dr g m mcdonnel dr david o davis dr douglas ubelaker dr john j fitzpatrick dr robert kirschner dr david mantik and dr peter cummings photographs were also taken of the skull with the scalp peeled back but just as there are debates over the x rays and pictures of the skin the pictures of the skull are most likely the most confusing and debated images in history the debate exists even with those that have seen the high quality official collection here is an album of some high quality leaked versions the hsca also formulated a basic interpretation of the skull photographs the open cranium photographs are known to be one of the most confusing photographs in crime case history opinions vary on whether the front or the back of the skull is in the foreground on these photographs color versions of which are stored at the national archives building no color versions have leaked here is an album explaining the hsca s interpretation of these photos very few question the proposed outward beveling location because it appears to be a textbook example of beveling on the edge of a bullet wound in the bone but the presence of an an inward beveled hole indicating entry behind it is questionable as neuropathologist joe riley has pointed out the hsca medical panel s interpretation of the open cranium photographs is anatomically impossible because it necessitates this brain to fit through a five inch skull cavity the only way their interpretation of these photos could come close to being true is if the autopsy pathologists somehow repaired the back of the skull or placed skull fragments back in after removing the brain but prior to taking the photographs usually in an autopsy the entire top of the skull is separated with a saw in order to remove the brain in some cases the brain can be removed without separating any of the occipital bone if it is carefully lifted and maneuvered through the front of the head but in those cases a lot of frontal bone is separated and enough of the left side of the skull is separated to fit your fingers under the left temporal lobe in the case of the open cranium photographs not only did the hsca conclude that the photos showed the frontal bone mostly intact their proposed beveled exit location is near the coronal suture but also either way you orient them anatomically they still show a lot of the left side of the skull intact some who examined the photographs expressed belief that the beveled exit wound existed lower on the forehead above the right eyebrow and in that interpretation a lot of frontal bone would be missing from the open cranium but if so the doctors never reported this wound which would have had to be obvious at the autopsy by the way the autopsy pathologists were shown the cranium photographs and couldn t recognize the beveled exit on the edge of the skull bone remember from above the autopsy pathologsts only ever reported identifying exit beveling on the edge of a skull fragment that s just one of those gigantic contradictions we re expected to accept i took this model skull and drew an outline representing the absolute maximum size skull cavity that could exist while still being consistent with the official hsca interpretation of the autopsy skull photographs clearly this is too small to lift or even rotate the official gram brain through removing a brain requires enough space to fit your hands underneath the brain these issues with the official inches above the eop interpretation of these photographs is compounded by the fact that the earliest evidence from the autopsy indicates that the pathologists thought the beveled exit in the skull was anatomically higher than the small head wound are the single assassin theorists going to ignore that too dr pierre finck has consistently stated that he arrived late to the autopsy after the top of the skull had already been opened up to facilitate the removal of the brain and yet he could still examine this small wound as an undisturbed perforation in the occipital bone again more indication that this hole was low in the head if there was an entry wound inches above the eop then the hole in the skull would have been among the portions of skull separated during the brain removal procedure some have argued that the hsca s interpretation of the photographs and finck s statements could be true if humes and boswell had just carefully sawed around this entry hole in the parietal bone this explanation cannot be true because the autopsy pathologists have already explained how fractured and brittle the area of skull around the large defect was and how virtually no sawing of the skull was necessary to create a skull cavity large enough to remove the brain some statements from the autopsy pathologists also indicate that just the scalp incision made for separating the top of the skull was not enough to expose the outer surface of the reported small hole in the skull and that a special incision lower in the scalp was required to expose it on a finishing note dr burkley suspected or believed that kennedy may have been struck in the head by more than one missile dr george burkley rode in the back of the motorcade in dallas on call at all times in case of medical emergency he briefly viewed kennedy s body in the emergency room at dallas flew on air force one to maryland and worked as a messenger between the autopsy pathologists and the kennedy family who stayed at the hospital until the body was restored for casket viewing burkley wrote his signature verifying the face sheet diagram of kennedy s wounds as well as the official autopsy report produced a few days later despite apparently feeling as if he had enough authority over the matter to sign the body sheet and autopsy report was not called by the warren commission to testify about his experience beginning at the motorcade at the dallas emergency room in maryland for the autopsy etc he only wrote a death certificate and a affidavit which no not mention any specific evidence about the head wounds except the fact that they were fatal he was interviewed by william manchester for his book the killing of a president but the only passage that could be relevant to forensic evidence is the lincoln continues to slow down its interior is a place of horror the last bullet has torn through john kennedy s cerebellum the lower part of his brain then in a interview at the jfk library burkley stated my conclusion in regard to the cause of death was the bullet wound which involved the skull the discussion as to whether a previous bullet also enters into it but as far as the cause of death the immediate cause was unquestionably the bullet which shattered the brain and the calvarium and when asked do you agree with the warren report on the number of bullets that entered the president s body he replied i would not care to be quoted on that the interviewer mentioned nothing of a discussion of whether a previous bullet entered into it burkley brought it up independently around the multiple shooter conspiracy theories mainly focused on arguing against the single bullet theory rather than arguing against the official story of a single gunshot to the back of the head so there is no sign of where burkley got this more than one bullet to the head idea years later a letter from dr burkley s attorney was sent to the hsca said he has information in the kennedy assassination indicating that others besides oswald must have participated and that burkley would be available to interview an august interview report written by dr purdy of the hsca medical panel reads dr burkley said the doctors didn t section the brain and that if it had been done it might be possible to prove whether or not there were two bullets dr burkley thinks there was one but concedes the possibility of there having been two burkley then gave a affidavit to the hsca only saying had the warren commission deemed to call me i would have stated why i retained the brain and the possibility of two bullets having wounded president john f kennedy s brain would have been eliminated i supervised the autopsy and directed the fixation and retention of the brain for future study of the course of the bullet or bullets and finally author henry hurt interviewed burkley in reasonable doubt page gt it is significant that dr burkley had been with the president in dallas with him in the parkland hospital emergency room with his body as it was flown east and present during the autopsy it is also significant that even though he was the only doctor present both at parkland and at bethesda dr burkley s testimony was never taken by the warren commission nor was it taken later by the house select committee gt in dr burkley told the author in a telephone conversation that he believed that president kennedy s assassination was the result of a conspiracy gt this startling statement after so long a silence amplified an obscure exchange dr burkley had in an oral history interview on file at the kennedy library in boston gt when he originally telephoned the author dr burkley expressed his willingness to discuss various matters concerning the assassination he asked for a letter detailing the areas the author wished to discuss dr burkley acknowledged receipt of the letter with a letter of his own two months later the author proposed a meeting with dr burkley to discuss the points the doctor responded with an abrupt refusal to discuss any aspect of the case can t explain the eop wound without a conspiracy many researchers suspect that the x rays have been faked and that the brain in the official photograph collection did not belong to kennedy but a conspiracy can be argued without invoking the fabrication of evidence different vantage points for a shooter different weapons different ammunition and different outlets for missiles striking kennedy s body should be open for consideration for all reasonable people whatever few explanations there are all of kennedy s head wounds cannot be explained by a single round fired from the depository even in a hypothetical scenario where an upper entry wound could be proven to exist on the x rays it would still have to coexist with the evidence for a lower wound the eop wound evidence is simply too credible to just retcon it out of existence to promote a simpler shooting scenario

41183,with the joe rogan board being shut down and all the posts being deleted i decided to repost this op from because it was one of favorite and i don t think it should be lost forever the name of the poster who wrote all this got lost so if anyone remembers let me know all i ll update the op this might be the craziest bath salt story you ever read warning long post the story begins when a man named john mcaffee goes to college gets a degree and launches a handful of successful technology startup companies in the early s when the market was hot one of those companies mcaffee anti virus eventually sells for roughly million dollars and he is set for life he then invents a new sport which mostly involved rich white guys with way too much money and time on their hands flying high speed experimental aircraft very close to the ground not surprisingly one of these old white rich guys dies doing this and the family decides to sue john for million dollars john sells all of his us assets and moves to belize where they coincidentally do not recognize us law and anyone seeking any sort of compensation from john as a result of any us ruling will probably never see that money also the age of consent in belize is so he wastes no time in shacking up with a girl years younger than him so far this is all a fairly normal white guy problems story but this is where it gets weird apparently while in belize john discovers something called methylenedioxypyrovalerone mdpv which happens to be the active ingredient in what is now commonly known as bath salts and he likes it sadly though at some point the market shifts and the quality of commercially available mdpv deteriorates so john sets out to make his own high grade mdpv that s right he begins freebasing bath salts the same shit that makes people eat your face off he starts making the crack version of it in his quest to make the ultimate face eating zombie powder he begins posting on a drug forum asking for tips and advice gt hello everyone i ve been lurking here for years and just recently decided to join up i m hoping to get some help here gt i m a huge fan of mdpv not the white hydrochloride it s inconceivable that anyone on the planet would willingly put that into their bodies i m talking the freebase form i think many of you that don t bother to freebase it yourself have at least tasted the freebase version when it was widely available as tan mdpv i think it s the finest drug evere conceived not just for the indescribable hypersexuality but also for the smooth euphoria and mild comedown gt my question is this how can i more easilly separate the oil from the precipitate using some mechanical means gt here s the nightmarish process i ve been going through so far gt first i precipitate and then place the container on a foot vibrator for minutes to raise the first oil the oil is heavier than water by the way gt gt then i painstakingly touch each droplet with the point of a hyperdermic which causes the oil to climb up the needle then i slowly extract the needle until the surface tension at the top allows the oil to float gt gt i can only do a small amount at a time or else the oil collects into a ball large enough to sink again i draw off the oil with a filed down needle point and then spend another mitues of vibrating until the next batch rises as i proceed the droplets become smaller and smaller until they are barely visible the complete extraction takes to hours gt for anyone who freebases mdpv by the way the oil is dangerous beyond belief when i first started doing this i accidently got a few drops on my fingers while handling a used flask and didn t sleep for days i had visual and auditory hallucinations and the worst paranoia of my life it s all the bad aspects of white mdpv times a hundred if you think the comedown from the white mdpv is bad rub this oil into your skin you ll be begging for a hundred milligram dose of the white in exchange use rubber gloves gt anyway can someone tell me how i can mechanically separate the oil from the precipitate in less than hours i definitaely don t want to use a reagent i m not a chemist or any kind of scientist by the way just someone who refused to accept the new mdpv gt thank you you see somewhere along the way while john was trying to freebase bath salts he seems to have stumbled across an entirely new drug at least that s what he thinks every chemist and chemical company tells him what he has is still just plain old mdpv and that s not surprising considering all he is doing is concentrating it but he is convinced his freebase is still somehow diifferent like the alchemists of old he has magically transmuted the properties of the mundane to the truly divine and by divine i mean after ingesting just mg of his magical bath salt zombie crack he and his year old girlfriend had wild untamed monkey sex for straight hours naturally members of the forum are skeptical that he has found the holy grail of bath salts especially considering john freely admits that his freebase method is a bit sloppy rudimentary very time consuming and rarely produces the desired drug hence his coming to the forum and asking for advice in the first place gt if you do try it here is what happens the white hcl is on the right the precipitate left out for hours in water and air is on the left the precipitate after hours is in the middle it continues to degrade all the way through dark brown over the course of a week the color in the center is what you re looking for in terms of best characteristics when dried it remains stable gt gt note the above posts are simply freebasing instructions for the hcl form of mdpv to my knowledge there is no synthesis involved or transformation into any chemical other than mdpv gt p s do not touch the oil extremely dangerous and never take more than mg of the tan colored form at one time the good news is when you are a millionaire living in belize freebasing bath salts you have plenty of time on your hands to make more bath salt crack to freebase with your year old girlfriend and post about it on the internet gt i just tried it with ml of water mg of pv mg of soda and no heating and you can see the oil residue on the sides of the beaker so ml and cold solution should be no problem although to fully recover your pv you do have to heat it i didn t wait for the powder to fully precipitate before i took the pic you can see it just starting to form the slightly darker thin layer on the bottom just wanted to see if the oil was produced and precipitate would begin gt gt i can only assume that your pv is something other than pv gt if you do get it right here s what it should look like after hours of evaporation i scraped the lower half for drying for the next pic gt gt here s the lower half after drying and before grinding back into a powder gt gt after hours of evaporation you get the following it s still very good but not as good as the previous color gt gt both of the above colored forms are highly potent don t eyeball dosage if you re used to the white pv you will certainly overdose on this stuff because it is three times heavier by volume than the white stuff if you achieve a color similar to the first one above then it s potency is hard to overstate always weigh it and never do more than mg at a time mg of this is not much larger than a pinhead gt a side note heat is required to begin the transformation for example if you don t heat the solution at all during precipitation you will be left with a light yellow substance that has exactly the same poor characteristics of white mdpv if you don t provide enough heat the same thing will happen you ll know when not enough heat has been applied because after hours of evaporation your mix will have a light greenish yellow cast with no orange tint there will be no tan hue it will look like this gt gt if the oil has a nice egg yolk color to it then the heating has been perfect gt gt if the yellow green color happens don t worry you haven t lost anything add water pour it back in the flask and heat slowly as described in an earlier post two saucepans for a couple of hours redo everything and the tan mdpv will appear gt there are dozens of things that can go wrong during this process none of them irreversible and there are a few possible end products that might look like the tan but aren t overheating the solution for example produces something after evaporation and drying that looks exactly like tan mdpv but merely gives massive incapacitating headaches when bumped no euphoria no high no hypersexuality if you run into problems i ll be happy to help meanwhile rumors begin circulating around belize that the eccentric millionaire who lives in their neck of the woods is becoming increasingly eccentric he spends days on end and all hours of the night hidden away in his jungle compound with a small harem of teenage girls just what the hell is he doing in there gt i ve processed kilos of this stuff in the past year or so and bump it myself every day in fair quantities the hypersexuality is beyond belief i have had a number of acquaintances both male and female who have rubbed their genitals way past the point of bleeding and still couldn t stop gt in all honesty a first time user or a user on a large dose when presented with food will simply figure out a way to include it in the ongoing sex play with their partner if alone they will figure out a way to fuck it or shove it up their rectum this is not a joke everything on the tan becomes a sex partner or a sex aid if only visually i will not anymore let anyone on tan be alone with my dogs for example i have dogs twice in the past year tan users one man one woman both after major massive doses to be fair attempted to have sex with one of my dogs one user again after a hugely massive dose was arrested in a local village here for publicly molesting strangers fortunately in my country such a crime is punishable by a small fine at worst so perhaps the appetite suppression that initially comes on is really an appetite disinterest water though dehydration is a major danger throughout force yourself to hydrate when on the tan it s way worse than mdma especially in higher doses in terms of suppressing thirst watch your urine if it gets darker stop what your doing and drink water gt over the past two years i have played with mdpv using ether tuloene xylene baking soda galacial acetate vinegar water ethanol and dirt from my garden the bacterial connection i have precipitated heated frozen incubated dissolved evaporated combined and separated every possible combination of precipitate solution and oil in the process i have come up with substances that were less than enjoyable to ingest i am my only test subject for these experiments i temporarily blinded myself for three hours after drying and ingesting a brown goo that appeared after five days of incubating an odd gray precipitate after an ether acetate experiment with pv i once ended up with a dark brown substance that looked similar to the darker tan pv versions it gave me an incapacitating headache that lasted days i had overheated the pv oil during precipitation and created something horrible i got pv oil on my skin and didn t sleep for hours during which time hellish visual and auditory hallucinations had me locked in the bathroom where i hid in the bathtub for hours my first hit of the acetate salt that i created from the tan had me hallucinating again for a few days i had not considered that the salt version of the tan freebase might have dosages measured in micrograms i should have guessed from the huge residual slush left over from the acetic acid wash but i didn t i bumped milligrams micrograms is a large dose gt what i m saying is that my body is barely being held together and what little cohesion is left is the result of vitamins and pure will power so i just don t have the courage to go down the acetate road the hcl road has used me up gt you should have seen some of my forum posts on other boards when i was overdosing on pv holy shit this dude claims to have discovered a psycho sexual drug so potent you will rub your dick into a bloody stump after rage fucking the family dog after just one bump what do you do when you are a millionaire living in a third world country who has discovered a means to produce the ultimate sex drug and you have a harem of year old girls addicted to it buy better lab equipment and start passing the shit out like candy gt and this might be the place to talk about pure tan my first post in this thread alluded to the process and visually showed some of the procedures i purposely obfuscated a little because well i did a lot of work to figure out how to make it pure and it s not really necessary for the average user anyway the quick and dirty which anyone can do is well explained above and produces imho the finest chemical ever to appear on this planet i m a perfectionist however and spent the better part of this past year honing a purification procedure i won t talk about how to do because it wouldn t be germane to the average kitchen cook it requires among other unwieldy implements a rotovap gt gt an airclean system gt gt a reasonably powerful microscope that will connect to a computer so you can do detailed microscopic measurements and an incubator gt gt it s not a fun process five consecutive full hour workdays will produce only this gt gt a one milligram dose of this whatever this is is scary a mg dose unchaperoned would be unquestionable fatal or at least massively harmful mostly from the uncontrollable insanity it would bring into your life keep in mind that the end product of the quick and dirty approach that i outlined contains less than of this substance precipitate unavoidable loss through evaporation mdpv contamination etc so a mg dose of the quick and dirty is a good time a mg dose of the pure would be a time you would never forget and probably never want to repeat gt what i do here with my friends and acquaintances who rightly worship this stuff is mix it to with ground up excedrin and wrap it in mg doses gt gt why excedrin first large doses of the tan is socially harmful at the least and people are people they don t use the best judgment sometimes powdered excedrin bumped or plugged in doses of more than mg in a single day will cause massive pain bleeding and discomfort it is a deterrent to crossing the line into extreme danger second daily use of the tan causes a a slight background headache for some users after a few days me included mg of excedrin powder bumped removes it entirely but since people are people a number of folks have figured out how to remove the excedrin by mixing the batch in a large quantity of water the excedrin remains in suspension for or minutes the pure tan falls to the bottom almost immediately they siphon off the suspension and are left with an extremely dangerous substance dangerous because it is utterly impossible to measure a safe dosage of the pure substance without possessing a scale costing thousands of dollars there have already been harmful events with people who have purified my excedrin mix gt a local brothel owner prostitution is legal in my country talked me out of a large amount of tan and provides it to his working girls and their customers the idea was to simply increase business by having hornier customers and more authentic product it worked for a while and then girls started taking larger doses and giving customers larger doses they began leaving and running off with customers some after a single contact with the customer two of these men were married had good jobs and children that they loved it has to be obvious even to the most casual observer that this is massively disruptive and borders on insanity gt if a person takes a large dose of the tan and has the misfortune to have no partner at the time then truly terrible things happen a number of men and women have molested strangers after massive doses of the pure product which is why i no longer provide it to anyone other than trusted friends everything else is cut to one twice users on large doses have tried to molest my dogs again even the most casual observer will see the danger in this gt i have distributed over doses exclusively in this country they call it spt i named it and it is a seriously hot underground topic here i know of at least a dozen people who spend virtually full time playing with this and hundreds trying to get samples which i dole out with meticulous care anyone caught sharing this with another without my consent doesn t get any more now in case you think our man is simply obsessed with the singular pursuit of his tan his name for the his special mdpv crack you should know he is open to all avenues of exploration as evidenced by the following photos he shared with his new drug forum friends gt tan is not the only thing that has come out of mdpv and i am not the only person producing stuff i try to keep track of all the recreational products on the world market looking for constituents that provide evidence that other people are walking down this same path gt gt it also contains trace amounts of a salvia divinorum based product i ve been playing around myself with combining tiny amounts of salvia based chemicals with the tan hugely awesome but i can t get a dosage that works for everyone yet gt for those of you who have tried salvia you will recognize the leaves below the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogen gt gt salvinorin a the active ingredient in salvia when processed correctly yields a hypersexual compound that surpasses the tan if you can even get mind around the concept but its side effects for even a tiny overdose are debilitating uncontrollable shaking frothing at the mouth which oddly doesn t detract from its sexual appeal if both partners are on it so minimal doses are required and the effects of these small doses are additive when combined with the tan the salvia based chemical in this bolivian brew is different from the one i use but very close i ve been trying to figure out how they made it so what to do after you ve exposed yourself on the internet as a rich third world drug fiend sex addict simple post everything about yourself short of your social security number before the drugs wear off gt i suppose it s time i should introduce myself gt my name is john and my main focus is the effect of medicinal tropical plants on bacteria and vice versa i don t need to tell you my exact location because it doesn t really matter imagine there s no country as another john once said gt to do any decent research in this field i had to be near tropical plants jungles have tropical plants so i moved to this place gt gt until supplies could arrive after which i built the lab gt gt and stocked it with stuff that i would need in order to do research gt gt gt gt gt gt then i went about the task of bringing some small civilization into the heart of darkness gt gt but of course after a three day bender freebasing bath salts and fucking your teenage harem girls the paranoia finally sets in gt ok so i did what i came here to do i ve had fun and i hope i ve given some of you food for thought but i have to get back to the real world the on line world is more of a distraction than the self induced effects of the many experiments i ve done using my own body over the past year or so and i have work to do gt i m going to delete all of my posts in this thread i m afraid that unless i can answer questions for people the information will be more confusing than helpful i myself won t have the time to log back on here i may lurk again from time to time though two days should be enough time for those of you in the middle of making quick tan to ask your questions and get your answers those of you i ve given my email to in private messages that email address won t be valid in a couple of days those to whom i gave my phone number same thing gt so ask what you need if anything before i move on not trying to be dramatic i just can t spare any more time away from the work i ve been on a semi sebatical since i started this thread gt you are a good bunch of people however a few more bumps of the zombie sex crack and john is back with gusto describing his sexcapades with teenage girls under the influence of his mystery drugs gt impossible to stay away from this thread the dance is seductive it is entirely possible i believe to break every known sexual taboo and indulge in activities that many would describe as monstrously depraved with the one that you love and have both partners feel elevated by the experience but then john disappears again with one last cryptic post gt i have photos of the boss fucking dogs in my safe at home i think my job is secure where did john disappear to well perhaps not surprisingly after admitting on a public forum that you are experimenting with powerful hallucinogenic sex drugs in your home lab with teenage girls and then passing this stuff out to thousands of people the cops are going to be a tad bit interested even if it is a third world country and you are worth millions of dollars so on may nd of this year the gsu gang suppression unit raided john s home during the raid they found a cache of firearms and a year old girl along with piles of cash and large quantities of mystery powders he was charged with running a meth lab after so many locals had reported the effects of this crazy drug that he was manufacturing and distributing of course the catch is mdpv is perfectly legal in belize and therefore so is whatever the fuck he is making with it until it can be identified so they let him go now anyone who has had any experience with meth speed mdpv and the long sleepless binges that usually follow suit can tell you one of the unfortunate side effects is massive paranoia after prolonged use even john admitted he was not immune to this in fact many reporters who spoke to john around the time he was posting his research spoke of his increasingly bizarre and paranoid behavior i would imagine having the gang suppression unit kick in your doors with ak s would probably not do much to alleviate that paranoia either which is why i was only partially surprised to read today that john mcaffee is now wanted for questioning in the murder of his neighbor gregory faull apparently faull was annoyed by the constant barking of mcaffee s dogs who lived just yards away and were presumably very loud sex partners so he filed a complaint with the local police when that failed to produce results however faull took matters into his own hands and began poisoning the dogs the day after the dogs were found dead faull was found in a pool of blood with a bullet in his head and now john mcaffee is on the run reportedly afraid that the police will kill him

41506,hey thought i d copypasta a previous r conspiracy post i made with some minor changes the official autopsy report for jfk written days after his death and mortuary examination reads gt the projectiles were fired from a point behind and somewhat above the level of the deceased the report was written by dr james humes of bethesda naval hospital the lead autopsy surgeon who handled kennedy s body after it was flown to bethesda maryland from dallas texas the autopsy report was partially based on notes handwritten during the body examination including measurements the above and behind official party line was elaborated on by humes in his warren commission testimony gt mr specter what conclusions did you reach then as to the trajectory or point of origin of the bullet dr humes based on gt commander humes we reached the conclusion that this missile was fired toward the president from a point above and behind him sir arlen specter was referring to commission exhibit also see commission exhibit these drawings were made by a medical illustrator working by the recollections of the autopsy pathologists but it is certainly apparent by those illustrations that the small proposed entrance in the back of the head is anatomically lower than the exit location since kennedy s brain was not properly sectioned and photographed to determine the path of the missile s the reported holes and beveling identified in the skull bone is provided as the only proof that the the head wounds were created by a single shot from behind the above in above and behind could only only justified by the flawed assumption that kennedy s head was sharply forward at the moment of impact which is drawn in ce and that cannot be true during humes testimony allen dulles of the cia expresses puzzlement over the steep upwards angle through the head proposed in the ce and drawings humes then admits that since the reconstruction of the skull during the autopsy was incomplete and therefore point of exit could have been a little lower than the ce and drawings depict according to humes the point of exit was determined at the autopsy when a large piece of skull bone allegedly found on the floor of the limousine was later flown in from dallas and this fragment had an area of exit beveling of the edge of it in other words they could not prove that this point of exit was ever a through and through bullet hole in cases of a tangential wound a bullet could just clip the skull from the side and leave a streak of exit beveling instead of a through and through entrance and exit hole so proving a whole exit hole was not done by dr pierre finck the forensic pathologist at the autopsy assisting humes who identified the beveling this fragment was right parietal bone here s an x ray taken of this skull fragment at the autopsy before it was allegedly placed back onto the head for the later cosmetic reconstruction and buried with the rest of the body the right parietal bone is anatomically higher than the location of the small wound where the pathologists reported a missile entered way higher ce tilted to match the zapruer frame z establishing that the autopsy pathologist s proposed entrance location in the head was anatomically lower than their proposed exit location on the top right side of the head on the night of the autopsy the pathologists sure weren t thinking above and behind we have information from the night of the autopsy showing that the location of this beveled exit on the skull bone was anatomically higher than the small head wound autopsy face sheet diagram marked during the body examination showing a dot indicating the small head wound in the back of the head this document is actually stained in kennedy s blood as shown in this color image next is the notation ragged slanted x mm the arrow is clearly pointing upwards indicating a proposed upwards trajectory a summarized autopsy conclusion by fbi agent autopsy witnesses james sibert and francis x o neill in a am teletype freshly written after departing the autopsy around pm am and driving to the fbi lab from bethesda naval hospital reads gt total body xray and autopsy revealed one bullet entered back of head and thereafter emerged through top of skull piece of skull measuring ten by six point five centimeters later flown in from dallas hospital and xrays bethesda disclosed minute metal fragments in this piece where bullet emerged from skull even the autopsy report with it s above and behind line has a sentence describing the small head wound as being in the occiput while the large head wound as being in the vertex which is supposed to have a beveled exit on part the skull bone gt upon reflecting the scalp multiple complete fracture lines are seen to radiate from both the large defect at the vertex and the smaller wound at the occiput by definition the occiput is lower than the vertex the sea of documentary and witness evidence unanimously indicates that this small entrance head wound could not have been higher than slightly above the external occipital protuberance on the same page the official autopsy report reads gt situated in the posterior scalp approximately cm laterally to the right and slightly above the external occipital protuberance in the underlying bone is a corresponding wound through the skull which exhibits beveling of the margins of the bone when viewed from the inner aspect of the skull this report was based on notes taken at the autopsy which were later destroyed the beveling of the bone was reportedly identified by forensic pathologist dr pierre finck who was called late to the autopsy to assist autopsy surgeons dr humes and dr j thornton boswell who were inexperienced in gunshot wound cases all evidence provided by humes wc hsca hsca livingstone jama aguilar arrb boswell wc hsca hsca livingstone jama aguilar arrb and finck wc blumberg amp clark panel clay shaw hsca hsca arrb indicate that this wound was right next to the external occipital protuberance and that only an approximation was needed to describe how close it was drs humes boswell and finck have never deviated from their reporting on this while being interviewed through the years see this model skull marked by drs humes boswell and finck during the late s house select committee on assassinations investigation the lower marks are where they recalled the location of the small head wound the upper mark is where an entry wound closer in line with the depository would be located not only the three lead autopsy surgeons but other autopsy witnesses including photographer john stringer hsca lifton arrb arrb secret service agent roy kellerman wc hsca chief petty officer dr chester boyers hsca fbi agent francis x o neill hsca lieutenant richard lipsey hsca have made statements describing a small wound next to the eop two more autopsy participants may be considered half eop witnesses embalmer tom robinson who described seeing the autopsy pathologists use a tool to probe the base of the head hsca arrb and dr george burkley kennedy s personal physician who was present more info on burkley is further down the single assassin theory cannot account for the existence of this wound factoring in kennedy s body position at zapruder frame a carcano round from the angle of the sixth floor of the school book depository entering the skull next to the eop would exit the face area where no signifigant wound was reported or filmed not the top of the head as the official x rays and photographs indicate the large defect was located not just the right parietal bone see this diagram on z in an otherwise awful recent propaganda history channel special called tracking oswald some valuable experimental evidence was provided in the form of round fired from the angle of the sixth floor into a ballistics dummy next to it s eop location the bullet exited the face as shown on slow motion video a straight line would also continue in the direction of connally who suffered no applicable shrapnel wounds it would also fail to explain the damage to the windshield dashboard and the james tague curbstone which have all officially explained by fragments from the z head shot even if such a powerful round could suddenly deflect upwards upon entering skull how could it do so without severely damaging the cerebellum the official brain photographs show only slight damage to the right cerebellum how could it do so without depositing bullet fragments in the base of the head the official x rays only show fragments on the top of the head this small wound in the back of the head was right beside the eop not whatever measurement suits the single assassin theory the evidence overwhelmingly contradicts the u s government s official clark panel and house select committee on assassinations conclusion that the small wound reported at autopsy was actually inches above the eop in the parietal bone close to the large defect in the same bone the clark panel consisted of doctors and the hsca medical panel consisted of doctors they concluded that the pathologists who performed the autopsy made a inch mistake mistook the occipital bone for the parietal bone and that the rest of the autopsy participants also mistook the base of the head for the top of the head here is an official sketch of the situation proposed by the house select committee on assassinations investigation which for all intents and purposes is considered the current official story photographs as well as x rays of the body were taken at the autopsy there are no photographs which show an unambiguous view of the small head wound described in the autopsy report kennedy s hair was not shaved to give a clearer view of the wounds and the area on the back of the scalp reported to contain the small entrance head wound is not shown in a clear enough view to differentiate his hair from possible wounds there are a lot of statements from the autopsy pathologists and photographer john stringer that close up views of the small head wound were taken which do not appear on the official collection of photographs missing autopsy photographs is another big subject the record is littered with statements indicating that various views of the body photographed at the autopsy including close ups of the small wound in the back of the scalp and the inner and outer surface of the skull upon reflection have gone missing from the record there is some evidence that robert f kennedy wanted to personally take or destroy john s preserved brain and tissue samples but not the photographs here are some leaked versions of the official autopsy photographs back of the scalp with ruler next to red belmish if you scroll down this page you will find some high quality morphing animations of the back of head photos the current official theory is that the red blemish to the right of the ruler was the actual entry wound described in the autopsy report this is also referred to as the cowlick wound the head is tilted considerably back and the scalp appears to be considerably loose so there is actually no proof that this spot could correspond with any particular hole in the skull bone no hole in the skull bone under the scalp has been reported to be visible on the high quality official versions of these photographs as researcher pat speer points out the red blemish only appears to be about millimeters not the elliptical x millimeters noted on the autopsy report if you read through the statements of humes boswell finck and stringer among some others you will see just how strongly the autopsy pathologists disagreed with this interpretation zero individuals at the autopsy recognized the red blemish as any significant wound humes finck and autopsy photographer john stringer suggested that the red blemish was just clotted blood boswell on the other hand told both the hsca and the arrb that he believed it was a small cut in the scalp related to the large defect the three pathologists and photographer argued that the existing photographs didn t show the back of the scalp clearly enough or that this white spot below the ruler may represent the wound the photographs of the wound in the back also give a confusing view of the back of the scalp it may have helped if we had the high quality official collection instead of leaked versions note how the hair is parted differently than it is in the other photographs is the grey teardrop shape with a hair growing out of it the same red blemish from the other ones also note how the white spot is still visible this white spot appears to be slightly below the eop but it remains an enigma despite not correlating with the autopsy report s slightly above the eop the hsca literally tried coercing dr humes into verbally agreeing with their upper entry wound interpretation of the back of head photographs anybody who hears the tape or reads the transcript of their joint interview with humes and boswell heard them almost literally arguing with them about the location of the small head wound but it gets worse hsca counselor gary cornwell admitted in his book real answers that he threatened to treat humes as a hostile witness if he did not concede to their theory and that in his opinion the autopsy pathologists were lying about the wound to hide their personal embarrassment of describing it in their report as an approximation instead of a specific measurement also according to former hsca medical panel members andy purdy and michael baden fellow panel member dr charles petty verbally berated humes after he and dr boswell openly disagreed with the panel about their interpretation of the red blemish as an entry wound in a taped interview according to author david lifton who visited the hsca public hearings in person humes fists were literally shaking in anger while walking out of the building from his final testimony to the hsca the hsca medical panel seemed obsessed with their theory of a higher wound to explain a trajectory from the school book depository humes nor anybody never truly deviated from his opinion about the location of the small head wound zero individuals who were with the body ever agreed with the clark panel and hsca over where if any small head wound was located everybody who was there is now dead or dying so the roughly corroborating statements from these ten autopsy wound witnesses is forever solidified in time and nothing can ever falsify it the clark panel and hsca also contended that the skull x rays show a small hole cm above the eop the x rays from the autopsy were taken with low resolution portable ww era x ray equipment for the sole purpose of scanning for bullets or large bullet fragments in the body not for the purpose of recording the forensic evidence of the wounds themselves it would appear that the expert consensus on the existence of a hole on these x rays is also questionable an equal number of people equally experienced in x rays have examined the official films and couldn t identify any specific defect resembling an entry wound dr john ebersole dr fred hodges dr robert mcmeekin dr alfred olivier dr norman chase dr g m mcdonnel dr david o davis dr douglas ubelaker dr john j fitzpatrick dr robert kirschner dr david mantik and dr peter cummings photographs were also taken of the skull with the scalp peeled back but just as there are debates over the x rays and pictures of the skin the pictures of the skull are most likely the most confusing and debated images in history the debate exists even with those that have seen the high quality official collection here is an album of some high quality leaked versions the hsca also formulated a basic interpretation of the skull photographs the open cranium photographs are known to be one of the most confusing photographs in crime case history opinions vary on whether the front or the back of the skull is in the foreground on these photographs color versions of which are stored at the national archives building no color versions have leaked here is an album explaining the hsca s interpretation of these photos very few question the proposed outward beveling location because it appears to be a textbook example of beveling on the edge of a bullet wound in the bone but the presence of an an inward beveled hole indicating entry behind it is questionable as neuropathologist joe riley has pointed out the hsca medical panel s interpretation of the open cranium photographs is anatomically impossible because it necessitates this brain to fit through a five inch skull cavity the only way their interpretation of these photos could come close to being true is if the autopsy pathologists somehow repaired the back of the skull or placed skull fragments back in after removing the brain but prior to taking the photographs usually in an autopsy the entire top of the skull is separated with a saw in order to remove the brain in some cases the brain can be removed without separating any of the occipital bone if it is carefully lifted and maneuvered through the front of the head but in those cases a lot of frontal bone is separated and enough of the left side of the skull is separated to fit your fingers under the left temporal lobe in the case of the open cranium photographs not only did the hsca conclude that the photos showed the frontal bone mostly intact their proposed beveled exit location is near the coronal suture but also either way you orient them anatomically they still show a lot of the left side of the skull intact some who examined the photographs expressed belief that the beveled exit wound existed lower on the forehead above the right eyebrow and in that interpretation a lot of frontal bone would be missing from the open cranium but if so the doctors never reported this wound which would have had to be obvious at the autopsy by the way the autopsy pathologists were shown the cranium photographs and couldn t recognize the beveled exit on the edge of the skull bone remember from above the autopsy pathologsts only ever reported identifying exit beveling on the edge of a skull fragment that s just one of those gigantic contradictions we re expected to accept i took this model skull and drew an outline representing the absolute maximum size skull cavity that could exist while still being consistent with the official hsca interpretation of the autopsy skull photographs clearly this is too small to lift or even rotate the official gram brain through removing a brain requires enough space to fit your hands underneath the brain these issues with the official inches above the eop interpretation of these photographs is compounded by the fact that the earliest evidence from the autopsy indicates that the pathologists thought the beveled exit in the skull was anatomically higher than the small head wound are the single assassin theorists going to ignore that too dr pierre finck has consistently stated that he arrived late to the autopsy after the top of the skull had already been opened up to facilitate the removal of the brain and yet he could still examine this small wound as an undisturbed perforation in the occipital bone again more indication that this hole was low in the head if there was an entry wound inches above the eop then the hole in the skull would have been among the portions of skull separated during the brain removal procedure some have argued that the hsca s interpretation of the photographs and finck s statements could be true if humes and boswell had just carefully sawed around this entry hole in the parietal bone this explanation cannot be true because the autopsy pathologists have already explained how fractured and brittle the area of skull around the large defect was and how virtually no sawing of the skull was necessary to create a skull cavity large enough to remove the brain some statements from the autopsy pathologists also indicate that just the scalp incision made for separating the top of the skull was not enough to expose the outer surface of the reported small hole in the skull and that a special incision lower in the scalp was required to expose it on a finishing note dr burkley suspected or believed that kennedy may have been struck in the head by more than one missile dr george burkley rode in the back of the motorcade in dallas on call at all times in case of medical emergency he briefly viewed kennedy s body in the emergency room at dallas flew on air force one to maryland and worked as a messenger between the autopsy pathologists and the kennedy family who stayed at the hospital until the body was restored for casket viewing burkley wrote his signature verifying the face sheet diagram of kennedy s wounds as well as the official autopsy report produced a few days later despite apparently feeling as if he had enough authority over the matter to sign the body sheet and autopsy report was not called by the warren commission to testify about his experience beginning at the motorcade at the dallas emergency room in maryland for the autopsy etc he only wrote a death certificate and a affidavit which no not mention any specific evidence about the head wounds except the fact that they were fatal he was interviewed by william manchester for his book the killing of a president but the only passage that could be relevant to forensic evidence is the lincoln continues to slow down its interior is a place of horror the last bullet has torn through john kennedy s cerebellum the lower part of his brain then in a interview at the jfk library burkley stated my conclusion in regard to the cause of death was the bullet wound which involved the skull the discussion as to whether a previous bullet also enters into it but as far as the cause of death the immediate cause was unquestionably the bullet which shattered the brain and the calvarium and when asked do you agree with the warren report on the number of bullets that entered the president s body he replied i would not care to be quoted on that the interviewer mentioned nothing of a discussion of whether a previous bullet entered into it burkley brought it up independently around the multiple shooter conspiracy theories mainly focused on arguing against the single bullet theory rather than arguing against the official story of a single gunshot to the back of the head so there is no sign of where burkley got this more than one bullet to the head idea years later a letter from dr burkley s attorney was sent to the hsca said he has information in the kennedy assassination indicating that others besides oswald must have participated and that burkley would be available to interview an august interview report written by dr purdy of the hsca medical panel reads dr burkley said the doctors didn t section the brain and that if it had been done it might be possible to prove whether or not there were two bullets dr burkley thinks there was one but concedes the possibility of there having been two burkley then gave a affidavit to the hsca only saying had the warren commission deemed to call me i would have stated why i retained the brain and the possibility of two bullets having wounded president john f kennedy s brain would have been eliminated i supervised the autopsy and directed the fixation and retention of the brain for future study of the course of the bullet or bullets and finally author henry hurt interviewed burkley in reasonable doubt page gt it is significant that dr burkley had been with the president in dallas with him in the parkland hospital emergency room with his body as it was flown east and present during the autopsy it is also significant that even though he was the only doctor present both at parkland and at bethesda dr burkley s testimony was never taken by the warren commission nor was it taken later by the house select committee gt in dr burkley told the author in a telephone conversation that he believed that president kennedy s assassination was the result of a conspiracy gt this startling statement after so long a silence amplified an obscure exchange dr burkley had in an oral history interview on file at the kennedy library in boston gt when he originally telephoned the author dr burkley expressed his willingness to discuss various matters concerning the assassination he asked for a letter detailing the areas the author wished to discuss dr burkley acknowledged receipt of the letter with a letter of his own two months later the author proposed a meeting with dr burkley to discuss the points the doctor responded with an abrupt refusal to discuss any aspect of the case can t explain the eop wound without a conspiracy many researchers suspect that the x rays have been faked and that the brain in the official photograph collection did not belong to kennedy but a conspiracy can be argued without invoking the fabrication of evidence different vantage points for a shooter different weapons different ammunition and different outlets for missiles striking kennedy s body should be open for consideration for all reasonable people whatever few explanations there are all of kennedy s head wounds cannot be explained by a single round fired from the depository even in a hypothetical scenario where an upper entry wound could be proven to exist on the x rays it would still have to coexist with the evidence for a lower wound the eop wound evidence is simply too credible to just retcon it out of existence to promote a simpler shooting scenario

44536,sam is wrong charles murray isn t some maligned or misunderstood academic facing overblown outrage sam has even admitted he did not read the bell curve when asked whether or not charles murray is a racist its important to remember what the goals of his research flawed data interpretations and or professional critique are ultimately aimed towards social policy not raw academic inquiry gt harvard scientist and evolutionary biologist stephen jay gould on race and iq refuting charles murray and the bell curve gt gt gt gould even eloquently punches through why these ideas are so commonly exploited in it was revealed that in murray s youth he participated in cross burnings then conveniently forgot about it and tried to play it off as kid antics gt here is a recent investigation into the resurgence of charles murray and his immensely flawed and racist motivations behind and within the bell curve and his other books gt any serious inquiry into charles murray s actual body of work must conclude that if murray is not a racist the word racist is empty of meaning i do not necessarily believe charles murray thinks he is a racist but i do believe that a fair review of the evidence must necessarily lead to the conclusion that he is one efforts to keep him from speaking on college campuses are while in my opinion wrong both in principle and strategically are entirely understandable for murray s intellectual project does involve passing off bigotry as neutral scholarship and people who worry about legitimizing prejudice by giving it a platform should very much be worried about giving charles murray a platform gt gt gt gt however having made clear what murray does not say let us examine what he does the following claims are defended in murray s writings gt gt black people tend to be dumber than white people which is probably partly why white people tend to have more money than black people this is likely to be partly because of genetics a question that would be valid and useful to investigate gt black cultural achievements are almost negligible western peoples have a superior tendency toward creating objectively more excellent art and music differences in cultural excellence across groups might also have biological roots gt we should return to the conception of equality held by the founding fathers who thought black people were subhumans a situation in which white people are politically and economically dominant over black people is natural and acceptable gt taken together these three claims show murray to be bigoted ignorant and ignorant of his own bigotry they more than justify the conclusion that he is a racist and they make it extraordinary that anyone could be surprised that murray s acceptance as a legitimate mainstream scholar causes a reaction of raw fury and disgust charles murray would likely dispute that the above three points are made in his work but the textual evidence is conclusive gt gt gt first black people tend to be dumber than white people the bell curve which murray co authored in with richard herrnstein is a book about the role of intelligence in society murray and herrnstein wished to prove that intelligence as measured by iq scores played a crucial role in determining a variety of social outcomes and that as a result a new kind of cognitive elite was arising murray and herrnstein did not endorse the preeminence of the cognitive elite and in fact worried over the effects of the change gt gt a core premise of the book is that intelligence is a meaningful and important concept and that it is captured by iq scores as they write iq scores match whatever it is that people mean when they use the word intelligent or smart in ordinary language and the opposite of being smart is they seem to believe being dumb gt gt what are this person s chances of being in poverty if he is very smart very dumb gt statistically smart men tend to be more farsighted than dumb men gt fertility patterns among the smart and the dumb and their possible long term effects on the intellectual capital of a nation s population gt gt we should be clear on why the murray herrnstein argument was both morally offensive and poor social science if they had stuck to what is ostensibly the core claim of the book that iq whatever it is is strongly correlated with one s economic status there would have been nothing objectionable about their work in fact it would even have been as murray himself has pointed out totally consistent with a left wing worldview iq predicts economic outcomes just means some particular set of mental abilities happen to be well adapted for doing the things that make you successful in contemporary u s capitalist society testing for iq is no different from testing whether someone can play the guitar or do jumping jacks or lick their elbow and the people who can do those certain valued things are forming a narrow elite at the expense of the underclass is a conclusion left wing people would be happy to entertain after all it s no different than saying people who have the good fortune to be skilled at finance are making a lot of money and thereby exacerbating inequality noam chomsky goes further and suggests that if we actually managed to determine the traits that predicted success under capitalism more relevant than intelligence would probably be some combination of greed cynicism obsequiousness and subordination lack of curiosity and independence of mind self serving disregard for others and who knows what else gt gt gt gt all of this is crucial context for understanding why people call charles murray a racist to black people jeffersonian equality cannot be separated from jefferson a man who continued to beat and rape black slaves despite the most eloquent pleas from black abolitionists murray is a racist in part because he doesn t think american history from the black perspective even counts it doesn t even need mentioning one can simply dismiss those who are horrified by your aristotelian hindu caste system jeffersonian notion of inherent human inequality they must be irrational they must simply be spewing politically correct dogmas they must be some of those beasts unfit for the natural aristocracy of the talented virtuous and wise gt gt i do not see then how if the word racism has any content charles murray is anything other than a racist he has argued that black people are dumber than white people that black culture is objectively less accomplished and worthwhile and that the founding fathers conception of social equality an inherently racist vision in its every aspect is worth reviving of course i do not know whether charles murray knows he is a racist just as i do not know what was in his mind when he burned a cross on a hill but when we put aside all of the distortions and exaggerations about his work and examine its text closely i do not see how we can escape the conclusion that charles murray thinks black people are inferior to white people and that having them in socially economically and politically subordinate positions is acceptable and let me be clear this is about black and white murray often praises asians in order to prove that he is not a white supremacist but with racism the question is not do you think you are the best race of all the races it is do you hold bigoted and unfair perceptions of a particular race and endorse their social subjugation there is a unique white bias against blacks in particular as a result of the color line that has run through the entirety of american history gt gt heres the actual account where murray conveniently pretends to not know what cross burnings mean and being unaware of why black people were so upset with him he didn t know cross burning was bad as a high school senior gt while there is much to admire about the industry and inquisitiveness of murray s teen age years there is at least one adventure that he understandably deletes from the story the night he helped his friends burn a cross they had formed a kind of good guys gang the mallows whose very name from marshmallows was a play on their own softness in the fall of during their senior year they nailed some scrap wood into a cross adorned it with fireworks and set it ablaze on a hill beside the police station with marshmallows scattered as a calling card gt gt rutledge recalls his astonishment the next day when the talk turned to racial persecution in a town with two black families there wouldn t have been a racist thought in our simple minded minds he says that s how unaware we were gt gt a long pause follows when murray is reminded of the event incredibly incredibly dumb he says but it never crossed our minds that this had any larger significance and i look back on that and say how on earth could we be so oblivious i guess it says something about that day and age that it didn t cross our minds in a piece for slate nicholas lemann noted that murray took the unusual step of sending them only to people handpicked by him and his publisher gt first wave of publicity was either credulous or angry but short on evidence because nobody had had time to digest and evaluate the book carefully gt another handpicked group was flown to washington at the expense of the american enterprise institute and given a weekend long personal briefing on the book s contents by murray himself herrnstein had died very recently just before publication murray and herrnstein relied on research from some of the world s most prominent academic racists in the december issue of the new york review of books charles lane dissected murray and herrnstein s sources and also present a massive in depth refutation of why murray s work is so poor and biased gt gt it s not all murray s data he used data of people who identified the white race as genetically superior to blacks gt these scientist belonged to a journal called mankind quarterly which as it happens published articles of ottmar von verschuer verschuer was the mentor of a nazi now i know you re all going to be amazed guess who his pupil was gt murray misreported the data gt murray chose studies and then chose which he thought were the best the study he ended up relying on a study from the same journal which tested black students who had years of school and claimed the students scored a which he extrapolated to the entire continent gt one of the questions from a different test that was posed to blacks in apartheid south africa showed people playing tennis and the test takers needed to scketch in the net to get the answer correct gt of the studies five were conducted in apartheid south africa an additional one was in the belgian congo gt as far as asains having a higher iq murray relied on one study of japanese children all from wealthy backgrounds gt murray s conclusion caucasians and mongoloids are the only two races that have contributed to civilization gt a more rigorous study that murray mentions found no differance between asian and american children gt gt gt most curious of the sources murray and herrnstein consulted was a journal of anthropology called mankind quarterly he pointed out that no fewer than five articles from mankind quarterly were cited in the book s bibliography and researchers cited by the bell curve contributed to the journal more information on mankind quarterly from the actual editor in chief actually proving the mankind quarterly is a white supremacist eugenicist publication from mankind quarterly s white supremacist origins lane wrote gt mankind quarterly was established during decolonization and the us civil rights movement defenders of the old order were eager to brush a patina of science on their efforts thus mankind quarterly s avowed purpose was to counter the communist and egalitarian influences that were allegedly causing anthropology to neglect the fact of racial differences the crimes of the nazis wrote robert gayre mankind quarterly s founder and editor in chief until did not however justify the enthronement of a doctrine of a racialism as fact nor of egalitarianism as ethnically and ethically demonstrable gt gayre was a champion of apartheid in south africa and belonged to the ultra right candour league of white ruled rhodesia in he testified for the defense at the hate speech trial of five members of the british racial preservation society offering his expert opinion that blacks are worthless the founders of mankind quarterly also included henry e garrett of columbia university a one time pamphleteer for the white citizens councils who provided expert testimony for the defense in brown v board of education and corrado gini leader of fascist italy s eugenics movement and author of a mussolini apologia called the scientific basis of fascism abc news in ran a story about murray and herrnstein s sources who were recipients of grant money from the pioneer fund a eugenicist think tank founded by multimillionaire and white supremacist wickliffe draper a lot of the pioneer fund s donations have gone towards individuals with a eugenicist slant the fairness and accuracy in reporting fair pointed out in a report that richard lynn who murray and herrnstein used for their conclusions on the iqs of east asians received from the pioneer fund lynn s work had been featured in mankind quarterly and he had made cryptic statements about phasing out what he called incompetent cultures gt murray and herrnstein describe lynn as a leading scholar of racial and ethnic differences here s a sample of lynn s thinking on such differences cited in newsday what is called for here is not genocide the killing off of the population of incompetent cultures but we do need to think realistically in terms of the phasing out of such peoples evolutionary progress means the extinction of the less competent to think otherwise is mere sentimentality another source named arthur jensen received from the pioneer fund and once said that eugenics isn t a crime jensen also worried that current welfare policies unaided by genetic foresight could lead to the genetic enslavement of a substantial portion of our population murray and herrnstein praised jensen claiming that they benefited especially from his work and called him a giant in the profession gt another person whose advice murray and herrnstein benefitted especially from and who shows up constantly in their footnotes is arthur jensen whose very similar claims about blacks having innately lower iqs were widely discredited in the s the pioneer fund has given more than million to this giant in the profession as pioneer chief weyher describes him gq and it s easy to see why eugenics isn t a crime jensen has said newsday which is worse to deprive someone of having a child or to deprive the child of having a decent set of parents gt elsewhere jensen cited in counterpunch has worried that current welfare policies unaided by genetic foresight could lead to the genetic enslavement of a substantial portion of our population richard lynn also has ties to both the pioneer fund and murray lynn also comes to the defense of murray several times to deflect from accusations of academic racism stephen jay gould had a well regarded take down of the book many of the takeaways from tbc is that iq is unchangeable despite talking about changes its directly contradictory all researchers in this area including herrnstein and murray acknowledge the problems of generalizing from within group differences in intelligence i e within a white population to between groups differences e g differences between whites and blacks these authors do it anyway gt gt let us consider body height a much more inheritable trait than iq as gould suggests there is no question but that the average height of indian males from a nutritionally deprived village would significantly increase in a few generations with improved nutrition by analogy the well documented point iq difference between american whites and blacks permits no automatic conclusion that truly equal opportunities for blacks would not equal or surpass the white iq average gt herrnstein and murray acknowledge the empirical fact that one can not prejudge any one black person because so many blacks score higher than the average white iq score however these authors down play the strong circumstantial evidence for the malleability as opposed to immutability of iq scores e g the iq scores of poor black children adopted into affluent and intellectual homes and the well documented observation that iq scores have steadily risen in the us and other technologically advanced countries at a rate of points per decade since i e more than a full standard deviation this is referred to as the flynn effect and is not well understood gt is the existence of g upon which iq is based a given reality herrnstein and murray do not even attempt to justify their assumption that spearman s g has construct validity i e measures what it purports to measure they simply state that the assumption of the existence g and that it is accepted by experts in the field by experts they mean psychometricians who themselves raise serious criticism of g cf neisser et al there is also a huge question about the validity of g gt simply stated spearman used factor analysis to find a common factor among positive correlation in various mental tests as any first year graduate student knows such positive correlation s would be expected but say nothing about causality thurstone later demonstrated with factor analysis that g could be made to disappear by simply rotating the dimensions to different positions in some instances creating the notion of separate and multiple intelligences gt even in the absence of a deep understanding of factor analysis it should be immediately obvious that g can not be an inherent reality as assumed by herrnstein and murray as it can be made to emerge in one mathematical formulation and disappears or is greatly reduced in an other mathematical formulation gt they also flubbed data to fit their conclusions gt this says nothing however about cultural bias which is often confused with s bias a discussion in which herrnstein and murray do not engage fischer et al note that bell curve analysis is based on the armed forces qualifying test afqt which is not an iq test but designed to predict performance of certain criterion variables the math section requires high school algebra gt furthermore they note that the original plot of the afqt data is not in the shape of the required bell curve since herrnstein and murray require a bell curve for their theory they reshaped the original data to fit their theory here we have an example of theory driving the data gt in their reanalysis fischer et al conclude that a person s life chances depend on their social surroundings at least as much as their own intelligence they conclude that the key finding of the bell curve i e iq as a predictor of ses is an artifact of its own method gt hitchens on murray in there is a concern about how they fitted their data to support their correlations gt the presentation of statistical analyses by herrnstein and murray suggests that they are deliberately manipulative with regards to the data disingenuous and seek to fit the data to the theory rather than vice versa specifically in multiple regression equations with regards to the ses data they hold iq constant and then consider the relationship of social behaviors to parental ses gt they then hold ses constant consider the relationship of the same behaviors to iq in general they find a higher correlation with iq than ses this is acceptable as far as it goes but as gould astutely observes herrnstein and murray plot only the regression curve but not the scatter around the curve i e variance due to iq and social factors gt when more thoroughly considered the relationships that they proposed based on their own data are weak specifically they report r the goodness of fit in the appendix where few will ever see it gt why gt because their entire argument is based on an r which simply stated predicts approximately of the variance hardly a compelling statistic on which to base significant social policy as herrnstein and murray suggest or of the much nastier eugenics suggestions as miller proposes a vast majority of the r measures excluded from the main body of the text are less than and hidden in appendix their own data make the conclusions of the bell curve simply indefensible gt this is a more in depth look at the sources and flaws of the bell curve methodology lynn has himself advocated for a white ethnostate in a right wing magazine gt i think the only solution lies in the breakup of the united states blacks and hispanics are concentrated in the southwest the southeast and the east but the northwest and the far northeast maine vermont and upstate new york have a large predominance of whites i believe these predominantly white states should declare independence and secede from the union they would then enforce strict border controls and provide minimum welfare which would be limited to citizens if this were done white civilization would survive within this handful of states reddit s own u pequod on these same flawed origins and background on murray and his associates flat out eugenicist end goal and academic racism gt gt more specifically the part about murray s background and sources is at then check out this episode of chapo trap house at gt for more on murray including his cross burning pseudoscience history and support for discriminatory and anti integration policies one more hint is this section of the book which is straight up eugenics the authors recommended the end of welfare policies that encourage poor women to have babies gt we can imagine no recommendation for using the government to manipulate fertility that does not have dangers but this highlights the problem the united states already has policies that inadvertently social engineer who has babies and it is encouraging the wrong women if the united states did as much to encourage high iq women to have babies as it now does to encourage low iq women it would rightly be described as engaging in aggressive manipulation of fertility the technically precise description of america s fertility policy is that it subsidizes births among poor women who are also disproportionately at the low end of the intelligence distribution we urge generally that these policies represented by the extensive network of cash and services for low income women who have babies be ended the government should stop subsidizing births to anyone rich or poor the other generic recommendation as close to harmless as any government program we can imagine is to make it easy for women to make good on their prior decision not to get pregnant by making available birth control mechanisms that are increasingly flexible foolproof inexpensive and safe his policy recommendations include trying to remove welfare programs under the guise that blacks are just never going to get it murray further advocates for more eugenics in several interviews including this one gt you want to have a job training program for welfare mothers you think that s going to cure the welfare problem well when you construct that job training program and try to decide what jobs they might qualify for you had better keep in mind that the mean iq of welfare mothers is somewhere in the s which means that you have certain limitations in what you re going to accomplish gt have you ever heard of barack obama well he denounced the book too gt gt mr obama the idea that inferior genes account for the problems of the poor in general and blacks in particular isn t new of course racial supremacists have been using iq tests to support their theories since the turn of the century the arguments against such dubious science aren t new either scientists have repeatedly told us that genes don t vary much from one race to another and psychologists have pointed out the role that language and other cultural barriers can play in depressing minority test scores and no one disputes that children whose mothers smoke crack when they re pregnant are going to have developmental problems gt gt now it shouldn t take a genius to figure out that with early intervention such problems can be prevented but mr murray isn t interested in prevention he s interested in pushing a very particular policy agenda specifically the elimination of affirmative action and welfare programs aimed at the poor with one finger out to the political wind mr murray has apparently decided that white america is ready for a return to good old fashioned racism so long as it s artfully packaged and can admit for exceptions like colin powell it s easy to see the basis for mr murray s calculations after watching their income stagnate or decline over the past decade the majority of americans are in an ugly mood and deeply resent any advantages realor perceived that minorities may enjoy theres a litany of sources that literally challenge and debunk the bell curve and charles murray gt review of bell curve gt gt primer on heritability gt gt paper covering subjects related to iq gt gt criticism of jensen and the genetic biodeterminist camp gt gt another paper on race iq heritability gt gt interesting paper on how models contribute to estimates of heritability gt gt blackness doesn t correlate with intelligence gt gt primer on genetic diversity in humans gt gt heritability reduction in twin models by including a single additional environmental variable showing issues inherent with twin studies gt gt philosopher paper about inherent flaws in models comparing race gt gt heritability if moderated by socioeconomic status gt gt home environment was greatest factor in neuro devlopment of infants when nicholas wade tried to make similar arguments resurrecting continental races leading population geneticists denounced his claims dalton conley examined major theses of the bell curve with data from the genomic revolution people usually focus on the extension of charles murray s claims to race but his thesis that poor people are genetically different is equally dangerous and biologically inaccurate if i remember correctly charles murray s policy prescription to the problem of dysgenics is cutting off all welfare so that poor people won t survive and reproduce to avoid idiocracy lets read in between the lines of his own book and call out where he s trying to create policy proposals based on immigration gt since the main ethnic groups referring to immigrants vs whites differ in average iq a shift in america s ethnic makeup referring to intrinsic high birth rates of immigrants vs lower birth rates of whites as established before in the book implies a change in the overall average iq even disregarding the impact of differential fertility within ethnic groups the shifting ethnic makeup by itself would lower the average american iq by points per generation bell curve p lets review this rather damning compilation of flaws in murray as well maybe they will listen to ol hitch hitch on the forbidden knowledge gt there is no gene for i q and there is no genetic or evolutionary timing that is short enough to explain histories or societies minority report nation gt arguing not long ago against the fans of murray and herrnstein s pseudoscientific the bell curve one was hard put to choose when deciding which fallacy to ridicule first was it their definition of race itself a concept utterly negated by the tracing of the human genome or was it their definition of intelligence tinkering with the death machine gt in some earlier work on jesse jackson reed denounced jackson s opportunist adoption of the definition african american reed s is a colorblind antiracism and antitribalism in a particularly mordant attack on the pseudoscience of the bell curve he repudiates not just the relegation of blacks to a cognitive lumpenproletariat but the corollary assumption that anyone not dark in hue is therefore white and measurable as such this he asserts does not rise even to the superficiality of the skin deep erasing the color line gt on newt gingrich he criticized charles murray s notorious tract the bell curve a book with totemic status on the right because it treated people as categories rather than individuals newtopia gt there is and there always has been an unusually high and consistent correlation between the stupidity of a given person and that person s propensity to be impressed by the measurement of i q minority report nation gt linguistics genetics paleontology anthropology all are busily demonstrating that we as a species have no objective problem of race what we still do seem to have are all these racists minority report nation edit the essay and one additional clip mentioning the bell curve lets get to the point this is all about pushing a conservative fiscal and social policy that is anti egalitarian and anti state for charles murray look at his policy suggestions gt in the past race science has shaped not only political discourse but also public policy the year after the bell curve was published in the lead up to a republican congress slashing benefits for poorer americans murray gave expert testimony before a senate committee on welfare reform more recently congressman paul ryan who helped push the republicans latest tax cuts for the wealthy has claimed murray as an expert on poverty gt gt gt gt in apartheid south africa the idea that each race had its own character personality traits and intellectual potential was part of the justification for the system of white rule the subject of race and iq was similarly politicised in the us where jensen s paper was used to oppose welfare schemes such as the head start programme which were designed to lift children out of poverty but the paper met with an immediate and overwhelmingly negative reaction an international firestorm the new york times called it years later in jensen s obituary especially on american university campuses where academics issued dozens of rebuttals and students burned him in effigy gt gt gt gt gt yet race science maintains its hold on the imagination of the right and today s rightwing activists have learned some important lessons from past controversies using youtube in particular they attack the left liberal media and academic establishment for its unwillingness to engage with the facts and then employ race science as a political battering ram to push forward their small state anti welfare anti foreign aid agenda gt gt these political goals have become ever more explicit when interviewing nicholas wade stefan molyneux argued that different social outcomes were the result of different innate iqs among the races as he put it high iq ashkenazi jews and low iq black people wade agreed saying that the role played by prejudice in shaping black people s social outcomes is small and diminishing before condemning wasted foreign aid for african countries gt gt similarly when sam harris in his podcast interview with charles murray pointed out the troubling fact that the bell curve was beloved by white supremacists and asked what the purpose of exploring race based differences in intelligence was murray didn t miss a beat its use murray said came in countering policies such as affirmative action in education and employment based on the premise that everybody is equal above the neck whether it s men or women or whether it s ethnicities u felix explains why murray s creeping and subversive attempts at removing the welfare state is really about enforcing racism gt i ll tell you why the right cares about this they want to dismantle the welfare state and any attempt at the government addressing income inequality in society gt gt charles murray has spent most of his career successfully dismantling the welfare state the clintons did huge repeals of the welfare state based on murray s earlier works like losing ground isn t that something the liberal clintons did a massive repeal of an anti poverty program based on the work of a conservative gt gt if you can plant the seed within the collective zeitgeist that the outcomes we have are due to genetics and biology you no longer have to worry about the poor you no longer have to worry about the rights of the aggrieved gt gt you no longer have to have inheritance taxes you no longer have a need to tax the rich the way we do gt gt you no longer have a moral justification to distribute wealth from the rich

including documented flights even the house staff testified that defendant and ms giuffre were regularly together page the record evidence in this case shows that defendant shared a household with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein for many years while there she actively took part in recruiting underage girls and young women for sex with epstein as well as scheduling the girls to come over and

on epstein s private jets the lolita express with defendant at least times ms sjoberg s account of her experiences with defendant are chillingly similar as with ms giuffre defendant a perfect stranger

day a young college student case document page of nearly miles from home defendant soon instructed ms sjoberg to massage epstein and made it clear that sjoberg s purpose was to bring epstein to orgasm

the interference of epstein s lawyer page notably at defendant s deposition defendant refused to admit that she flew with ms giuffre and denied that she appeared on epstein s pilot s flight logs however david rodgers epstein pilot testified that the passenger listed on his flight logs bearing the initials gm was in fact ghislaine maxwell and that he was the pilot on at least flights in which defendant flew with plaintiff the dates of those flights show that ms giuffre was an underage child on many of them when she flew with defendant both sarah kellen and nadia marcinkova lived with jeffrey epstein for many years they both invoked the fifth amendment when asked about defendant s participation in recruiting underage girls for sex with epstein page jeffrey epstein invoked the fifth amendment when asked about defendant s involvement in procuring underage girls for sex with him page defendant has not been able to procure a single witness not one to testify that defendant did not procure girls for sex with epstein or participate in the sex even one of her own witnesses tony figueroa testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex another one of defendant s witnesses ms giuffre s mother named defendant as ms giuffre s new mamma indeed those who knew her well who spent considerable time with her in epstein s shared household like juan alessi alfredo rodriguez and joanna sjoberg have testified that she was epstein s procuress others who lived with her jeffrey epstein nadia marcinkova and sarah kellen invoked the fifth amendment so as not to answer questions on the same no one has testified to the contrary defendant has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with and why she was traveling with a minor child on flights while she was a child including international flights aboard a convicted pedophile s private jet all over the world page defendant never offered an explanation regarding ms giuffre s photographs of her defendant and epstein she never offered a legal explanation for why prince andrew was photographed with his hand around ms giuffre s bare waist while she was a minor child while posing with defendant inside defendant s house in london this photograph corroborates ms giuffre s claims and there is no other reasonable explanation why an american child should be in the company of adults not her kin in the london house owned by the girlfriend of a now convicted sex offender ms giuffre also produced pictures of herself taken when she was in new york with defendant and epstein and from a trip to europe with defendant and epstein page ms giuffre has produced a number of pictures of herself taken at the zorro ranch epstein s new mexico ranch among other nude photos which included full nudes of

york while she was a minor the dates on the hospital records show she was seventeen years old page defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of ms giuffre s medical history defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of ms giuffre s medical history defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice ms giuffre sought counseling from a psychologist for the trauma she continued to experience after being abused by defendant and epstein a psychological treatment record written by her treating psychologist unambiguously describes defendant as ms giuffre s abuser page years before defendant defamed her ms giuffre confided in her treating psychologist that maxwell recruited her for sex with epstein detective recarey the lead investigator of the criminal investigation into epstein and his associates sex crimes recovered carbon copies of hand written messages taken by various staff including defendant at epstein s palm beach residence the messages raise a question of fact as to maxwell s involvement in the sexual abuse of minors and are relevant to refute maxwell s denial of any involvement with epstein during relevant time periods and accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events page messages reveals that maxwell gm took messages at the residence including from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see epstein page one message pad reflects who is identified in the palm beach police report as a minor contacting jeffrey epstein for work explaining that she does not have any money the term work was often used by members of jeffrey epstein s sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual massages giuffre july th no year to je from i need work i mean i don t have money do you have some work for me other message pads reflect who was a minor calling and leaving a message at the palm beach mansion that she has recruited another girl for jeffrey epstein the second message demonstrates that jeffrey epstein required different girls to be scheduled every day of the week the third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the home at the same time to provide sexual massages these type of messages indicate the lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were visiting every day and at least raises a question of fact whether maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as giuffre has said or whether giuffre was lying and maxwell was not at all involved or aware of this activity as defendant would attempt to have the world believe giuffre undated jeffrey from has girl for tonight giuffre pictured above mr epstein from is available on tuesday no one for tomorrow giuffre mr epstein from me and can come tomorrow any time or alone giuffre undated jeffrey from has girl for tonight other message pads demonstrate that there was a pattern and practice of using young females to recruit additional young females to provide sexual massages on a daily basis giuffre pictured above je from n hasn t confirmed for yet so she is keeping on hold in

russian girl for purposes of sex giuffre pictured above for jeffrey from jean luc he has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak russian she is x years old not blonde lessons are free and you can have your st today if you call page this message pad directly refutes maxwell s sworn testimony that she was not present during the year at jeffrey epstein s palm beach mansion because this shows leaving a message for jeffrey at the palm beach home that she was going to work out see mccawley dec at exhibit case document page of with the defendant on september the police were only able to retrieve a fraction of these message pads during their trash pull but even in the few they recovered it shows maxwell was regularly at the palm beach home during the time period she claimed she was not to the contrary she was both sending and receiving messages and messages like this one reflect her presence at the mansion giuffre during the year maxwell says she was never around je from i went to sarah and made her water bottle and i went to work out with gm these message pads further corroborate that defendant lied in her testimony and she was in fact in regular contact with jeffrey epstein during the years and for example the message from larry demonstrates that defendant is at the palm beach mansion so frequently that people including epstein s main pilot larry visoski are leaving messages for maxwell at the palm beach house giuffre mr epstein from ms maxwell tell him to call me giuffre je from gm giuffre for ms maxwell from larry returning your call this message pad shows that defendant was clearly actively involved in jeffrey epstein s life and the activities at his palm beach mansion giuffre undated jeffrey from ghislaine would be helpful to have come to palm beach today to stay here and help train new staff with ghislaine this message pad clearly reflects an underage female noted by the police redaction of the name leaving a message asking if she can come to the house at a later time because she needs to stay in school giuffre pictured above jeffrey redacted name she is wondering if is o k she needs to stay in school this message pad reflects a message from who was under the age of eighteen at the time she was going over to jeffrey epstein s home to provide sexual massages according to the palm beach investigative report giuffre to jeffrey from it is o k for to stop by and drop something these message pads reflect the pattern of underage girls noted by the police redaction of the name on the message pad calling the palm beach mansion to leave a message about sending a female over to provide a sexual massage giuffre to mr je redacted from i have a female for him giuffre pictured above je to je from redacted i have a female for him page this message pad reflects the pattern and practice of having young girls bring other young girls to the house to perform sexual massages indeed the reflected in this message pad corresponds in name to the that tony figueroa testified he initially brought to jeffrey epstein during the time period that the defendant was requesting that tony find some young females to bring to jeffrey epstein s home see figueroa at the palm beach police report reflects that and also brought seventeen year old to the home to perform sexual massages see giuffre thereafter recruited a number of other young girls to perform sexual case document page of massages as reflected in the palm beach police report giuffre pictured above je from wants to know if she should bring her friend with tonight this message pad reflects multiple sexual massages being scheduled for the same day which corroborates virginia giuffre and johanna sjorberg s testimony that jeffrey epstein required that he have multiple orgasms in a day which occurred during these sexual massages giuffre pictured above je from i left message for to confirm for a m and for p m this message pad shows a friend of jeffrey epstein s discussing with him how he had sex with an year old who had also been with jeffrey epstein giuffre pictured above undated je from jean luc he just did a good one years she spoke to me and said i love jeffrey law enforcement was able to confirm identities of underage victims through the use of the names and telephone numbers in these message pads page the black book palm beach police confiscated an extensive lists of contacts with their phone numbers form defendant and epstein s residence ghislaine maxwell maintained a contact list in an see mccawley dec at exhibit recarey dep tr at case document page of approximately page long hard copy which was openly available to other house employees it consisted primarily of telephone numbers addresses or email addresses for various personal friends associates employees or personal or business connections of epstein or defendant prior to being terminated by defendant the palm beach house butler alfredo rodriguez printed a copy of this document and ultimately provided it to the fbi this document reflects the numerous phone numbers of defendant epstein as well as staff phone numbers additionally and importantly there are several sections entitled massage alongside a geographical designation with names of females and corresponding telephone numbers these numbers included those of underage females with no training in massage therapy including identified during the criminal investigation of epstein this document is an authentic reflection of the people who were associated with epstein defendant and the management of their properties and the knowledge each had of the contents of the document sex slave amazon com book receipt detective recarey authenticated an amazon com receipt that the palm beach police collected from jeffrey epstein s trash the books he ordered are titled sm a realistic introduction wiseman jay slavecraft roadmaps for erotic servitude principles skills and tools by guy baldwin and training with miss abernathy a workbook for erotic slaves and their owners by christina abernathy as shown below see mccawley dec at exhibit phone list public records request no at case document page of this disturbing purchase corroborate ms giuffre s account of being sexually exploited by defendant and epstein not to mention the dozens of underage girls in the palm beach police report additionally defendant testified that she was not with jeffrey epstein in and when he was ordering books on how to use sex slaves however record evidence contradicts that testimony page thailand folder with defendant s phone number defendant also was integral in arranging to have virginia go to thailand while epstein had paid for a massage therapy session in thailand there was a catch defendant told virginia she had to meet young girls in thailand and bring her back to the u s for epstein and defendant indeed on the travel records and tickets defendant gave to virginia defendant wrote on the back the name of the girl virginia was supposed to meet and she was also instructed to check in frequently with defendant as it was further signified by the words call ms maxwell on virginia s travel documents in this case virginia also produced the hard copy records from her hotel stay in thailand paid for by epstein the fbi report and the churcher emails reference ms giuffre s accounts of sexual activity with prince andrew that she made in contrary to defendant s argument that ms giuffre never made such claims until
44998,well i didn t get much sleep and posting this goes against the recommendation of my doctor epstein gal pal found at in n out reading book on deaths of cia operatives but i finished it and just in time for friday morning first i would just like to say thank you to everyone who upvoted shared this and gave me an award you guys really motivated me to keep reading this stuff and broke my reddit with all the comments last night we reached th on the front page i almost died when i saw that just shock don t worry so many people must have seen it and that is my biggest hope for this work the more eyes the better we need to bring an end to this international pedo sex operation the first step is being informed second for all of you asking no i do not intend to kill myself by shooting myself in the back of the head twice strangling myself in a way more common with murder then suicide such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves particularly if they are older according to forensics experts and studies on the subject but they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation the experts said or any other way to be clear i am a little exhausted grossed out stopped following a few people broke my reddit but not my neck thankfully in a mysterious fall but other then that i am great third there is one section of pages exhibit e through k that you might want to skip over if you are trying to save time i feel this section is important because it shows the lengths maxwell would go try to discredit giuffre even though in the first dump it appears the lawyers for giuffre argued that very little of this was used in the defenses case in their motion to dismiss and what is going on in the underlining proceedings involved in with the documents lawyers will probably enjoy this the most and go read those sources directly otherwise you can skip that content if you want personally i would still read it there are some names you might want since many of you also keep asking yes you can share this content do what ever you want with it copy and paste save it put it on your own blogs use it for your own research make a video out of it make fun of it anything is approved censorship is a issue we all have to help to overcome the only thing i ask is if you share it please try to link back the original reddit page so people can upvote it i don t mind if you are looking for karma or views but the more upvotes on a single post the more we get boosted to the front page and the more eyes that will see it if you do not want to lose it you can bookmark it by clicking the little flag on the top right finally here are a few things to look out for names of lawyers associates to epstein claims about prince andrews shady deals and friends what the newspapers wrote at the time how giuffre got the job at mar a lago testimony from fianc at time father and others overall this dump is less salacious then the first but i feel just as important especially for trying to

46561,the blm movement is going to be remembered as one of society s largest scale incidents of mass hysteria built on overt lies and hatred by nature of their support hundreds of thousands of otherwise good people are socially endorsing the violence that arises from these hateful causes based on utter fabrications the definition of terrorism the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce especially for political purposes whether you support their cause or not both blm and antifa as organizations fit the literal definition of terrorism if you don t call them that yourself that s fine until recently neither did the american government but merely saying that they aren t terrorists because you might think they have a reason for their actions is a subjective opinion on something that is otherwise an objective fact blm antifa and their supporters are responsible for a great number of increasingly violent attacks in recent years targeted towards opposing views namely white people and trump supporters where they ve earned the ire that s currently directed towards them it s time we collectively began to address these left wing extremists for what they truly are black lives matter as both an organization and as a social statement were founded primarily on the basis of systemic racism and police brutality both of which have very little merit outside of left wing echochambers with almost all of its messaging crumbling under the slightest bit of scrutiny if it s supporters ever bothered to scrutinize what they are being indoctrinated by systemic racism is a catch all term for any and everything to do with race applied ad hoc to whatever scenarios people would like changed whether that s in the public and private school systems our systems of law and the histories of great nations no legal definition or even standard application of the word has been decided and everyone has their own variation on what the word means and yet governmental bodies themselves and people are changing the way we act talk and think in order to combat this vague theory and i stress that word police brutality has been a term applied to virtually any instance of law enforcement being applied with force and sometimes even without it specifically and especially in regards to any crime committed by someone of the black community repeated study after study of police shootings has disputed any notion of racism being a factor in police shootings and yet the stereotype of evil racist police continues to spread some studies have even shown the opposite to be true that white officers are less likely to shoot black suspects and adjusted for ratios in crime and population white suspects are more likely to be shot by cops various studies to follow below and yet every time a black person is killed by police regardless of whether or not they were resisting arrest or actively trying to hurt or kill other people the police brutality and racism cards have been pulled to demonize lawful shootings to undermine the faith citizens have in their police and government here are some facts and statistics or what would probably be considered the real enemy to the blm movement the truth in american cops make about arrests a year those ten million arrests don t include detentions traffic stops or any of the other peaceful public interactions that make up the remaining approximately police and citizen contact every year on average per year only about of those million people interacted with end up dead due to police yet people act like their chances of dying at the hands of a cop are anything but minuscule the entire blm narrative is built on the foundation of police brutality and racism that simply isn t reflected in reality we re not even going to begin to discuss how many of those people killed by cops each year are armed and dangerous which is the majority of cases or how many of them aren t black also the majority it s also important to note that in police reporting unarmed does not mean not violent we can even assume for the sake of argument that none of those police killings each year are justified even though the vast majority of them are the ratio of unarmed black men shot and killed in was out of black men arrested according to the fbi s uniform crime reporting there were sworn police officers in the united states in that s one unarmed black male shot and killed for every sworn police officers out of the nearly million black americans the police have shot roughly one unarmed black male per roughly million people the inevitable conversation that follows is that black people only represent of the us population how is it that they make up such a high number of overall police deaths blm and it s supporters would like to propagate the idea that it s racism which fortunately has little factual basis in this topic this is where we need to have those brutal honest conversations that everyone claims to want to have regarding race silence is violence after all but nobody is actually allowed to discuss without being banned canceled or called a racist nazi in the us the american black population represents of convicted murders of rapes of robberies of assaults of weapons charges of domestic abuse and of drug abuse violations among others continuing to over index in almost all areas of remaining crime the vast majority of these crimes were conducted by males meaning that half of the violent crime in america is committed by less than the roughly of black men in the us it s not only understandable but expected that there would be a higher degree of violence involved in these arrests as usually the type of person that s being arrested for murder isn t likely to go without a fight nor would they like to spend their lives in prison ignoring these facts is tantamount to delusion almost all studies that conclude that black people are killed disproportionately fail to factor in crime rates into their models whether on purpose to reach a desired conclusion or via a poor scientific process those are very relevant statistics that cannot be ignored when discussing police interactions with black people nor can they be discarded in studies as they help to explain why there is a disparity between the black population and arrests deaths many who like to dismiss these figures do so by doing what they always do and cry racism whether it s the mere use of these statistics or in the very core of every single arrest that makes up the data but simply hand waving away the reason that there are so many violent interactions between the black community and the police due to racism is disingenuous and deliberate the reasons behind those crime rates and why the black community is plagued by crime are extraordinarily complicated and very well may contain elements of race and racism reaching back decades such as the welfare system and jim crow laws but that s an entirely separate conversation for another day unrelated to the premise of police brutality towards blacks the fact of the matter is the black community has and will continue to have problems with overwhelming violence without real intervention and its these problems that lead to further violent interactions with police keeping the aforementioned statistics in mind each year american cops kill more white people both in raw numbers and when adjusted for crime rates than black people note the study has since been retracted due to public inference however the data included remains valid even more studies with similar findings below only roughly of all arrests ended with a civilian death regardless of race and for every deadly weapon assaults on a police officer there was as a result of fatal police shooting or in other words even in encounters with deadly weapons police will only fatally shoot about of the time in fact research done by the national police research platform only roughly of those officers report ever even firing their gun on duty which doesn t specifically entail actually shooting someone either just the fact that they ve shot their weapon and yet the narrative of blood thirsty police persists contrary to the black lives matter narrative the police have much more to fear from black males than black males have to fear from the police in black civil rights commissioner peter kirsanow famously defended the police by acknowledging that a police officer is roughly x more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer a number that s been repeated ad nauseam and is roughly supported by statistics year after year it lowers to roughly x more likely for a cop to be killed by armed black males than the reverse factually black males have made up nearly percent of all cop killers over the last decade even though they are only of the overall population white people make up roughly over of known race homicide victims with caucasians representing roughly of the total us population black people were of known race homicide victims but only of the population which means the homicide rate for blacks was x their percentage of the us population making them over five times as likely to be homicide victims according to a bureau of justice statistics study of violent crimes against whites were committed by blacks for a total of crimes with violent black offenders being x their percent of the population in contrast whites committed of violent crimes against blacks for a total of crimes making up x their percentage of the population but of violent crime against black people of the time the offender was reported by the victim themselves as black which is supportive of the epidemic of black on black violence increasing across the country the offender to victim ratio shows that violent incidents involving black offenders was twice the percentage of black victims hate crime statistics actually show that in recent years anti black incidents overall fell to a recent record low share of all hate crime while anti white and other races have seen increases in hate crime towards them meanwhile hate crimes committed by black offenders continues to increase year over year reaching a high of of all reported hate crimes despite making up only of the population in major cities such as new york black perpetrators make up the majority of hate crimes towards jewish and lgbt people again despite the narrative that says black people are society s current victims of discrimination people need to stop acting like just because they re black they ll die if they interact with the cops or that white people are targeting black people with racism and hatred of course in a country of hundreds of millions of people there is going to be anti black racism but it certainly isn t to the degree in which activists like to perpetuate such as it being a public health crisis statistics simply do not reflect any reality in which this absurdity is true unless a concentrated effort is put into disqualifying and discounting data that opposes the narrative if anything the crime data statistics on police shootings and the general modern societal zeitgeist would suggest an active and ongoing discrimination against whites but hey that s another topic for another day isn t it the questions that decent human beings need to seriously ask themselves in regards to police is are you committing crimes are you going to resist if the cops try to arrest you i would hope not for both of those questions in there s no excuse for that level of ignorance therefore your chances of dying at the hands of the police are virtually zero but the best part is even if you are committing crimes and resisting arrest your chances of dying at the hands of the police are still virtually zero regardless of your skin color or particular demographic that s the statistical fact no matter how many slogans are chanted or how many times acab is gratified onto buildings it doesn t suddenly mean the police are out to kill anyone the gaslighting from the media and the blm supporters claim that the violent actions of a few rioters do not represent most of the peaceful group a courtesy not extended to the legitimately mostly peaceful police the left leaning armed conflict location amp event data project reports that in the summer of alone not including the continued riots in september there were demonstrations related to blm of those over included some sort of assault on police and or bystanders arson or looting but yet were not declared riots over of those peaceful protests in locations turned violent to the degree that they were declared riots that s mostly peaceful protests barely covered by mainstream news that seemingly most supporters of blm refuse to acknowledge even occurred which included an estimated billion dollars in damages most of which isn t covered by insurance done to local family businesses many black owned along with a few dozen related fatalities including targeted accidental and incidental more to follow below and countless incidents of arson looting and assault against bystanders and police acled also stated that of those demonstrations only of them have been met with force by police which is obviously roughly the same percentage of protests that become violent riots only of course the media and blm supporters would like you to believe that police by way of fascist trump are arresting and attacking peaceful protesters utilizing their freedom of speech which couldn t be further from the truth the freedom of speech was designed to protect people from those who think violence is the solution to democratic problems inciting violence was written in as an exception to the amendment in part so that people couldn t use strength against others to assert beliefs there s legal and historical precedence for proper freedom of speech and freedom to protest and nobody should care about the personal interpretations of rioters and terrorists on those fundamental freedoms and yet here we are in a society where the mainstream media an extraordinarily vocal minority of citizens multinational billion dollar businesses donating hundreds of millions to the cause that partially goes to fund rioters bail from jail after arrests multiple criminals who then went on to commit other murders celebrities and sports teams are all siding with blm over blatantly false lies and misinformation all the while supporting the notion that black people are being oppressed and victimized none of their opinions on equality inclusive ideologies and the freedom of speech actually extends to the mostly peaceful police officers towards white people or any other demographic that condemns these actions such as the increasing number of liberals leaving the party walkaway or the various minority groups now increasingly supporting trump people need to forgo emotional arguments for rational analysis stop confusing correlation with causation and understand the impact of confounding variables and their own bias in these discussions because what is happening is society and the regressive left is fostering an environment based on hate in the name of acceptance including the willful return of segregation affirmative action and identity politics based on race the demand for reparations despite the welfare system predominately geared towards blacks having spent trillion in the past years towards poverty costing times as much as all of america s wars since the revolution special considerations in academia like lowered admission standards or testing requirements even though more money is spent on additional education funding for black students than any other race and racial quotas hurting asian americans the desire to rid society of capitalism while hypocritically selling copious amounts of branded merchandise two parent households which has now quietly been removed due to criticism and the abolishment of police and prisons democrats and blm leaders have continually called for public violence including attacks on police and white folks with the demonization of white people as a sub human race and as racist demons compound this with the contrasting fact that nearly of the black community not only disagrees with the notion of defunding the police but a significant portion would like to see either the same amount or more police presence in their neighborhoods as anyone who grew up in a crime ridden black community knows such as myself a lack of policing only hurts the people that soft bellied liberals claim to want to help if any of the organizations and rioters actually cared about black lives mattering then they would be focusing on the real tragedies occurring within their own communities such as the uncontrolled black on black violence drug use and absentee fathers and not whatever viral case makes the news in order to further the political agenda the black community that actually deals with the rampant violence and gangs realize that defunding police is tantamount to forfeiting their lives and the lives of loved ones if the two tenants of the blm and antifa supporters are based on systemic racism and police brutality and both are built on misinformation and lies then what are all of the riots looting arson and murder actually for why as a society have we both allowed and endorsed these horrific actions to the point of normalcy why is it so difficult for liberals to disavow the actual closest things our generation has seen to nazism why does the violence inspired by the blm cause not count as extremism other than social bias of the people who believe in it despite glaringly obvious examples that say otherwise defenders would like to argue that just because these killers and anarchists believed in the blm narrative doesn t mean they have killed all those cops or trump supporters specifically for blm and just because people aren t card carrying members of antifa then obviously they aren t rioting specifically for antifa it s all just a magical coincidence that they buy their branded t shirts and wave their affiliated flags but yet if an individual police officer happens to kill a black man in the line of duty that s somehow representative of all officers and systemic racism according to these same groups we wouldn t excuse this type of behavior if it had been done in the name of isis we wouldn t judge an act of terrorism on whether or not it s followers actually traveled to syria before stabbing someone in the throat like logical intelligent human beings we would determine their guilt via their extremist beliefs and horrific actions which at this point is undeniable despite the feverish attempts to deny virtually all of it a relatively small list compared to all incidents of blm and antifa inspired attacks to follow when we have such divergent attitudes in the way the very cultures and people of various races approach life are we still feigning surprise that there s a difference in terms of wealth crime education economic or job status between races eventually we need to be honest and look at how people actually behave and how society functions instead of playing pretend and arguing about microagressions and white fragility allowing this toxic blm rhetoric continue in this state for political reasons is entirely the opposite of being respectful of other views and is a direct attack on democracy the sheer unfathomable damage done for this cause will go down in history as one of the worst decisions our society has ever inflicted upon itself perpetuated by the willful ideological delusion of one political side and its ever increasingly unstable base if there are any blm supporters still reading this i implore you to reconsider your stance you can be against racism and support the real black community without endorsing the hate and lies of the blm organization there is no requirement to martyr violent criminals just because they died while being black please if you re honestly trying to do what s best for society and the real black families adversely affected ensure you re not on the wrong side of history while doing it edit please feel free to copy and paste this information where you see fit i know not everyone interested in these conversations wants to do the leg work and a lot of the discussions revert back to the same topics crime rates demographics studies etc and rather than own a stupid reddit post i would rather see more people discussing the realities of this situation with the most concrete information study from michigan state university and the university of maryland via the proceedings of the national academy of sciences concluded we find no evidence of anti black or anti hispanic disparities across shootings and white officers are not more likely to shoot minority civilians than non white officers instead race specific crime strongly predicts civilian race this suggests that increasing diversity among officers by itself is unlikely to reduce racial disparity in police shootings and examination of national violent death reporting system data shows racial differences across types of fatal shootings black civilians fatally shot by police relative to white civilians are more likely to be unarmed and less likely to pose an immediate threat to officers in contrast white civilians relative to black civilians are nearly three times more likely to be fatally shot by police when the incident is related to mental health concerns and are seven times more likely to commit suicide by cop bonus points the vice president of research amp innovation at michigan was forced to resign partially due to his contrary findings that stated there was no racism in police shootings which was among his other racist science that some faculty and students found offensive study from michigan state and arizona state university concluded when adjusting for crime we find no systematic evidence of anti black disparities in fatal shootings fatal shootings of unarmed citizens or fatal shootings involving misidentification of harmless objects multiverse analyses showed only one significant anti black disparity of possible tests exposure to police given crime rate differences likely accounts for the higher per capita rate of fatal police shootings for blacks at least when analyzing all shootings for unarmed shootings or misidentification shootings data are too uncertain to be conclusive study from washington state university via american society of criminology concluded we found that despite clear evidence of implicit bias against black suspects officers were slower to shoot armed black suspects than armed white suspects and they were less likely to shoot unarmed black suspects than unarmed white suspects these findings challenge the assumption that implicit racial bias affects police behavior in deadly encounters with black suspects study from harvard via the national bureau of economic research concluded on the most extreme use of force officer involved shootings we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account we argue that the patterns in the data are consistent with a model in which police officers are utility maximizers a fraction of which have a preference for discrimination who incur relatively high expected costs of officer involved shootings follow up study from harvard via the national bureau of economic research concluded in stark contrast fryer forthcoming finds that conditional on a police interaction there are no racial differences in ois on either the extensive or intensive margins using data from houston texas where i have both ois and a randomly chosen set of interactions with police where lethal force may have been justified but was not used i find after controlling for suspect demographics officer demographics encounter characteristics suspect weapon and year fixed effects that blacks are percent less likely to be shot at by police relative to non black non hispanics investigating the intensive margin who shoots first in an encounter with police or how many bullets were discharged in the endeavor there are no detectable racial differences study from rutgars university and kookmin university and purdue college concluded this article aims to answer this question are white police officers more likely to use lethal force on minority suspects or people of a specific race to answer this question the authors construct a data set of all confirmed uses of lethal force by police officers in the united states in and they find that although minority suspects are disproportionately killed by police white officers appear to be no more likely to use lethal force against minorities than nonwhite officers study from the pacific institute of research and evaluation curtin university university of columbia found on average an estimated people were killed or medically treated for injury by law enforcement per stops arrests that ratio is surprisingly consistent by race ethnicity blacks have high arrest and stop rates and per capita are much more likely than whites to die at the hands of police however when blacks are stopped or arrested they are no more likely than whites to be injured or die during that incident consistent with our findings simulation studies find police are no more likely to fire on unarmed blacks than unarmed whites and high rates of black speeding citations per capita result from high violation rates a systematic review identified studies that found suspect race ethnicity did not predict use of force or its escalation however one study found blacks were more likely than whites to face force during compliance checks the ppcs survey also found that blacks were more likely to experience physical force and to perceive the threat of force during a stop although few respondents actually were injured by the force applied the large majority of incidents that those stopped perceived as undue force was stops where officers shouted at or threatened people presumably to deter resistance
