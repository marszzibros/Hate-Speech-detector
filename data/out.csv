4,"I find that I run into this argument a lot when discussing men's issues.

I don't really know how to handle this.  So far I have tried a few strategies.

**A. Acquiescing the point**

Usually adding, ""does that justify prejudice against males today?""

The results are fairly lukewarm at best, and it makes everyone feel uncomfortable.

**B. Challenging the point** 

What ends up happening here is a lot of anger and bitterness.  The person giving the point, usually a woman, seems to bristle, get angry, as though she actually lived in that time (which of course she did not).

If I challenge, I usually ask, ""how were women oppressed?""

The first answer is almost always Voting Rights.  This almost always goes unchallenged.  

But really, the truth to this is a longer and more complicated.  Most people don't seem to realize that 100 years ago, in Canada anyway, most *people* did not have the right to vote.  The history on this is complicated and differs from region to region, and this usually bogs down the entire conversation.  People start pulling out their phones and stuff.  I'd rather avoid this. 

Voting rights were generally tied to property rights.  In Canada, in 1917, only 1 in 5 men had the right to vote.  In order to entice more boys to go to war, voter's rights were extended to those who signed up for the army (women got the right to vote a year later).  

That point *never* goes unchallenged when I have brought it up.  It is *always* a major point of contention.

I often ask the rhetorical question: ""Would you rather go to war and die face down in the muck in a ditch?  Or not have the right to vote?""

Incredulously, the answer I usually get is, ""oh well, at least men had the right to choose.""  

Which...  I don't even know how to respond to that.  I frankly think that is one of the most ridiculous arguments I've ever heard in my life.  I don't even know where to begin with that.

The correct answer of course *should be*, ""I don't want to go to war.  Especially WWI, which is literally as close to hell on earth as we can possibly imagine.""

Yet somehow, that point rarely ever gains any traction.  (""It was their choice to go to a war that MEN started anyway."")

After that, the conversation invariably goes to ""women were property of their husband"".

Now first of all, is that even true?  Does that depend on the region or...?

Second, what does that even mean?  On some level when two people enter into a marriage contract, do they not somehow ""belong"" to each other?  Do women ""own"" men when they enter into a marriage agreement today?  (There is some argument to be made here about divorce and custody rights for men).

Thirdly, men owned other men too.  And wives of men owned other men (slaves) too.  Are we forgetting that men were slaves too?

Should we even go down this rabbit hole?  Every time we do, it completely derails the conversation, and everyone sitting at the table looks guilty and embarrassed.  Which is not the intended effect.

As you can see, Option #B opens up a veritable can of worms that usually ends up derailing any productive conversation we were having before.

C.**We weren't even living at that time**

This should be the end of the argument right there.  But for some reason, it never seems to hit the mark with people.

I usually say something like if we were living in that time, and I agreed that there was a gender imbalance in society, I hope that I would help.  I'm a person who is all about equal rights.  I hope that I would aid on that front whenever possible.

But we're not living in that era.  And I have absolutely nothing to do with that.  Why am I responsible for questions of the past?

""Well, you're not.  But because it happened (unchallenged), it justifies advantages for women, and oppression of men today.  The pendulum.""

The conversation usually fizzles after this, as most people generally agree with this sentiment.

**Conclusion:**

And if we choose Option #A and acquiesce the point, we cede the moral high ground.  If we choose Option #B, we open up a more complicated and convoluted conversation from which there is no turning back.  If we choose Option #C, it usually ends the conversation without anything productive coming out of it.

All have the desired effect that a feminist is trying to achieve, which is silencing through intimidation.

It might be stated that this is Feminism's greatest trick of all - changing historical truths, then pushing the narrative in our education system.  *By making women victims of the past justifies advantages they have today, even at the expense of boys who had absolutely nothing to do with that oppression.*

6,"I like Peterson, agree with most of his views on political correctness, SJW's etc., but I've been underwhelmed by his arguments about the earnings gap.  

I haven't watch all of his TV appearances -- and his interviews are often butchered by editors -- but in any case he seems to focus primarily on biological differences between the sexes.   For example he'll argue that women are more agreeable and risk-averse on average, and will therefore be less likely to negotiate for raises; or he'll argue that women have different life priorities on average, and will therefore want to spend more time with their families.   

These arguments are all true and should indeed be discussed in the context of the gender earnings gap.   The problem is that they are not going to resonate with anyone except evolutionary biologists and people on the right.   

People on the left (especially women) will counter ""women shouldn't be punished for their biology.   I'm no communist, but we can make things more fair.""   

You know what WOULD resonate with people on the left?   To challenge feminist arguments *on their own terms*: we should say, ""yeah, let's talk about fairness.""   

(a) Men WORK LONGER HOURS.   I think it's about 20 hours more per week on average.   Is is fair to pay a man and woman the same amount if the man is working twenty hours more per weak?   Isn't that the OPPOSITE of ""egalitarian"" economics?   Wouldn't that entail the exploitation of male workers?   

(b) Men work almost all of the dangerous jobs.   Why are you not concerned with the workplace death gap?   Is it fair to pay a man working an extremely dangerous job the same amount as a woman who works in a comfortable office?   Whatever happened to the left's focus on workplace safety?   Why are you more concerned with a millionaire actress earning slightly less than her costar than you are the very lives of working class men?  

(c) Why are men not being given an equal amount of state services?   Especially when they work longer hours and pay the majority of taxes?   Why is so much more money devoted to breast cancer than prostate cancer?   Why should women receive scholarships when they make up the majority of university students?   Why are male victims of domestic violence not being offered any services?   Why are homeless women being given free housing (see Vancouver) when men make up the vast majority of rough sleepers?  Etc. Etc. 

(d) Are you aware that for most men, work is not an enjoyable activity, and that they simply don't have the luxury of relying on romantic partners to shoulder the burden?   That most men are in fact sacrificing quality of life to support their families?   That most men would love to be able to spend more time with their children?   That in some cases men have no choice but to work longer hours (and therefore earn more money) because they will be sent to prison if they don't pay alimony?   

(e) Women control the majority of consumer spending.   When party A creates value through their labor, and party B spends the money, who is actually being exploited in this relationship?   Doesn't this scenario actually resemble traditional leftist ideas about capitalism?   Ie that one party earns the money and another spends it?  [no need to agree with this interpretation, just drawing an analogy]

These arguments would be much more effective in challenging feminists on the earnings gap than talking about biology.

7,"Hey guys. I want to first say that finding this sub was so helpful to me; at a time when people wanted to make a demon out of me, I find this place a refreshing reminder of my humanity.

Here's my ordeal. I spent 3 years with a girl and over the course of that relationship, we had an amazing time. There were ups and downs of course and mistakes were made, but a lovely relationship overall. However it ran its course and we ended it after a short time apart. Ultimately we wanted our careers so that was that. We were on friendly terms for about 3/4 months, swapping messages and snapchats.

But it all changed about 4 months after we broke up. Her tone changed. Her friends have since spread rumours that I'm a rapist and she has called me sexually abusive. She cites elements of our sex life that I'd believed were consensual and mutually enjoyed as having been abuse. I even reviewed our entire text and fb message history, and like I say, everything we tried was mutual according to her. However things that she said she wanted to 'keep trying' and 'get better at' have now been turned around against me. I even found times I was saying 'We don't have to do *this or that* if you don't want to' and her response being 'No I enjoy those things' (for the record this is nothing illegal or dark, just the different things you try when you're in a long term relationship.

What I really wasn't ready for was the revisionism. Girls who I hooked up with years earlier decided to sympathize with her despite friendships with me in the intervening time, and no mention ever of me being abusive or pushy.

It's been bizarre. I was a sexually active guy in my young years but this accusation has warped people's opinions on me. I'm not perfect; I've absolutely fucked up in the past and reacted badly to stressful situations. But this has taken all of my human qualities and just magnified them 100%. It's tough, honestly.

8,"I had this idea based on my personal difficulty with finding proper representation in my child custody case.

**Problem statement:** we understand there is a lot of gender bias inherent in the family court system. However what a lot of people might not realize is the bias is expressed in the form of attorneys, as opposed to poorly written laws or bad judges.

Example: if a man and woman divorce, the father really wants his kid(s) 50% of the time, and the mother basically wants full custody with marginal visitation (let's assume 15% time with the father). The mother finds an attorney willing to argue for 15%. The father finds an attorney who basically says ""you just can't get 50%, let's try to fight for 25%."" Now whether the father's attorney *wins* or not the father still gets inequal parenting time, but it's not because of a biased judge or law it's because the attorney was unwilling to fight for equality and chose an easier path instead.

**Suggested solution:** start a project that collects information about how attorneys are arguing cases with the intent of creating a database that shows which are friendly to fathers' right, such that a newly divorcing man can access and the to find suitable legal council.

Possible methods of aquiring information: self-reporting from various men going through divorce/custody battle. Via calling/email campaign to various law offices to ask how they handle specific cases. Perhaps there is a method to gleam data from public records in some jurisdictions.

I don't believe this project would be very helpful in the early period, it would take a large amount of time to gather and correlate that much information in a way that makes it helpful to the average Joe.

13,"Hey folks,

I find myself in the middle of a custody battle to get my son for an equal time. I feel that the legal system has let me down. A quick background, the mother of my son (11months old) was emotionally abusive to me, withholding affection, making me feel inadequate, etc. We split while she was still pregnant, she completely cut me out of the pregnancy once I couldn't afford to continue to pay her bills (have paid over $20k, we were only together for 7 months). Once he was born, I didn't find out about him for 6 days, she wouldn't let me visit my son without supervision and only at her home, ""In case I became aggressive again"". There is no history of violence from me, in fact, many times I have been praised for my patience and ability to remain calm while in distress. We went into a contested trial, during that she made claims that I was emotionally and physically abusive towards her. And when she wouldn't ""give me"" sex I would get physically abusive. This was all disproved in court (I suggest everyone keep a log of text messages and emails). she also made the claim that I also was emotionally and physically abusive towards her other 3 children, this was said without any evidence. From this trial, there was an interim order laid down that I get my son every 2nd day for 2 hours to accommodate his need for breastmilk. At this point, he is only 3 months old. 

Fast forward 4 months we have an informal meeting with a judge, from that she is firmly encouraged to express breast milk for him to feed during my time. Prior to this she ""forbid"" me to feed him. We are now 6 months since that last time in court, we have no progress I only see my son 2 hours every 2nd day. The mother won't entertain me having any more time with my son, she has never been able to give me a reason as to why. I am preparing to go back to court to get what's right. And for myself I feel ""right"" is that my son gets equal time with both his parents.

What I'm looking for here is a support group in Winnipeg, Canada. I have been in this fight since Dec 2016, my tank is empty. I have a great group of friends but I don't feel they fully understand the amount of stress that comes from something like this. I was hoping to find a group of dad's who may have gone through similar trauma.

14,"I recall reading a paper or blog post that looked at the typical masculinity inventories (beginning, if I recall correctly, with BEM, developed in 1974) used in social science research. Over time, these inventories seem to have quietly dropped what might be considered ""masculine virtues"" (leadership, competence, ambition, confidence) from the list of traits tied to masculinity, and are now almost completely about violence, aggression, sexual conquest and irresponsibility, and control over women. 

That is, they have evolved from a mixed bag of positive and negative norms into something that is almost completely negative.

(I left out the sub name and writer so not to have my post removed for brigading.) 

&amp;nbsp;


Historically, a minority of men reproduced. If porn is one of the many things that distract and keeps inferior men out of the reproductive pool, then good?
&amp;nbsp;
When I said ""shitty real-life partners"" I may have been speaking from the perspective of a certain group of men, the ""Rejected"". There are a lot of men ""quitting"", good? They are weak. Men who say ""fuck your rules"" have always been naturally more attractive to mate with. So if fear of the new laws causes certain males to ""chill out"" or not even make an effort, then good?
&amp;nbsp;

It is quite possible that everything that is happening, the insanity of our court system, may be entirely organic and what needs to occur to keep the pool clean.
&amp;nbsp;
With technology headed in the current direction, we may be branching into a time where we have the smallest percentage of males reproduce in known human history.

Not that there is anything wrong with anything I wrote above. 

Anyways.... I don't really have the best GPA. I still am a scientist and still want to get my science courses done but most of college is a lot of busy work. Even the labs are less hands on than what I would prefer. 

There is no experimentation allowed. No ""fun"" allowed. Yes, I know in stuff like chemistry that's not really a good idea, messing with chemicals is frowned upon. 

But in stuff like math or physics labs why not? Its all like baking a cake. No fun. Big long report you write before the lab. Big long report you write afterwards. 

When I do my own experiments (outside of school) I make them at least a bit more fun and entrepreneurial. Stuff like testing the breaking point of stuff I try to make different structures. Double blind tests etc. 

For school, yes some of it is like a job in the same field. Most of medicine and science is paperwork... But the experimental aspects are gone by highschool. !00% dead by college. 

Last term I was in an Ochem lab. I kinda liked Ochem. The lab was horrible though. There were just monotonous stuff.

I might as well have been a robot. All I need in all of these classes is raw memorization and that's it. 

That also was why I was better than lots of people in the actual problem-solving classes. The answers weren't what you had to memorize. They were what you made for them. 

I also think that this is why women really really excel in lots of previously men dominated fields. The fields are basically mechanized at this point. You have a clip-board. You do what is on the clip board. You memorize it, you do it. and on and on.

Counselor 1 tells wife that she has to let go of control or our marriage is doomed. I should’ve saw this as foreshadowing.  She gets so offended at this that she quits this counselor  and refuses to go. 

Wife then gives me a demand. In order to prove to her that our marriage is first.  I must be willing to give up some
time with child 1. I told her this would break my heart and hurt the child. She told me there is no compromise. I agree on the one exception that we continue counseling and only for a temporary time because a child deserve to be in a home with no hostility.  

She quits counseling and the fights continue. She does not like me leaving to go visit my Daughter and tells me that I’m not putting her first. She puts a demand down that my child is no longer allowed in her house under any circumstances. 

Enter child 2. #imanidiot. She is pregnant. When she doesn’t get her way she starts to physically confront me.  She goes as far as to punch me in the face. I should have filed a police report then. 

Things continue to escalate and she continues to confront me about spending my legal time with my child 1.  I beg for her to go to counseling and she still refuses. at one point it’s obvious she is out for blood. She called the police on me once because I threw a pair of blue jeans at the door (not at her) in frustration. Police obviously did not take me in. Just wrote report for standard procedure. 

She starts to sick her family on me when she is mad at me. Whenever she is mad at me, like clockwork I expect calls from her family chewing me out. I tell her I feel isolated because I’m in a strange town with no friends or family.  And always ganged up on. 

It’s at this point that I move to another room
To avoid confrontation.  I tell her that unless she is willing to go to counseling with me then I just cannot talk. On my way home last night I had a really scared feeling like I needed to start protecting myself. I changed the locks on the room I was in. I woke up at 530 to her ramming the door as hard she could ( at 7 months pregnant mind you). I bet her to stop and start recording. What happens next is madness. I let her in an attempt to de escalate. She starts throwing stuff at me and pours water all over my stuff and me. I sit there and take it and beg her to stop while I’m videotaping the entire time. I called the police immediately and just filed a report. 

Going to talk to a lawyer ASAP.  The police were immediately suspicious of me and consoling of her. They screamed for me show my hands and not move. I am muscled tattooed dude,  so if they chose a photo shop picture for domestic abuse, I’m sure I would look like that dude. I felt so sad and disheartened. Listening to
Them joke with her in the living room
While I’ve tried to go by the book throughout this.  This is why I locked my doors. I was hiding from her and trying to avoid confrontation.  They told me I was welcome to file charges and handed me a paper to call and casually went on their way. 


This is just a flaming pike of crap of a situation. 

Any advice? Anyone been here?

28,"  After writing about the smart feminists I decided to share a story I have remembered. I remember 4 years ago when I was in high school I had a project about inequality. One of the questions apart of the assignment was ''Which gender in your opinion faces the most inequality?'' At that time I did not know men faced inequality. My mom and dad were getting stuff ready for a vacation we had planned and saw what I was doing. They said ''WOMEN! Men have all the rights but women are still treated unfairly!'' I decided to write that down because it made sense at the time. The next day we were turning in the work when our FEMALE teacher shared her opinion because that was apart of the lesson plan. She said in quotes '' I think men are the most unequal gender. Woman have plenty of support while men are told to just deal with it. Men also are most likely to lose children in custody battles. That is not all men also get longer prison sentences and are most likely to die first. There also is no testicular cancer awareness month when there is a breast cancer month. I was indeed a feminist and I believed that men had all the power but when my son told me that his best friend since kinder raped him him I did not believe him. I decided to look deeper and found some very upsetting stuff. I decided to talk to my girlfriends about it but they just ignored it. I also decided to share this at a feminist conference thing nearby but I was kicked out for ''violence''. I thought it was about equality but I was wrong.'' 

High school me was shocked and this was the first thing that made me want to be apart of the mensrights movement. Thank you past english teacher that opened my eyes with only a few sentences.",8hiwxu,disney04,1525646542,91,MensRights,0.25462922,0.1505596,0.01750142

A little background she comments a lot on what i can provide for her, owning a home etc. Im theonly income in the house. When my daughter was born 3lbs 6 ounces due to my wife hiding her bulimia from me and claiming her pregnancy just made her sick. She later admitted she was purging while pregnant and essentially starving our little girl. After she was born my wife stayed in the hospital lying to doctors about her medical problems and the first 3 months i stayed home from work taking care of our little girl on my own. After she came home i took care of her still on my own, i travel for work and when i get home her job stops and my begins. I clean i take care of the house and my daughter while still working while my wife sits on her phone. Now onto what happened, she was attacking my intelligence out of no where and calling me names like big man and shit like that. I tried to tell her how she was talking to me was disgusting and she needed to admit that she is calling me names. She was looking at her phone and talking shit so at this point i fucked up and took her phone. She came at me and i got away back to my room. At this point she followed me got in my face and the insults continued. I stood my ground and she grabbed me, i then pushed her off of me and she cut my arm and hand, im still not sure how. She then left and i called the cops. At this point i was grilled bullied and they attempted to get me to admit to things i didnt do including and i quote ""pummeling her"" i told them to look at my hands and they didnt want to look. My wife left without even a bruise while i was bleeding. I was then told to leave my house and my little girl with someone i now deem violent. Im depressed very sore and scared for my daughter.

First time poster here. I Just want to clarify one thing. 

It really doesn't matter how a woman chooses to dress when it comes to all forms of sexual assault. I.e, it ought not to be accepted as a line of defense for the accused. Are we all in agreement with that? 

I don't care if a woman is walking around in nothing but a thong, that is an excuse to be sexually assaulted, right? 

Note that I am not talking about the natural urge to glance at women who are dressed in less clothing, that's fine and perfectly natural, and the opposite is true as well (women glancing at men dressed in less clothing during the summer etc).

36,"I’m male.

I’ve spent about a month in r/MensRights. It became almost addicting to read. I’ve also posted here a few times.

First, some background on my views on “men’s rights”: In the United States, evidence would point to the favoring of women in certain legal, economic and social situations, in my opinion. But I think that these select inequities are mere byproducts of thousands of years of strict gender roles. So men do lose in some situations for being male, but despite the story the the numbers seem to tell, I think that there is no substantial evidence to show real systemic discrimination against men.

I think that my opinions on “men’s rights” shouldn’t diminish the credibility of my opinions on the community, but there ya go anyways.

NOW:

First: Women are and have always been discriminated against in almost every culture on the planet, forever. By men. It was, to me, incredible that anyone could contest this, yet I found waves of internet-spawned “historians” in r/MensRights always primed with some nebulous historical example that seemed to demonstrate that WOMEN were, in fact, the true oppressor class and that the history so fundamental to our education was all wrong. Saying that women have been oppressed doesn’t mean that men haven’t; BUT, The key difference is that women have been oppressed by men, whereas men have been oppressed by themselves. Today this is much less of an issue.

The Problems That I Have With This Sub, and Why The MRM Can Never Be Taken Seriously In Any Academic Setting:

1. Although race should play no part in a purely gendered debate, I have found incredible levels of racism present here. I’m not going to argue about this one because it’s not deniable.
2. The Incel movement that killed 10 in Toronto is alive and well here! Incel themed posts are frequent occurrences. Now, I’m not saying that everyone here condones it, or even most people, but its presence is too great to ignore.
3. Arguing for men’s rights is fine. Hating feminism is something that I find misguided but understandable. But misogyny is prevalent here. It’s pervasive.

I think that almost everyone that is subscribed to r/MensRights should invest in reading a liberal news source (the fakest of fake news!). I would recommend The Atlantic, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Huffington Post, or NPR. The more foul, disagreeable, and truly evil you think it is, the better. As long as you’re receiving informed beliefs contrary to your own. Uniformity of ideas leads to true indoctrination.

40,"[Full disclosure: I tried posting this question on the Jordan Peterson subreddit but got a single (low quality) response. I'm hoping the users here are better informed to help me with my question]

In his interview with Jordan Peterson the first thing he cited when it came to the benefits of having fathers around for outcomes of children was the idea that children with father's are much better at delaying gratification (which we know is associated with a ton of long term positive life outcomes).

Does anybody who knows the literatures or these arguments in more depth know whether this claim has ever been shown to be the result of the fathers being present in the children's lives or could it not just as plausibly be the result of the following...

The ability to defer gratification is at least partly a genetic trait... people who are better at defering gratification are better at maintaining long term relationships and marriages--not getting divorced. Therefore children who are born into a world with stable two parents are more likely to have a genetic disposition for deferred gratification like their parents.

Another point Farrell brought up was that children rasied by fathers were less likely to exhibit ADHD...

The same question applies: surely fathers who do the childcare are not a random sample of the population. They are likely to be quite responsible, and probably lower on average at exhibition ADHD... if ADHD is partly genetic you'd expect the children of fathers who stay at home and raise kids to be less likely to have ADHD than mothers who stay at home which ist he more default and society-accepted default role...

I hope these questions make sense. What I would like to learn is that if these things have been factored into these findings? Have the findings been shown to hold when genetic factors are taken into account? For example, are children from stable families where the father dies from an accident leaving a widowed mother more likely to develop ADHD or become worse at delaying gratification? Might intuition would be no but would like to be proved wrong.",8iewxy,everydayadrawing,1525959293,9,MensRights,0.030388435,0.015568925,0.006977591

But what if the majority of feminists, were actually decent people that we could work together with to further equality for everyone?

Now, I am not saying that we go full r/menslib. But I feel that we can learn from places like r/femradebates. I personally have been talking to quite a few decent feminists on different platforms. They are nice people, and agree with many of our positions.

We do not see our role as one that should ever promote conflict or distress and have, therefore, decided to not proceed with the forum.
&gt;Lifeline’s mission is to support all Australians in crisis and to do so in a non-judgemental and respectful manner. We do hope that you understand our decision regarding this event and that you continue to support Lifeline and our vision for an Australia free of suicide.""

This is a model action on other issues. I'm sure many other people wrote to LifeLine, and here is an extract from my letter to them:

&gt;""Dear Madam
Lifeline’s association with Clementine Ford is incompatible with your values, your mission, and your obligation “to act in good faith, with a reasonable degree of care and diligence, in the charity’s best interests and pursuing its purpose”
I understand that Lifeline plans to support an event “Recognise, Respond, Refer” to be held on May 29th in Melbourne, and that Clementine Ford is scheduled to be a participant on the panel. I believe that this association is in breach of your statutory obligation “to act in good faith, with a reasonable degree of care and diligence, in the charity’s best interests and pursuing its purpose”.
I intend to raise this breach with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission on Wednesday 9th May. As their protocol for complaints requires that issues are raised with the charity in the first instance, this email is to exercise this obligation and to maximise the chance of involving the Commission. This is the second time I have contacted you, and the text of my initial email sent on 2nd May is included as Appendix A

&gt;There are three elements to the case:
1. Clementine Ford has made public statements advocating that men should kill themselves. It is not a matter of conjecture that she has publicly exhorted men to commit suicide.

&gt;2. Lifeline’s association with someone who advocates that men should kill themselves is incompatible with your obligation to act “in good faith” and “in the charities best interests” and by associating with her you are undermining your raison d’etre.

&gt;3. Lifeline’s association with someone who advocates that men should kill themselves is incompatible with your own mission, values and principles, and is an egregious breach of your own governance framework.""

The learning point is that an argument about the merits of Clementine Ford as a speaker is a matter of conjecture, while a breach of the charity's own governance is easier to prove. The threat of escalation to the Charity Commission is one that I will follow through with. I will post the address here so other MRAs can join in complaining to the Charity Commission.

I suspect that Lifeline will regroup and re-engage with Ford in some other way. This is a great day for Adam Smith (whoever you are) and everyone who stood up for what is right, what is true, and what is real.

It's just a thought i got after reading the some of the ""controversial sorted"" posts in r/relationships .

There is a shocking amount of women who clearly state at the beginning of a relationship, they want to be married after a set timeline or thr will leave the relationship. 

I'm asking myself how can you be able to do so? I married my girlfriend at our 9 year mark and we never set some arbitrary timeline because we thought it's important that we get married to EACH OTHER.

Is this maybe a US thing? I'm living in Germany and maybe here things are a little bit different.

59,"*Some basic facts:*

- I'm from Connecticut
- I have a lawyer helping me, but he will likely not be present at the hearing
- My ex cheated on me and lied for months
- We were together nearly 6 years, but never married
- I moved out into a better home in a better town (about 7 weeks ago)
- I currently have my daughter more often than she does
- I was primary caregiver the last two years
- I stepped down from my job so my ex could pursue her career (what a mistake that was, I believe I was set up)
- I have a new job that I began 3 weeks into this process (about a month and a half ago), I work weekends when I don't have my daughter with me
- My ex makes about double the income I do (based on future projection)
- My income is supplemented by my mother for now while I recover
- I filed for sole custody and child support last week, she's being served today
- She promised to help for ""a handful of months"" but stopped after the first month (I recorded her saying this)
- She introduced her lover to my child on week 4 or 5
- He lost his job 3 weeks ago and may be living with her
- My daughter knows he's a ""sleepover friend""
- They both smoke weed daily and I've found pills in her car in the past
- He may do harder drugs, has posted online about suicide multiple times and appears to be bipolar
- She has a copy of my bank card and has been using it to buy alcohol and cigarettes (cigarettes daily, alcohol twice in one week)
- The money in that account is supposed to be child support, it's a joint account she is supposed to transfer money into
- She locked me out of the bank app by changing the password so I'd have to go to the bank or pay at an atm just to see the balance
- My daughter is 4
- She's on her mother's health insurance
- I have her Tuesday (afternoon) to Friday, one of our mom's has her Saturday, and my ex takes her Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday before school, I sleep at my mom's house when she has her
- She shares my last name and I am named the father on her birth certificate
- She often says she does not want to see her mother
- There have been days she was with my ex and did not eat until dinner time
- She knows this was her mother's decision, and tells strangers ""my mommy made us leave""
- She wakes up at night (constantly) crying, and comes into my room; She's extremely confused and distraught and often ""shuts down"" periodically throughout the day and has thrown up from nerves several times

*What I've done so far/have as evidence she's a poor mother:*

- Kept a calendar for all the time I've had my daughter, she's had my daughter, and how many times she's been late to pick her up on 'her days' (many, especially the first few weeks)
- Recorded original negotiations with my ex, have her on it calling child support ""an allowance"" and saying she will not give me it; admitting to buying $200 worth of 'dabs'; swearing and yelling at me throughout the process and telling me to 'go fuck myself' after I say I'll ""try to be nice throughout this process"" (I kept calm the entire time, never raised my voice or cursed)
- Took photos of the house while it was under her care (when I had to take trips to pick up my property, two separate weeks); total mess, clothes piled up, dishes piled up, toys everywhere, ash tray in the house, nearly empty liquor bottle ($40 Jack Daniels)
- Texts from **her** best friend griping about my ex's parenting, and how she's absorbed in her phone when she brings my daughter to play with hers and how she has to feed her because my ex rarely ever provides food
- Texts from my ex stating it's ""hard to see any father daughter duo"" because of her own father's death 14 years ago.
- A note from the school teacher because my ex sent my daughter to school in a turtle neck and long pants on an 86 degree day, I have the clothes as well
- Bank statements showing she used my account multiple times (she replenished some of it, but not all)
- I'm getting a reference note from my boss stating my work ethic and job security (he thinks I'm the best, and I've only been there about 6 weeks, and only work weekends and Mondays (12-15 hour shifts), recently picked up Friday nights
- I'm signing up for the mandatory parenting classes this week


My primary concern is getting custody and having my residence be her's. I have my daughter 4 out of 5 school days and she starts kindergarten this year. Her pre-school teacher has been helping me and has unregistered her from the school district (it's auto enrollment). I'm going to ask the teacher for a reference letter as well, stating how I've acted and how my ex has acted. I've kept a dialogue with her as this process affects my daughter's behavior (she's cried in school several times), my ex has not.
Child support is secondary. I need it to ensure my daughter's quality of life is maintained.


I need to win. I do not know if I have enough, and I do not know what my ex will bring (or possibly lie about). What I do know is I was never abusive to her, not physically or verbally, never cheated, did not waste money, am not an addict of any kind, and put every effort into raising our daughter right. I believe my ex has/had PPD and most definitely suffers from Chronic Depression. I want her to get therapy and have brought it up many times, but I do not believe she will do it without being forced. Also, I want her lover drug tested, and if possible, I don't ever want that scumbag around my daughter again.

65,"Hmmmm...I wonder if that's part of the problem?    Every feminist seems to have a different idea of what ""feminism"" is, to the point where Feminist A and Feminist B will have opposing viewpoints on any given gender issue.   

Take prostitution.  Feminists seem to be evenly split into three camps: (1) prostitution should be illegal (2) prostitution should be legal (3) prostitution should be illegal only for the buyer 

There is no fucking consistency.   

How many times have we seen feminists come onto this sub and claim that *that other feminist* isn't a *real* feminist?   How are we supposed to know who the real feminist is when you can't fucking agree on anything?   

I think the incoherence is a defining feature not a bug.   Everything is a based on a what a woman *feels* about a particular issue.  Since feminists (knowingly or unknowingly) reject logic and facts they are unable to establish rules.    

One could argue that there *is* an underlying logic to feminism: if it harms men and boys it's good.   That's really all I can come up with.   

It's not about helping women.   I know this because there have been numerous cases of feminists explicitly opposing legislation that would help women -- if it also helped men.   Shared parenting is a good example.   All of the studies show that it helps all parties -- the children, the father, and yes the mother -- but NOW opposes it.  

And speaking of motherhood, yes Natalie, there are rules to being a good mother.   Don't abuse your child, for example.   Don't deny your children contact with their father.   Don't mollycoddle them and deny them autonomy as they grow up.   These *should* be rules but they aren't, thanks to feminism.

66,"""My husband [26m] and I [26f] have been married 4 years, together for 8, and have known each other for even longer. I feel like I can't rely on him as a partner for the rest of my life.

When we first started dating, he was working hard to make enough money to put himself through college without loans. He was motivated and driven. He picked his major based on what would pay the most and have a large job market but it turns out that he hates it. Every job he's had post-graduation has made him miserable, but I'm not sure if it's the work or culture.

My husband has always had trouble with authority. He doesn't like being told what to do, especially when he disagrees with whatever is being asked of him. In the corporate world, the people above you ask you to do things and meet certain expectations. He tends to speak his mind when he disagrees, which causes conflict at work. In my opinion it's important to know when to hold your tongue, but he says I'm just a sheep. He also has a problem with sleeping in and missing work. He got fired from his last job, though he laughed about it. He told me he thinks it's because he told them what he thinks could be improved, but they fired him for misconduct.

He has been out of work for 6 months. Financially we are okay, but I'm starting to feel it. I told him I need him to show me he is motivated and cares about his work, but he says I have unreasonable expectations because he will never be like me.

When he lost his job, he told me he was looking for work, but did not start looking until 2 or 3 months later. I had to break down about him lying in order to find out he decided he just needed a break and planned to start looking after two months. Whenever I would bring it up, he would get angry and tell me he was looking and didn't need nagged. He has told me white lies a few other times as well when he thinks he can get away with it and it'll get me off of his back. On the bright side, he's looking now, but I think he sleeps, surfs the internet, and plays games most of the day -- though he will disagree.

A few months ago I told him that I expect him to clean the house and cook dinner. He has cooked a handful of times and only cleans when his friends come over every other weekend. He says he doesn't need to cook that much because we didn't much when we were both working.

He also has trouble communicating. He doesn't like to think or talk about feelings, and doesn't believe in saying sorry, because it means nothing. He also has a temper he has been improving, but every few months he will get angry at his video games and scream and hit or throw things. Never at me, but it's still scary.

I'm aware that everyone has flaws that come up when you're in a long term relationship. I have been trying to be supportive. I've encouraged him to look for a different type of work that might make him happier, but he doesn't think anything viable will. I'm running out of emotional support and no longer respect him. I feel like I can't rely on him for anything. He says he's not depressed and though I have threatened divorce and asked him to book counseling appointments while I'm at work, he has not. I'm just not sure what I'm getting out of this anymore.

When is it okay to say I've had enough?

Tl;dr: I can't rely on my husband to hold down a job, take care of the house, provide emotional support, or tell me the truth about small things. I'm at my wits end but feel like I'm supposed to be supportive of him until (if) things get better.""",8jugcq,lovemyusername,1526473120,3,MensRights,0.112643376,0.04442204,0.00814271

71,"I'm writing this with a throwaway account, as I'm in the middle of a custody trial for equal custody of my son, I wanted to have a little anonymity.

I've been subscribed to a few subreddits dealing with all sorts of gender issues. I've learned a lot about what gender rights mean to different groups. I've also noticed that every group also has their assholes, people who are just looking for a fight. 

So here is my little opinion of gender issues,  I don't think any gender is better than the other from a broad strokes view. We each have our strengths and we each have our weaknesses. Granted these aren't universal statements. I fully support equal opportunity, everyone should have the same chances as the person next to them. I'm all for that. Where I struggle is changing the criteria to achieve the same outcome. Compare apples to apples. In my humble opinion having different criteria based on what is between your legs is a step backward in human equality. I support equal opportunity but not artificially creating an equal outcome. 

Now the topic of compliments, I work primarily with women. I'm a business owner the majority of our clients are female. I have developed relationships with some of our clients, and have learned that perversion is gender blind. When the barriers between acquaintance and friendship are lowered you get a pretty good view of what the other side thinks. I have heard women talk about how they just need to get laid, much the same way my friends and I have talked like that. I have heard of women dating a guy for a free meal, I must admit I don't know any male friends who have done that. I have been sat on and accused of being over dramatic when I express dislike for it. I have been accused of being gay because I didn't want to see someone's boobs. As I write this I'm sure many of you are wondering what I do for work, I honestly can't fully explain it without blowing my cover. But the vague answer is that women pay my company money to get themselves ready for boudoir photo shoots. Now back to the topic of compliments, sorry I went way off course, compliments are awesome. I know when I go out of my comfort zone and wear something different, it feels great when someone makes a positive remark. The same should go for both genders if someone deserves a compliment give it. I remember through high school being called creepy because I was comfortable complimenting a women. I do remember a time when I was frustrated and commented that perhaps I'm not creepy but in fact they aren't comfortable taking a compliment. A few years later she admitted to me that she liked the little things I noticed about her and in fact she wasn't comfortable telling me that, so instead answered with negative comments. 

I understand that I'm just ranting now, but this is actually very helpful for me to vent. I'm in the middle of what i feel is an infringement on my human right to be a parent.

72,"I'm a proud men's rights activist and I am also a gay man. My friends in the movement tell me that I'm something of an anomaly. While they are happy that I'm a part of the movement they rightly point out that I will probably never have to worry about false accusations or child custody nightmares. Furthermore, I was never subjected to genital mutilation and I can circulate freely among women without fear of being perceived as a predator/bank book. 

That's a great question and I'm not entirely sure how to answer it except to say that this movement speaks to something very deep within myself. 

I grew up without a father or father figure and was far removed from any healthy male peer groups. In recent years, I've come to realize how badly I've needed (platonic) male companionship. I'll never know the love of a father but I can forge healthy and meaningful relationships with other men thanks in large part to the men's movement which has given me the space to honestly discuss these issues.

76,"MRA is important and it definitely serves a valid purpose. However, all we actually are is pro equality. The reason that we call ourselves MRA is because we understand that males face more discrimination and lack many of the rights that women have.

For example, the right to vote (military draft laws), the right to not be forcibly mutilated (circumcision laws), the right to equal prison sentences / belief as a victim of abuse (Duluth model, UK courts bias, India courts bias, domestic violence laws in spain, infanticide laws in Australia, Canada, and Argentina) right to privacy (male only groups, schools and work places no longer exist. This is only a problem if female only spaces are allowed. I say both should be allowed but that's an irrelevant opinion, equality is the aim regardless of which direction it goes to be achieved) the right to equal support (domestic violence shelters).

We all know the issues involved. Its rather clear however on this sub that all we want is equality. As we all know feminism is often falsely associated with equality. MRA is the true equality movement.

I propose a new movement ERA / ERM (Equal Rights Activists / Movement).

I advise that someone makes a new sub called ERM and links it to this sub. We should all be active in both subs. This sub can be a clear, all inclusive stand for equality. Gender or race is separate from the title.

MRA is already ERM anyway. However if we create a new sub called ERM then I feel that it would make our position far more clear. Anyone that supports true equality can then become an ERA.

This movement would grow very quickly IMO and people who are confused about feminism, labelling themselves as one as they are confused by the definition of equality should wake up to this. If we have a feminist arguing with an MRA at the minute it looks like a gender argument to an outsider, however they will see if for what it is if a feminist is arguing with an ERA. A feminist arguing against equality. That is already the case now. I feel that a new movement / title to add to our current one will help the cause.

I support all human rights. I do not support feminism because it does not support me.

ERM would support everyone's equality. This would be clear in the title.

If anyone is interested in creating a new sub with this title, please post a link in the comments and I will add it to this post (with an edit) I will be the first to join.

77,"On mothers day I went to see my grandma. Shes been divorced 3 times (currently married to my step-grandpa) in her life. She is not a feminist but her views on Tiger Woods were just... horrible to me.

She hates the guy and when she saw him on the TV because the tour was on she said that he is one of the worst people ever because he cheated on his wife. 

That was years ago for reference and he never dated her lol.

I told her that his wife hit him with a putter (I think, not confirmed or convicted. Not relevant one way or another). She said that he deserved it. 

What brings lots of women to just find violence acceptable for stuff like cheating or even just doing something they don't like?

78,"I'll be criticing a few people here that are often championed on this forum. I'm not using any offensive language here, I'm not using attacks on character, I'm simply pointing out a few facts. If you disagree with me fine. Downvote and move on if it makes you feel better. However, try to answer my question before posting a rage comment response. If you can't answer it, it proves me correct. I am perfectly willing to admit that I am incorrect if you can answer my question.

Some people say JP. If JP is an MRA, show me one time he acknowledged a male victim of abuse (from a female offender). I can point out many times that he acknowledged female victims of abuse. However, I can't find a single time he talks about female on male abuse. Same goes for Sargon of akkad, the MRA community seems to be a fan of Sargon , but sargon is a feminist. He loves pointing out female victims of abuse from men, but I challenge you to find me a single video in which he points out a male victim of abuse. Trump is also not an MRA. Tucker Carlson is certainly not an MRA. He pushed the narrative that male abuse is OK if the attacker is female. He also said men should be expected to take care of women, but not the other way around.

This movement will go no where unless we have a speaker that addresses actual male issues (such as physical abuse and mutilation) JP is a feminist. Sargon is a feminist. Tucker Carlson is a feminist.

If I'm wrong, prove it. Show me just ONE clip in which any of these people acknowledge a male victim of abuse by a female offender. False accusations must be addressed, but physical abuse on males is also important. Seems like no one wants to address it to me.

He was bleeding from the nose and I told him to enter the club because she was coming back. I left her out and called the police..

81,"I met some women from various countries such as Denmark, Netherlands, Norway and Germany throughout this year. I'm not sure if it's because they are in another country and are therefore more sociable, or whether they are simply mis-representative of the women from their country as they are more out-going people evident by the fact that they are adventurousness enough to study abroad, or if it's simply my own projections.

But these women are so much more approachable than women I know from the Western countries like the US, Canada, Britain and Australia.

With Western women, I always feel this underlying vibe of tension. As though they're constantly suspicious, or mildly fearful of my ulterior motives, always trying to detect patterns in my body language and what I say or don't say to determine whether I'm coming on to them.

With the visiting European students I met, there's none of that. I get lost in the conversation, and it's a really pleasant experience to simply talk to them without any notion of underlying sexual motives. Like we're human beings simply communication.

I don't know how this is men's right related, but I think it is. I think part of the struggle men in Western countries face is this underlying resentment towards being perceived as sexually impulsive creatures constantly looking for victims, and that resentment is felt, at least subconsciously, in day to day social interactions.

Hiring a cleaning lady and paying to have the laundry done so she doesn't have to do it, but putting it on the credit card that she pays with his pay checks. Telling him that a crafting class she started taking a year ago lasts 4 hours and is still going on, instead she now goes out with the girls, goes to the spa and goes shopping/eating out while he watches the kids. Won thousands on a scratch ticket and never told him. Doesn't tell him that her child naps for 3 hours in the afternoon for the past few months so he can give her a ""break"" when he gets home and take the kids. Purposely drained the oil from the car so the engine would blow so he would have to buy her a new car because she didn't like the one she was driving. Told her husband that she didn't feel safe driving the older car so she could driver her husbands new luxury SUV. Bought a bunch of clothes and then waited for a thrift sale at a local church and claimed she bought them all there. Tells him she buys cheap makeup at a drug store when they really buy it at a high end place. Purposely withheld sex for 2 months because she was mad about ""going cheap"" on a kitchen remodel, and another said she did it for the entire time she was pregnant because he canceled a planned vacation when he found out she was pregnant and was concerned they couldn't afford the trip and the baby prep. Tricked her husband into a fourth baby that he didn't want by claiming her iud fell out when she really had it removed by her OBGYN. Buys gift cards for Starbucks on a gift card selling website so it doesn't show up as Starbucks because they discussed not buying coffee out to save money. Got caught having a neighborhood kid now the lawn despite claiming she had been doing it all summer, then made him feel guilty because of all the things she does the rest of the time.

97,"Hello r/MensRights

I am a High school student and currently in our Health class we are doing a unit on sexual harassment. Our class today was given a scenario and we had to determine whether or not it was sexual harassment. The scenario went something like this:

""Gina is a student who takes very good care of her body. She works out every day and today went to watch her sister's basketball practice at the school gymnasium. It was warm out, so she wore a tank top and athletic shorts. Jamie, a student who is very attracted to her, noticed Gina and approached her. He pretended to fall and rubbed up against her body. He laughed and complimented her muscles and began touching her. Gina, wanting to make sure he knew how she felt, pushed his hand away and moved away. Jamie said he was just trying to compliment her, and would not stop.""

However, half of the class got a different scenario.

""Jamie is a student who takes very good care of his body. He works out every day and today went to watch his sister's basketball practice at the school gymnasium. It was warm out, so he wore a tank top and athletic shorts. Gina, a student who is very attracted to him, noticed Jamie and approached him. She pretended to fall and rubbed up against his body. She laughed and complimented his muscles and began touching him. Jamie, wanting to make sure she knew how he felt, pushed her hand away and moved away. Gina said she was just trying to compliment him, and would not stop.""

Our class then discussed how our reactions for each scenario were very different, although the scenario was the exact same. This was an interesting exercise in itself, but while discussing the female on male assault, one of the females asked a surprising question. She asked, ""Why did he just not put a shirt on?""

But the truly shocking part about this was that the rest of the females began to agree with her. They kept repeating that it was his fault.

The hypocrisy of this angered me. These were the same people complaining about the dress code. These were the people wearing the most revealing and skimpy clothing on the planet and claiming sexism when they were sent down to the office. They keep saying how guys can't be distracted and how they can dress in whats ""Comfortable"".

I understand that it may not fit the rules of the subreddit exactly, but the guy was getting a lot of emotional support from the comments and it probably really helped him with dealing with a traumatic event like that. Seems like they could have used a bit of discretion on their sub rules considering the guy was a rape victim. I don't want to dox the guy, but here's the full text post from Ceddit:
&gt;I have never told the full story before. I have felt too ashamed and helpless during the event to tell the whole story but I guess Reddit is as good of a place as any.

&gt;In 2014, the year after I had graduated HS and moved to LA, I had come back home for Halloween to visit friends and catch up. I attended a party and saw a lot of old friends, one of whom was a friend of my Ex girlfriend.

&gt;My friend and I stood around a fire pit and talked to her, along with other people we hadn’t seen for a year or so, for a few minutes. She began speaking with my friend and it soon became obvious that he didn’t want to carry on the conversation due to his frantic look and him motioning me to help him distract her. I interjected myself into the conversation and my friend slipped away.

&gt;She was very intoxicated and very forward with me. (I had had a few beers but I wasn’t hammered) She spoke of HS and asked me questions about what the other boys thought of her in HS. I didn’t want to offend her so I told her that she was favored well and that she shouldn’t think too much about people who said otherwise. I was very vague and avoided complimenting her directly, not because I wanted to be petty but because I wasn’t interested and didn’t want to lead her on. She took it as I was complimenting her very favorably.

&gt;As the conversation continued I realized I was only digging myself into this situation even further. I made an excuse to leave and she said she would come with me. I said I needed to go to the bathroom and she said I’ll wait outside of the door. As I stand inside the bathroom wondering what to do, I couldn’t think of anything and opened the door to go back to the party hoping someone would catch her attention. But before I could do that she pulled me into a bedroom directly across from the bedroom.

&gt;Using her body weight to pull me in, I fell upon entry. She closed the door, locked it and grabbed me. She pushes me toward the bed and gets on top of me. I keep telling her that I can’t do this and that I just want to go back to the party. She continued to push herself onto me and tried to kiss me and my neck. She keeps telling me “it’s fine” and I keep saying “no” but she keeps pushing. I’m trying to be more forceful and she starts to say to me over and over the same thing. “I need this! I need this! I need this!” I’m telling her that she is too drunk and that I’m not interested and she keeps pushing. I said “I’m going to shove you off of me” and she tells me if I don’t go along with it then she will tell everyone at the party that I raped her.

&gt;I start crying and she keeps kissing me and holding me down. She says to stop yelling or she will tell everyone, so I stop and she starts to stimulate me and gets me semi-erect. She inserts me into her and holds her hand over my mouth while she is moaning. I start to soften up and she gets up and asks what’s wrong and if I didn’t fuck her well enough she would say I raped her. I couldn’t get hard and while I cried she must’ve sympathized or lost interest because she started to get dressed and said I didn’t have to worry about her telling anyone and got dressed then left the room.

&gt;I’ve never told this to anyone and I’m tired of holding it in. I realize male rape victim seems like an oxymoron but it’s not. Im ashamed of myself for it doing anything and embarrassed as a human being to allow that to happen to myself. Thanks for reading.

103,"This is a quick readout of my recent post asking those who are unhappy about your circumcision to tell me why and how. Please feel free to continue to provide feedback via comments or dm, I’m interested in anything you have to say, and reading everything that comes in. 

I’m still in the process of synthesizing your comments and extracting insight that I will share with you for feedback, but wanted to thank you and share some initial observations in the meantime.

Regarding my title, I want to be very clear that my objective for this research was NOT in any way a test to see if you would talk about your feelings, nor was it a surprise to me that you did. However, one thing reading these made me think about is the common belief that men can’t or don’t talk about their feelings. There is a flood of emotion here. It’s articulated with so much nuance, self awareness and emotional intelligence — I hope that doesn’t come across as patronizing - it’s just an observation. I mention it because it made me think about broader themes around how we (society) talk to men, particularly boys. Perhaps it would be more accurate for us to reframe this belief and examine under a lens closer to “men don’t talk about their feelings... because *no one is asking them how they feel*. This is really undeveloped and all over the place, just throwing it out there. 

Staying on topic,

There was a lot of diversity in your experiences and perspectives, but more commonality. 

I expected to see anger and resentment, and I did. I expected to see shame, and while I saw mentions of feeling/being shamed, I’m not picking up on a pattern of internalization - it appears you do not feel shame towards yourselves. Feel free to elaborate on this if you like. I was curious to see if you would report feelings of betrayal, and with a bit of translation on my part, this theme comes up a LOT. For many of you, the aspect of betrayal isn’t straightforward, these are complex and conflicting feelings. On the topic of conflicting feelings, in specific circumstances there are interesting tensions between your individual experience and your core values. More on that later.

There was also a lot of sadness, manifested and expressed in different ways I’m still parsing out. Many things you told me stand out, but the single word that I’ve been turning over in my head past few days is “despair.” I wouldn’t say this encapsulates the findings as a whole, it’s just one that really hit me personally.

What I didn’t anticipate was *anxiety*. I mentioned in one of my replies that I was aware and sensitive to the fact that I was asking people to speak candidly about a private and vulnerable topic, but seeing people not only reveal what they are feeling, but also directly and indirectly address *the way it feels to confront these feelings* — I am realizing just how big of an ask it was. While I wouldn’t describe it as an overwhelming theme across the group, there is a clear pattern of evidence that thinking and talking about this surfaces a significant level of anxiety for some. Seems like common sense now, and I can certainly relate, I just didn’t expect it and have a lot of questions about it. 

Back to the nuance point - on the subway this morning I did a quick scan of responses and pulled out mentions of emotions connected to your feelings of unhappiness. This isn’t a perfect list, I likely missed some and pulled some out of context that I’ll remove. But considering this doesn’t take into account *any* of the *many* ways emotions were described without using specific “feeling” descriptors, this list and the patterns within is actually much longer. Also keep in mind this is a small sample size, I got a handful of DMs and there were roughly 70 comments, a decent percentage of which were my own and don’t count. So it’s a lot. 

I thought you might like to see a sample representation of the “feelings men aren’t talking about”. It’s pretty sobering.

104,"I really feel for the ex\-husbands that have been saddled with insane alimony and child support for decades on end.  I've never been in that situation myself, but I'm terrified of it.  Is there any way I can help those in need?  Possibilities:

\- Educating men on the risks of marriage and cohabitation \(I'm finding my friends are very ignorant\)

\- Helping men get prenuptial agreements

\- Providing emotional and legal support to men being divorce raped by their ex\-wives

\- Creating a counter\-narrative to the ""deadbeat dad"" media game; ""malicious mom"", say

110,"Orwell was so prophetic that some political analysts have claimed (only half-jokingly) that governments are using 1984 as an instruction manual.  

As a fan of Orwell and having read most of his books and essays I was surprised to learn that he made another dystopian prediction 15 years prior to the publication of 1984.    It is contained in a letter to to his his friend Brenda Salkeld in 1933, and cited in feminist Ivett Csaszar's essay *Orwell and Women’s Issues – a Shadow over the Champion of Decency.*

&gt;In the dark vision of the future he depicted in a letter to Brenda Salkeld in 1933 Orwell considered **a “fearful tribe” of feminists to be one of the threats to civilisation.** He reflected on two directions toward which the world could move: a complete overthrow of the present order by means of a revolution or the continuing and consummate **hegemony of business accompanied by the feminists’ coming into power**: 

And here is the should-be-famous Orwell quote: 

&gt;A few years ago I thought it rather fun to reflect that our civilisation is doomed, but now it fills me above all else with boredom to think of the horrors that will be happening within ten years – either some appalling calamity, with revolution and famine, or else all-round trustification and Fordification, with the entire population reduced to docile wageslaves, our lives utterly in the hands of the bankers, and a fearful tribe of Lady Astors and Lady Rhonddas et hoc genus riding us like succubi in the name of Progress (CW 10, 317).

The author goes on note that the two ladies in question were prominent first wave feminists in Britain.  Astor was the first female Member of Parliament to take her seat, a great accomplishment to be sure, but Csaszar neglects to mention that Astor was an elitist snob, a right winger on economics, a prohibitionist, a racist, a bigot against Catholics, an anti-Semite, a supporter of male conscription and WWI, and a Nazi sympathizer (because fascism would solve the problem of the ""communists and the jews"").   As to her views on gender, I'm no expert but I suspect they were similar to other first wave feminists -- completely hypocritical.    Astor even went so far as to attack British soldiers fighting in the Italian campaign as ""D-Day Dodgers"", because the ""real"" war was in France.   Needless to say she didn't volunteer to put her own life on the line to defeat a movement she herself had supported.  

To sum up: Orwell predicted that the future would consist of corporate capitalism (""trustification"") and rule by bankers, whereby ""wage-slaves"" would be rendered docile and subject to ""Fordism"" (after Henry Ford and characterized by boring, soul-crushing, repetitive work, as on assembly lines), supplemented by rule by feminists and social progressives (""in the name of progress"").    This is, in fact, exactly what happened.   Orwell's predictions in 1933 are more accurate than anything contained in 1984.",8lw46r,antprince,1527195501,32,MensRights,0.07291982,0.034011267,0.007340072

I used to by an inpatient at a psych ward. At said psych ward there was this girl who was really into me. I liked her, but not in a physical way.


Now what happened is she'd keep trying, one time when drunk we kissed, but I immediately after made it obvious: one time thing.


Except she did not like that answer, and, instead, decided to occasionally come into my room (which can't be locked) and fondle me, I once woke up to her sitting next to me just looking at me, at one other time she was just feeling under my covers, and yet another turn she was actively masturbating me when I woke up.

125,"I lived in the middle east for many years. I noticed a problem their many of you have probably never heard of/known about... the rape of males in the middle east.

I've never seen any western media outlet talk about it, after searching with them for hours. Meanwhile female victims living their get lots of press about the rape that happens to them. (Unless if it happens in iraq or afghanistan, which the media then talks about it becomes it gives the general population living in western countries a reason to hate those countries, hence making their armies get more support for invading these countries, because of the male rape that happens their. If its a country that theirs no war against, such as jordan or the uae, they will hide the fact that male rape is common their)

Male rape is quite common their. A policeman in jordan told me he gets more calls about males being raped then females. I also got the chance to know quite a few young men in saudi arabia quite personally, and many of them sadly had a ""rape story"".

The male rape their happens to both older and younger males alike. But it mainly happened to younger boys, under the age of 10. 

And by rape, I don't mean in the western sense that they got told a sexual comment before. They actually physically get restrained and forcefully penetrated.

The reason why is mainly because people don't care about males being raped their. They can get away with it more easily then rape against females. No international organizations such as the UN care about it, their local goverments don't care about it, their families wouldn't do much about it because its their males that its done to ""and they should defend themselves""

I need to make the community here aware of the issue. Because these men in the middle east need your support. As mentioned earlier, they have no voice for themselves. Because the people in power don't care about it. So by awareness, you give their issue more attention.

I have no problem with people that struggle with something like this. Female or not. She claimed to be completely new and her dom seems to abounded her after the first and only session. That means a BDSM sex meeting for people that don't know anything about this topic. But that is ok I come to the real issue soon. She claimed to be traumatized after that. No joke she used this word. Ok I saw this and my first question was have you told the dom beforehand that your mental health is not the best. But yes it is true that some subs experience something called drop. To put it simple you have to take a lot of care after that. But that is normal and universally accepted there. I agree with this.

But this girl lied most likely about what she told him and tried to shame him online without evidence. The sad thing is that everyone was on this hate bandwagon without thinking for a second that she could be the lying one. They decided to defend simply for the fact that she was a female sub that feelings got hurt. Nothing more. I would live to show it but the whole post and the user deleted everything. That pretty much confirms how made up this whole thing was. It simply shocked me how much credibility a female has online just she claim to be a female.

I know being married to somebody for a long period of time is hard, and couples argue.  But I’m blown away at the number of men who still care and provide for, protect, and help women in anyway they can.

 Honestly, even if my neighbors have an ulterior motive, both of them are still completely respectful when they are around me. It’s unfortunate that so few women will let men be men and be appreciative of what they contribute.

One thing I know for certain, is that most men do not get much appreciation for what they do.  So thank you!",8mq7my,-blackoutusername-,1527515715,108,MensRights,0.11388343,0.04207976,0.00951496

I hear terms like misogyny and rape and harassment being thrown around half-jokingly and loosely by women. It’s like they are all super pissed at masculine behavior and traits. My hypothesis is that it’s because of Trump. Like how would African Americans felt if Barack had lost. I don’t know. I’m kind of a dominant male and it seems like women take a much more negative approach to men like me. I love them and respect them and I feel that behavior that women used to appreciate or encourage in men is now all of a sudden extremely frowned upon. It’s women are now obsessed with masculinity shaming similar to the way women will slut shame their friends for being promiscuous. I just need help parsing this and or hearing from other guys out there.I feel like if I can’t even address this topic with my male friends  without garnering gasps and negative commentary from them.

136,"This is pretty much my first political post here, I usually keep my mouth shut about politics and try to avoid any sort of political talk but felt the need to get some things off my chest as frankly I sick and tired to death of both feminism and the Alt/Extreme Right, and it seems there's no such thing as a happy medium anymore when it comes to politics. I'm sick of constantly seeing and hearing about both in the news and how people on all sides are quick to label you and put you in a box without getting the facts straight. You're either an Alt Right extremist who loves Trump or a radical feminist who despises anyone of the male gender, how did we come to this?

For the record, I'm politically an independent and have my share of disagreements with just about every political party and politician all across the board. I definitely skew pretty left politically and would say I'm overall quite liberal/progressive-minded, but overall try to maintain a moderate stance as I feel it's important to never sway too much to either side. I'd say I'm a moderately left-leaning centrist more than anything. Like just about everyone else, I've got my share of strong political views but overall keep to myself when it comes to politics. I definitely can't stand Trump and am eager for him to no longer be president, but I also must say I'm no fan of this women empowerment movement either and feel between them and Trump (as well as the Alt Right) it's like being caught in a tug of war between two terrible sides. I'm posting this here because reading through this sub I was pleasantly surprised to see it's actually pretty diverse and open-minded, and was surprised to see others of a mindset of which I thought I was the only one who existed: a (sort of) politically left person who's also opposed to feminism and finds it as toxic and damaging as Trump and extreme right politics.

I won't delve too much on why I hate Trump and the Alt Right as much as I do (bear in mind I don't hate any normal Republicans/conservatives, I feel there's an immense difference between them and the Alt Right, the latter of whom pretty much now unfortunately largely represent Republicans). I'm mainly here to get off my chest that I'm as equally fed up with feminism and the women empowerment movement as I am with the Alt Right and find it's part of the problem, not the solution. It's a different strain of the same disease that's affecting us right now and that's political extremes all across the board. 

I'm all for genuine gender equality but am so sick and tired of constantly hearing about women empowerment and women's issues when both genders deserve empowerment and attention. I'm sick and tired of seeing feminists constantly justify their blatant misandry and try to sound smart in the way white supremacists try to sound smart and justify their racism when they constantly drone on about male offenders when they willfully ignore and downplay the fact women can be offenders too, much like how white supremacists always like to vilify non-whites as criminals when they too deliberately ignore the fact whites can also be criminals. I feel both feminists and the Alt Right are equally as stupid and ignorant as each other, and both have a persecution complex. But whereas the Alt Right is rightfully condemned for their ignorance and hate, feminists constantly get a pass simply because they're women and are in a position to threaten with rape and harassment allegations they know will ruin a man's image and life forever that he can never recover from. Men are frequently blackmailed into silence to keep the peace for fear of being branded a sexist, misogynist, rapist, etc. and the woman accusing him of lying can profit off of her lies all her life and falsely be hailed as a hero when all she is a liar and manipulator. So many men and people on the left are afraid to condemn and criticize feminism for fear of this kind of backlash and the correlation is somehow made that being anti-feminist is the same as being anti-female which isn't true at all. Just like not standing for the National Anthem doesn't equate to hating America or the Armed Forces (a whole other topic I won't delve into right now but I think you get my point).

I'm so sick of seeing this and how people are quick to assume if you're even remotely leftist politically somehow you're a feminist and approve of this BS behavior. There's nothing progressive or liberal at all about feminism (at least not this horrendous modern version of it which is blatant bigotry). Likewise I also don't think all people who politically sway right are also extremists who support Trump, but unfortunately in today's climate people will assume precisely that when you say you're conservative or right-leaning. Both sides equally have their share of extremists and kooky people who get offended over stupid things and are quick to rush to judgment. I'm really disgusted and fed up with how both Trump/the Alt Right and feminists have so badly thrown the political landscape and spectrum all across the board so badly off-balance to the point extreme has become the new normal.

I know I went off on a bit of a ramble there (what can I say, my first politically charged Reddit post ever), but I'm wondering if there's other like-minded people here? Those who politically are left or sway left but are also opposed to feminism and and view it as bad as the Alt Right. I'm equally sick and tired to death of hearing about women empowerment and the patriarchy as I am of Trump's BS and hearing about fake news, etc. and am equally sick of seeing the victim mentality of both. I'm all for equality for both genders and am no in way a misogynist but knowing how whiny and triggered feminists get I'm sure some will be quick to call me just that. I'm tired of seeing men's rights and issues get ignored when both men and women deserve equal rights and opportunity, and both deserve justice when either is a victim of wrongdoing (I'm looking at you, MeToo and Time Up). I'm sick of people quick to brand you a misogynist, a Trump supporter, Alt Right, etc. whenever you say you're opposed to feminism or tired of hearing of it or that you're upset men's issues get overlooked or ignored, when chances are an anti-feminist is none of those things whatsoever and yet someone so quick to label them as such. And unfortunately just about every anti-feminist website and source I've looked at is far right which definitely also doesn't align with my views at all.

I know I ranted there a bit, haha, maybe this isn't the right sub for this but it seems there's likely to be some who feel similarly to me. I'm not trying to start anything and hope this leads to a peaceful, productive and thought-provoking conversation. I feel in today's climate with how things politically are so badly damaged and off-balance, such discussions are becoming increasingly rarer.",8mvpnc,Skeleton_Warrior,1527562464,17,MensRights,0.26859093,0.15982662,0.018019408
137,"From a Youtube comment.   

I did an interview with Saachi Khoul of Buzzfeed News yesterday. I talked about boys falling behind in education from the primary school level onward, including:

* teacher bias against boys exists (female elementary school teachers grade boys down compared to gender-blinded evaluators)

* boys are aware of this bias (when third grade boys were asked to wager money on how good a grade they expected to get on a project, they wagered less when they were told the teacher was female and would know they're a boy than when they were told the teacher was male or that the teacher wouldn't know they're a boy)

* both boys and girls agree that boys receive the bulk of negative attention from teachers in classrooms

* because school at the primary level is dominated by women, and because of the above issues, and because boys might not have their first male teacher until grade 8 math, they are likely to internalize the message that school is not for boys

Her response to that was to first ask if the boys were white. 

I was like, ""Uh... this affects all boys, including minority boys.""

She then said, ""But CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are overwhelmingly male.""

I was like... WTF? So I say, ""what does what's going on among 50 to 70 year olds in the top 1 tenth of 1% of the population have to do with how boys are doing in elementary school?""

She says, ""well, men are still dominant.""

I said, ""those male CEOs were boys in elementary school 40 to 60 years ago. What does that have to do with what's happening now in elementary schools? You have to realize there's a bit of a lag at work here, and if you look at age cohorts from oldest to youngest, you find women and girls catching up and then surpassing men and boys as you track backwards from older to younger cohorts. Single women in their 20s in cities now earn 8% more than their male counterparts. Your entire argument here seems vindictive--like you're happy to see boys punished because men are still dominant in the top 1% at age 50.""

""So MRAs are complaining about women catching up, is what you're saying.""

I said, ""women had parity in post secondary enrolment in the 1980s.""

She comes back with me not being intersectional enough. ""Yes, but women of color earn much less compared to white men.""

I said, ""Not to get all intersectional on you, but the gender gap favoring women in post-secondary attainment in the US is largest in the black community.""

The producer interrupts and tries to get us back on the topic of bias against primary school boys and asks her to clarify her counterargument. She replies that she thinks her point about the dominance of men at the top of Fortune 500 companies is an adequate rebuttal. (WTF!!!????)

157,"So you're an employer, and half of the population has a chance to have to abandon work to bring new life into the world and also will thereafter be responsible for caring for that new life, in such a devoted way that they can't really do quite as much for your business anymore. You know this is a possibility for that portion of people you employ. They therefore are most likely given opportunity to take parental leave, meaning you must ensure they can return to work when ready, with the same pay and similar work, while you have to find a person or people to fill in that labor gap during said leave. Then you have to figure out what to do with that other, new employee. More than likely you may have had to pay them while they provided little to nothing to your micro-managed business that has been your primary focus for some time, and you yourself are probably making your reproductive plans to make the least effect on your business. The other person can make you no such guarantee and really to expect that would be insane. On top of that if you provide a subsidized or free health insurance plan to that employee, you're paying for their hospital bills from when they had to produce a new life form from their own body.

There is another half of the population that, while they can still be parents, are not allotted a parental leave of any kind. In fact, in the event they become a parent they may even push for bigger, more important positions in the workplace and while they may expect raises and try for positions that make you rely on them more, they will not have an option given by law to allow them to go home and raise their children while still receiving pay or expecting to return to their job where they left off.

162,"Hello all. I'm looking for a man's point of view on circumcision. My husband and I recently discovered that we've got a little one on the way!
Personally, I am against circumcision without consent and if it's a boy, I do not want to have it done to him as an infant. My reasons are risk of infection, botched circumcisions, and development of nerve endings in the head of the penis. Also, I remember when my parents had my little brother circumcised, the doctor used a ring that caused the tissue to fall off after a week or so and it was supposed to also fall off, but it didn't and 9 year old me had to help my mom remove this ring from my infant brother's swollen penis. Itwas very sad to me because he was screaming bloody murder for the 30 minute home operation, his penis was very inflamed and raw, and we had to cut the ring off with nail clippers. If my child asks for it later on in life, that is different but ultimately I want it to be his choice and I couldn't see myself allowing my child to experience what my brother did, among others.
My husband is circumcised and has expressed that he would want to have our son circumcised too, and when I brought up my concerns he dropped his point of view, but rather quickly. I didn't feel like it was because he actually agreed, but more because he just didn't want it to be a point of conflict. When I asked him about it again, he just said that it isn't important enough to him to go around about it and if I really don't want to do it, then we won't. 
For the record, we are not religious. I think his reasons for being for it are just general tradition and looks, but I'm not sure. I don't know if I'm just being paranoid, but I also don't want my husband to feel like I would just bulldoze over his feelings about it since he's the one who actually does have a penis. 

TL;DR: I basically just want to get some points of view from men about how they feel about circumcision from both sides of the issue. ",8o66gs,Crabtoe,1527999532,33,MensRights,0.2853768,0.036325075,0.012026439

Me not moving cat after she wanted to move him into the bedroom…. Me not making room after months of her saying she was going to make room for him in the bedroom

Me both listening and not listening to her ever

I have to not get excited to see her after she goes out to a friend’s all week and says she will be home to do some things with me and to make dinner then not upset when she is hours if not days late with out telling me. Because it’s rude to use her phone in front of her best friend even to tell me plans have changed. I can not get disappointed after she disappears 

Me not saying please every 100000 and 1 times a day to her son to get his thump out of his mouth (even if he is only home for 2 hours so far) the first 20 please and thank you don’t count. I can't get find it tedious to tell him 

Not being physical able to do cat litter it’s my fault the apartment smells of cats


It’s my fault for not wanting to give up my favorite kitten (my emotional support kitten) to someone because the other 2 kittens bug their mother 

It’s my fault for not being able to handle her need to yell all the time… even though she says she hates yelling 

Not being physically able to be the only 1 cleaning Yet she doesn’t leave her bed for days or weeks at a time. She tells me the mess her and her kids make aggravates her and I have to keep up her ocd standards of clean


I can’t believe in men’s rights issues. I can’t believe in a man being innocent. I have to see a hit piece on a man as fact and him as an abuser enen after seeing proof of it being innocent. Even though she gets to bad mouth the men before and after court then gets to tell me she believes in waiting and letting the legal system work

Mad at me for not being myself … Mad at me for being myself. Mad at me for being depressed. Mad at me for getting better 


Telling me she felt raped……telling me it wasn’t my fault. Telling me she should of said no. Telling me she just wanted to go with it. Telling me not to beat myself up…. Yelling that I raped her at the top of her lungs every time we fight…. Yelling at me for beating myself up... Telling me 4 months after we last had sex

Finding away to stop the cats from getting under her bed(futon) but not when it’s a couch was wrong/stupid /a waste of time. When it’s a bed for all but 6 hours in 6 months

Not getting her the medication she needed even though I tried for weeks and was told not to worry about getting it plus she didn’t want to take it. Even though she could of gone to get it herself. I'm physically disappointed yet still kept going to the drug store for her. 

Asking her what she might want to eat for the week got me bitched out because she didn’t feel like eating at that moment

Apparently saying could you do ____ &amp; can you help me with _____, is using abusive and miniataive language. And saying OK when she says no is not ok

173,"I provided this answer when asked what MRAs stands for. Please give me feedback.

“Actually egalitarianists and MRAs are perceived that way because there is a powerful narrative that associates women=feminists and MRAs as anti women. It’s true that MRAs are concerned with feminism, and believe it or not for very good reasons (which we could talk about later if you want), but not with women in general, or no more with women than men, meaning that the individual should be judged based on her/his actions not on irrelevant superficial characteristics that postmodernism claim define that individual and puts she/he in a group (black, male, homosexual, etc...). The point is that any narrative that portrays the interaction between groups as one of eternal conflict and at the same time it puts one group as solely a perpetrator and other solely as victim, is going to produce cases of abuse, specially if it is asked to deny the presumption of innocence based on your gender (giving presumption of truth to the accuser is denying the presumption of innocence of the accused) 

Women are as perfect, ethical, and infalible as men, meaning not so much. We don’t believe that the main explanation of human behavior is social constructivism (and feminism has a long history of denying biological truths regarding differences in tastes and interests). But here is the most important idea:

The differences between individuals inside any group defined by social constructivism (gender, race, sexuality, etc...) is always much much bigger than any difference of averages of behaviors between different groups. This is statistics, not an opinion.

What this means is that it would be absurd to judge an individual based on which of these so called groups this individual belongs. Also it would be absurd to destroy individuality and define an individual’s opinion, ideas or culture based on which group postmodernism assigns to this individual, specially so as this false narrative define groups as perpetually in conflict and defines them based on what should be considered superficial and irrelevant characteristics. 

Feminism believes in the differences between groups outcomes (as statistics show) and assigns these differences solely to social constructivism. We acknowledge that although social constructivism exist, to deny biological facts and focusing in equality of outcome instead of equality of opportunities and rights leads to generating an inequality of rights and opportunities. I would have to mention that also shows an incoherence within feminism, as feminism portrays males in a very bad light (always the agresor, never the victim, “toxic masculinity”, patriarchy (in-group bias between men) etc...) while at the same time explaining any and all difference in outcome due to social constructivism.

Now, I am not saying that feminism is the devil incarnated, I was a feminist and it’s clear to me that its objectives, if defined by the narrative and not the acts, are perfectly benign. The main problem that I see is that it base the solutions based on a reductionist perspective of history that defines oppressor-victim dynamics based on the very same characteristics that pretends to defend, quite rightly, as irrelevant and superficial, like gender, race, sexuality, etc... instead of acknowledging that the main explanatory variable in those oppressor-victim dynamics has been power. To not change the dynamic, and just changing the outcome of that dynamic by swapping it upside-down don’t change the injustices that would eventually arise, some of them, although in a different scale, can be seen nowadays in occidental culture. Instead of basing our present behavior on a bad interpretation of history we should base our present behavior on what we want society to eventually become, and therefore concepts like culture appropriation, privilege, etc... don’t help, only perpetuates the same dynamic with only changes in a hierarchy, a hierarchy based on group identity which we should destroy, instead of just simply modify. Instead of seeing groups as perpetually in conflict we should move away from that perspective, which becomes a self fulfilling prophecy, and try to merge all “group cultures”, making a culture in which any individual feel safe and free.

MRAs believe that Feminism is a movement that lacks self criticism, lacks moderation, not intentionally but still. Concepts like safe spaces and trigger warnings generates eco chambers, individuals just interact with other individuals with the same ideas, this generates the axioms of the ideology to be integrated within the core ideas that shape personality which creates radicalism that goes unnoticed as there isn’t any challenge to the narrative and, more importantly, any difference in opinion is perceived as a challenge and an offense and, as the individual culture and personality is defined by the group, any difference in opinion can be understood as hate speech, rather than a difference in opinion. We usually face the accusation of some -ism when offering different perspectives or challenging feminist narrative.

Probably due to these factors explained just now, MRAs have been wrongly associated, twice, with violent shooters and white supremacism. Again, false accusations all of them. We have sustained a very long discrediting campaign now in which we are associated with intolerance and misogyny and homophobia and racism. As an homosexual male living in Africa I can tell you this isn’t true. It’s true though that in the past year we are seeing more oddballs and unsavory individuals coming to Mensrights thinking that they are going to find here people that support their bias and prejudices. I am not going to declare that these people aren’t “real” MRAs, that would be a logical fallacy called “no true Scotsman”.  What I think is worth nothing is that I see that the movement is constantly trying to moderate the new members, which come here believing the narrative that, IMO, feminism is offering regarding us. Their accusations may one day become a successful self fulfilling prophecy, but we are far away from that and, usually, the radicals realize this isn’t their group and move to others. Still we face a torrent of negatives when we declare ourselves equalitarianists or MRAs.

Just a couple month ago I saw an extremely unusual post in Mensrights, it said something among the lines of kill all feminists or something like that. I had never seen such a thing in Mensrights. I answered to this post an explained all the different things that were wrong with it. I received a private message from the author and discovered that this was a kid, barely in his adolescence that claimed that it was all a test to see if we thought that way. Later he retracted and apologized to everyone there. I think it was a test all right, but probably was also a test for himself or a cry for help because this kid, and this is just speculation, seemed to me to look for some role models, he seemed to be drifting without direction and arriving to very dark places within himself and looked for some validation. Why did he came to Mensrights to say such a thing? While acknowledging that we are receiving people that challenge our origins and core ideas and that in order to be counted as a MRA only thing necessary is to claim to be one, I can’t help but see the double standards, as there have been examples of self proclaimed feminists asking for reducing male population to 10% of the total population or to simply kill all men. I think that portraying feminism by its most extremists and radicals isn’t fair. I hope you can also see that defining MRAs by the worst of what a minority of us do, would also be unfair.

Regarding what we stand for, we want to rise awareness about the massive discrimination of males in occidental democratic societies regarding Justice/law, health, education, safety/security and working conditions. Once awareness is created we want a society based in equality of rights and opportunities and the end of identity politics. 

I do agree that MRA is as bad a term as feminism. I believe we should all move away from identity politics and call ourselves egalitarians. Regardless you will find transexuals, homosexuals, women and all races between MRAs, we just don’t define ourselves by what we consider irrelevant superficial characteristics in regards rights and opportunities. While intersectional feminism want to create equality of outcome based on a model that compensate the past and understands humanity as a collection of groups in perpetual conflict we want to create a present that represents how we want society to be in the future, one in which individuals aren’t defined by the idea of group, but by their own individuality, their own ideas, opinions and behaviors, with the same rights and opportunities, in which every individual can feel safe and free. 

Although not related directly with MRAs or egalitarianism, I also believe in those words that said, “I am human, nothing human is alien to me” (Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto). All cultures belongs to each and every human. All history is a single history and belongs to each and every one of us.”",8oc0jl,ignigenaquintus,1528062676,3,MensRights,0.15600902,0.04969218,0.00780612

181,"My question is only about the term, not the practice. I am 110% in support of the right to genital integrity for all people, starting from when they draw their first breath. I'm completely against routine male infant circumcision, and would be delighted to see the surgery banned until the ages of 16-18, when the patient is able to consent and understands the benefits and risks. Anytime a circumcision is performed on a child should strictly be in a medical emergency situation. However I do kinda take issue with the term MGM. The reason for that being is that sometimes, circumcision is legitimately carried out on a man for medical reasons with his consent, and I think we're all in agreement that that is perfectly okay. The man had his foreskin removed entirely at his discretion. His genitals shouldn't be considered mutilated though, right? A kid might need a circumcision after a pretty bad infection, or due to bad damage done to his foreskin after an accident like, caught in a zipper or something. Or the many men on this planet who did get circumcised as babies but still have functional genitalia they enjoy (again, not saying that circumcision as babies is okay), isn't it wrong to consider those guys as genitally mutilated? I'm mostly worried that the term MGM will only cause body issues in men who are circumcised, making those guys feel inadequate or ashamed of their bodies. Fuck knows we don't want to damage the self-esteem of men. Plus naturally, this can cause men to last out and become defensive of their manhood, and ergo, the practise of infant circumcision, which isn't going to help the cause. 

So in summary: I think that the term MGM causes feelings of shame and body issues, and can make people become defencive, which is counter-productive. 

What do you guys and gals think? Perhaps I'm mistaken? I'm very open to other interpretations and having my opinion changed. Cheers!  ",8oqe61,AngryBreadRevolution,1528201690,2,MensRights,0.15766735,0.025413504,0.009981008

187,"One of the common questions you will hear asked in feminism circles on the issue of sexual assault and false accusations is that of why men are so concerned about them. After all, in their minds, we have a rapist as the President of the United States, so obviously accusations made against average men—as in, non-billionaires—mean nothing, right?

I have, over time, created a few of the reasons why your average man would be afraid of a false accusation. Here are a few. If you have any additional ideas, please provide them, but try to avoid overlap.

[1] Standards for evidence are practically non-existent in universities.

The Obama era laws about determining the merit of a sexual assault accusation give universities the right to suspend or expel students for merely being accused.

[2] Standards for what qualifies as sexual harassment and sexual assault are gradually becoming more extreme.

30% of young American women believe that a male co-worker asking them to go out for drinks qualifies as sexual harassment.

Aziz Ansari's #MeToo literary revenge porn ruined his career. And he was a vocal supporter of feminism, even in its extreme forms.

[3] Feminists believe that collateral damage is fine, as long as conviction rates go up.

[4] Feminists adamantly reject the notion that false accusations occur.

The highest cited figure I've ever seen a feminist make was 2%, which was the extreme lowest point in the data, taken from a source that said “between 2% and 8%.” To a feminist, if you're accused of a sex crime as a man, even without evidence, they believe you are automatically in the wrong and can ruin your life over it.

[5] False accusations are something which men exclusively have to worry about.

Women almost never get accused of sexually predatory behavior, and even when they do, they hardly ever see punishment for it. Even when they're found indisputably guilty of sexually assaulting a man, they are almost never convicted. They have the luxury of knowing that they will be fine.

[6] Psychopaths exist. Some of them are women.

A female psychopath will be listened to and believed over a man. Even if she has been found to have made a false accusation against a man before, she can put a rich man in prison for years (see the Mike Tyson case).

[7] There is almost never any punishment for making a false accusation.

A woman has nothing to lose by falsely accusing a man of a sex crime. Feminists have argued zealously against false accusers behind held legally accountable.",8oxdnp,Bigfartyshit,1528255875,138,MensRights,0.39644176,0.37619758,0.02492592

191,"Tl;dr: I suspect that there's evidence that the chilling effect created by laws against workplace harassment disproportionately affects minorities. If you know of any studies or even anecdotes that might support this, I'd be very interested to see them!

——————————————

I've found an incredibly useful tool against feminist ""rape culture"" hysteria is to point to evidence that it disproportionately affects men. (And there is plenty out there, but that's not the point of this post.) The same goes for a lot of causes that liberals/progressives, and especially feminists, champion. (I sometimes liken proposed law and policy reforms designed to ""protect women"" to the Clinton crime bill from the '90s that is now uncontroversially called racist even by liberals.)

I know that there's at least anecdotal evidence that white women are disproportionately likely to falsely/frivolously accuse minority men of rape or sexual assault—or as we say now, ""misconduct"", since that could mean anything, even if it doesn't fit any formal definition of assault or even harassment—and history tells us that the groups hurt most by weakened due process and low burdens of proof are minorities and lower-income people.

I, and I'm sure most of you, would confidently wager that if this matter were studied quantitatively, or if it has been, it would confirm this pattern. Lately I've been curious whether there *are* such studies and I'm especially interested, because of recent conversations I've been having, with such studies pertaining to workplace harassment claims filed by women against men.

See, I already believe that parts of some laws such as Title VII (and IX for that matter) and ways in which the OCR investigates and enforces them unquestionably lead a chilling effect on free speech created unconstitutionally by the state—though that's a very difficult proposition to defend for whatever reason. It's basically a tad outside the Overton window and the only response you'll get is, ""You aren't seriously arguing that sexual harassment isn't 'bad, mmmkay?'""

But where appeals to notions of ""freedoms"" invented by ""dead white males"" fail, I think that appeals to civil rights could be effectively used to demolish self-righteous feminists' moral high ground here.

***The idea is to show the reductio ad absurdum of civil rights laws that enable one group which they seek to protect (women) to discriminate against and persecute another such group (minorities) against which they harbor prejudice.*** The common-sense (and qualitatively provable) assumption that women can be guilty of racial prejudice/animus should be enough to make this reductio pretty obvious or at least plausible. But if we had something even more solid and ""scientific"" then feminists could be forced to confront the racist (and for that matter classist) implications of some of their most cherished causes.",8p8j5n,RobDog101,1528358602,2,MensRights,0.28548008,0.13245803,0.013631714

I volunteered to be a 'chaperone' on my 5 year old son's school trip (field trip) to a local attraction. There were myself, an older guy who was relative of a teacher, another dad whose sole responsibility was to care for his son who is autistic, and there were then 4 of the mothers chaperoning. All of whom were nice, no issues. 

My son loves his teacher, who again is really nice and a great teacher. 

We went around the attraction and we needed to let the kids go to the toilet before we moved on to the next thing. Two of the mums moved down the stairs towards the toilets and I thought I'd go down to volunteer to help the boys (they can all go to the toilet themselves and it was more to safeguard as they are public toilets).

I was promptly told that ""due to the risk assessment"" that male volunteers were not allowed to assist with taking any of the children to the toilets. 


I had to pretend I was alright with it (it's not the time or place to have a debate!) but I was appalled at the glaring sexism and presumption that all males are potential paedophiles and sexual predators.

When gaining employment women should automatically be hired over men based on gender alone, not education, experience, or skills. On top of this physical requirements for the job should be lowered if they are too hard for women to do, or can't do them at all.

Baby P is a perfect example of why fathers should be at least considered for custody.  Or they should at least be granted occasional custody.   

Baby P, whose name was Peter, was essentially tortured from the time he was born.   His mother hooked up with a ""six foot tall guy!"" who also happened to be a brutal sadist.   The sadist spent the next several years torturing the baby, pealing off his fingernails and toenails, hurting/smacking the baby whenever he saw him, and actually training their dog to bite the boy.  And all the while, his mother did jack shit.   

Eventually the brute broke the boy's back (the man cracked him over his knee).  The child wouldn't stop crying, so eventually the man punched the child in his face over and over again until he died.

Within 2 days she sent me a picture of a positive pregnancy test.  She came over and I watched her take about 10 more, nearly all of them were positive - the digital ones not the bullshit line ones - clear blue expensive type.

Long and short she must have miscarried because we did a lot of testing and eventually the dr said she was pregnant but wasn’t any longer...I don’t need to go into details.

Nonetheless it brought us back together because I wanted to be supportive and it was about 3-4 weeks before we knew the truth.

So now I’m away and I’ve been thinking about breaking it off again - have not said anything though and she sends me another positive stick this AM.  

She’s supposedly on the pill, except that 1 week apparently when she switched pharmacies or something I don’t have a clue.

So, in summary she has been on the pill for about 10 months and has now gotten pregnant twice in the span of 5 months.

I was just casually scrolling through my news feed and an article from the Washington post caught my attention: ""WHY CAN'T WE HATE MEN?"" I had not read it at thar point but I was already shocked but I gave it a try anyway. It's a good thing to look at an issue from different perspectives anyway. This writer demands a massive wave of apology from men and the giant hero image of the article is Harvey Weinstein.

From what I get from her views, all men own her an apology for the masculinity in their DNA and she presumes all men are like Harvey Weinstein. This mindset is not just sickening, it's also dangerous. It is a terrible choice to hate 50% of the population. For a matter of fact, a majority of men are not bad people. Yes, while there are people like Harvey Weinstein, who abuse their power but the majority of men just want to reach their full potential, have a career, and maybe eventually get married. By demanding an apology from all men, she alienate men as some kind of a different species.

There are a huge number of other things that I witness in everyday life, too. How awkward the interaction between men and women have become. How it is now seen as evil of you don't like a certain types of girl. The list goes on. And when I read through all these words portraiting masculinity as evil, I really can't understand how someome can cope with this kind of bullshit and function properly when all they hear now is their own DNA is somehow evil and just be existing, they own someone an apology. I can't even with the wage gap bs.

I am deeply sorry that it has come so far and i can tell, these accusations have damaged many people who just have good intentions and given some sort of identity crisis. I believe that we are all for equality, but feminism is taking many steps too far and they are given too much coverage and voice.

If you are a good man with good intentions, you have nothing to worry about and you own no one an apology. Especially in Western culture, no authority tells a woman that she can't go to college or vote or get a job. If her life is miserable and bitter and sad, it's not your fault. How can it be?

So of course now she is claiming that perhaps she was a victim of Bill Clinton because he was so powerful. 

Here is my main problem with this whole thing. She claimed in an interview with Barbara Walters that she let Bill Clinton know she had a crush on him, I am sorry but as an adult, if a woman had ever said to me ""I have a crush on you"", it means ONE THING and ONE THING ONLY and that is ""I want to have sex with you"", for me it is the equivalent of asking someone back to your place for ""COFFEE"". That is the language that is used, that is simple, in fact, some (me included) would call what she did giving verbal clues to her consent.

Sure, #Metoo can give her great power now to claim her victimhood and claim he was so powerful that there weren't any circumstances in which she could consent.

Facts:
- I am currently going through a custody battle.
- We are meeting with the custody evaluator this week.
- We separated in September 2017.
- I currently have our kids every other weekend.
- We have joint physical and legal custody -&gt; our judge has written that we are required to share in major responsibilities like daycare.


Issue:
- My ex has signed up our youngest (of 3) into a new (separate) daycare/preschool.

Problems:
- This would be the 5th or 6th daycare that my ex has put the kids into since the separation.
- This new daycare is more than twice the cost of the old daycare but is much closer.
- My ex has continued to refuse to return our children to our church daycare/preschool -&gt; she can't make the 15 minute drive for her 8  hour workday during their 10 hours of daycare.


Current thoughts:
- My thought is to talk with the daycare director and explain that I simply can't afford the daycare and show how many prior daycares my ex has put our kids into the last few months.
- My attorney notes to don't do anything. My attorney says this could be harassment and could impact our custody battle.
- My therapist notes to follow the advice of my attorney.
- My budget notes that I'll need to pick up another job to pay for not seeing my kids. 
- Our family court judge stated in her temporary motion conclusion that we should share in life decisions for our kids like daycare.

215,"When you put an imaginary line on the 9 month time scale between conception and birth, and claim that on one side of that line, the fetus is not human, and on the other side, it is, there are logical consequences that should not be avoided..

The first consequence is that a man cannot create a child. He can only help create a fetus.

The second consequence is that only the woman can create the child by carrying the fetus over that imaginary time point.   

If its the woman's sole decision to create the life, then it's the woman's sole responsibility. If the man decided that he did not want to be a father, it would not prevent the woman from carrying the child to birth, but he should not be held responsible, financially or otherwise, for the woman's decision. 

I think for many pro-legal surrender MRAs, we can agree up to this point.

However, there is a flipside to this. If it is the woman's sole responsibility, then man should only be afforded custody rights, if those rights are offered to him by the mother. In other words, the man is not automatically given custody rights. Those rights and responsibilities can only be offered by the mother. If she doesn't offer, if she doesn't want him in her or the child's life, then she should have the right not to let him in, but she doesn't get a cent in child support.

I'm in agreement with the flip side to legal parental surrender. I don't think a man should be given custody rights, nor should be be held responsible for a child simply because it possess half his genes. The logical consequence of defining the beginning of human life as an even occurring during pregnancy, is that man cannot create a child.

For those MRAs who are pro-choice for women, pro-legal surrender for men, but, feel that the man should be given automatic custody rights, how do you argue your position?",8q0oxq,sampatri,1528636241,4,MensRights,0.09438288,0.027347196,0.008764107

So I go to a private school that’s pretty cool with who it caters too (I’m not going to name the school for privacy reasons. The school caters to those with learning differences that need other forms of education. 

I just finished my freshman year of high school (1-12) so I’m kind of used to it, but the first thing I noticed during my shadow day in fourth grade was that there were not a lot of girls (maybe 2-4 out of the class of 12-13 that I shadowed).

222,"It would require a huge anthropological-historical study to answer that question. First of all, feminist interpretations (and sexist male ones) would have to be removed as much as possible, and the whole of history re-assessed.

The answer is not as simple as seeing who the king was at a particular time. Society is complex, and to imagine that the kings were not influenced by the women they slept with every night is preposterous. Then there's the whole area of child rearing - women control most of a child's early experiences and heavily influence the learning of language.

Sure, if you look at the official, formal structures of power it might look like men are in charge. But most of society happens outside the palace or the parliament, and it's here that women have shown their influence.

And finally, almost all men want sex with women, and to settle down with one. That is one of the most important goals in an average man's life, and only women can grant this boon. That's a huge amount of power in itself.

Feminism itself demonstrates the power of women. They have demanded things from men, and men in power have given them, albeit sometimes with a delay. If men demand things of men in power, there's usually bloodshed before they get what they want, if ever.

It's well beyond time for a radical new assessment of society and history, and that is unlikely to come from feminist-dominated universities. Fortunately, we have the Internet with which we can begin to deconstruct the false history created by feminism.

224,"I keep seeing arguments about male-female violence and they always end up in ""never hit women because they are weaker"", and no one else knows what else to say so they agree no matter the context, or who is the victim and who is the violent one.
So i wanted to share my two cents on the issue: If the only argument against men hitting women (in defense or in situations when it's called for, as violence in general is never ok) then why doesn't this rule apply when a weak man hits a strong man?
If a weak man hits a strong man no one will expect the string man to sit and take it, and tell him ""don't you even dare to hit him, he is weaker"". But instead they will be glad justice was served and the violent person was put in his place. 

So...why is it any different with women?

A woman hitting a man makes her violent, aggressive, and a man being hit by someone is demeaning for him no matter how many layers of muscles his arms has. Pain especially emotional pain, and shame, and everything else a woman feels when she is hit by a man is the same for a man who is hit by a string man, a weak man, or a woman. Pain doesn't disappear because your biceps are bigger.

So since violence is violence and pain is pain, no matter the gender, why treat it differently?

227,"This is something that I've been thinking about for a while. I know the stereotype of feminists is that they're just a bunch of fat, ugly lesbians because they're jealous of the attention beautiful women receive and that nobody wants to date them. Based on the ones I've encountered, I don't consider that to be the truth. It's a complicated question, much more than I realized at first glance when I wanted to know the answer. 

First of all, I don't think all feminists are the same. I've listened to the ones who argue that feminism is the answer to the problems men face. Some of them are even genuine about it, even if their worldview is deeply flawed. 

I'd divide them into two main groups. The first group of feminists are feminists because that's what they've been taught in their lives. They've never had much reason to question it. If you're taught in school and in the media and in your normal routine that women are oppressed and men are privileged, it's pretty easy to believe. To give you some idea of the garbage I was taught in school, one of my textbooks claimed: ""One in 4 college men will commit rape"". There was quite a bit of additional bullshit, but I think people who read this can surmise the rest. 

Dealing with things like men flirting with you when you go out, whether at a bus stop, restaurant, or place of employment when you're not interested is only likely to solidify it. Being the victim of actual harassment is even worse, particularly if from your perspective, others are not sympathetic to your plight. These are the kind of feminists that argue that in order to help men, we need to teach them to be more like girls. Masculinity is a poison that we need to remove, teaching them to be more sensitive and open with emotions. I cannot 100 percent confirm this, but I get the impression that prior to making The Red Pill, Cassie Jaye was this type of feminist. 

The second group is a lot uglier. These are the ones who truly do hate men, the people who believe that men, as a whole, are brutal, violent thugs, that beat and rape women and consider this perfectly acceptable behavior. These are the feminists like Jessica Valenti, Robin Morgan, Valerie Solanas, Susan Brownmiller, Andrea Dworkin, Marilyn French, and many others. These are women who clearly do despise men, who think men have no issues, that they deserve whatever horrible thing happens to them. Men are responsible for all the problems in the world, your typical men are people like Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein. I could go on and on, but the point stands. 

This is the group that generally believes in rape culture, that men consider it normal and acceptable to rape women. Not to say I haven't heard this attitude expressed among the first group, but it's a lot more common among the second. 

I've always wondered: how did they develop such deep\-seated hatred towards men? Certainly, there are those who hate men in spite of not having anything happen to them, but I think it's deeper than that. Loathing an entire gender... there usually is a reason for it, sadly. 

Being a victim of rape? That's certainly possible. It's likely to poison your view of men in the short term from the initial trauma, especially if you open up to others and they prove to be unsympathetic. While I've seen no evidence that this sort of attitude is normal (If it is, how come I've never heard any man express such a thing), that sort of belief does exist. Moreover, I've listened to female MRAs who have been raped and are still fighting for men's rights. They haven't allowed one monster to taint their view of men as a whole. 

I've read some of their posts on here and in magazines. For the second type of feminist... I'd say a lot of it comes from having a bad relationship with their father. I know it's easy to sneer and laugh that all feminists have daddy issues, but the more I looked at it, the more sense it made. The relationship with our parents do a great deal to define who we are, from our political beliefs to how successful we are in life. Our father is the first and biggest male role model we end up with. The people I've talked to, people I've read online... the repeating theme in the hostile attitude towards men and their problems is having a bad relationship. Some of them were abandoned by their fathers, ignored by their fathers, or abused by them. Either way, there's a lot of anger towards their father and that bleeds into their attitude towards men for their entire lives.

It's a sad fact that if someone is abused by their parents, they're a lot more likely to end up in abusive relationships as adults. Particularly for women, if they had an abusive father, or their mother's boyfriend abused them... and then they end up in an abusive relationship with a men, that's going to have a serious effect in how they perceive men. 

For certain people, their attitudes on the gender war are decided as young children and don't change very much after that.  

This belief doesn't necessarily have to come from a woman either; men in that situation, assuming they break out of the pattern and don't fall into it themselves, can hold a very low opinion of other men. One example of this is the United States' previous president, Barack Obama. If you look at his childhood, his father abandoned them before he was even born. He grew up idealizing him, but when he was in college, he finally learned the ugly truth. Barack Obama Sr. was an abusive alcoholic who brutalized his wives, brutalized his children, killed someone in a drunk driving accident, and was a pathological liar. 

This is a very simple explanation, of course. You could probably divide them into several different groups and of course, the two groups have considerable overlap. However, these are just my thoughts on what drives men and women to these beliefs. ",8qkc9r,Philip8000,1528820884,14,MensRights,0.44933176,0.44126466,0.013528148

229,"First I will say this is not my real account, for obvious reasons. I have thought about this topic a lot, and have some unique insights. I will try to keep this pertaining to specifically to the realm of men's rights however.

I would though be happy to discuss the other issue of pedophila to the best of my ability. 

All that said I hope you can read this with a critical eye, and concider my point. 

To start I will explane what prompted me to write you. I was listening to the recent broadcast  of Honey Bader Radio and was troubled to hear that Alison (Snake voice) ""The boss"" used pedophile interchangeably  with child molester. 

This is a problem for a few reasons. Men already have pedophile used as a weapon against them, from male sexuality (liking ""young women""), to other sexual preferences like perky breasts.

Men are uniquely targeted for having unhealthy interests in children. Even though women are pedophiles as well. 

I would guess the precentage of women that are pedophiles is the same as men but there is a huge grey number regarding both female pedophiles, and pedophiles in general. This is a digression but an important one as it has larger implications.

This next section is a small portion of my reasoning regarded why I think this will help both children and those who suffer with pedophilia. Specifically men who suffer.

The biggest issue is that this configuration between pedophile and child abuse, is pedophilia is a mental illness. Treating pedophila as already hurting children makes anyone who is dealing with pedophila less willing to get help. Men already do not seek mental health help to begin with, how can anyone expect them to open up about it when they will just be considered a monster even for just thinking.

That hurts both men and children. There are not really any good treatments. We have only the worst sample to draw from. We get them from people who already offend, and have many reasons to lie about factors. 

Imagine there are three groups within the over arching group of pedophile. The first is the ""ideal"", they recognize the harm of acting, are in control of their desires and have found ethical ways to deal with them. This group would be able to more openly help others. This is also why we have grey numbers. We don't know how many are in this or the second category and never offend.

The second are the more ""real"", they have this attraction, understand it is harmful to act but have no coping methods or support, this is the group that can go either way. Helping them protects children and them, as many will commit suicide before offending.  

The third group are the ""worst"" they are also sociopaths who don't care or can't see the harm, this group won't be affected either way. Nor do we know how many get caught.

Treating pedophila as a mental illness that in itself is not the same as child abuse is a step we can take, without the liability of being called pedophile apologists, to help keep children safe and help men. Again none of this is apologia. Pedophila is recognized as a ligament mental illness. Child abuse is a horrific crime they have over lap but are not the same. We should recognize that distinction. We have seen how conflating men with rape has been used.

It becomes much harder to attack men with this as if it is a mental illness the attacker becomes a ""shitty person"". It also requires them to either give a libelous or scandalous insult. I think any fallacy tool we can take away from a detractor is a good goal, both for men's rights and discourse in general.",8qkn23,Ok_Interest,1528823046,0,MensRights,0.15213956,0.035774168,0.013269233

239,"There was interesting post on TIL today about an African Gynaecologist who does great work on the victims of FGM and how he requires protection to get his work done. Now everyone is rightly in favour of this and we need more doctors like him. 

The subject of MGM was brought up in passing given it's prevalence in the region and of course immediately the deniers were out in force about how MGM isn't like FGM and how it is beneficial against AIDs etc. I questioned how we would feel about FGM if it was beneficial against AIDs and every single comment was in denial about FGM and MGM being anywhere near comparable and that the analogy was false. 

What I don't understand is what is the benefit to anyone of pushing a view that MGM is somehow lesser than FGM from a straight ethical perspective. The most common FGM appears to be slightly worse than the most common MGM but they certainly are comparable enough that go yeah let's think again before you know mutilating children. How did this view develop? On such a simple ethical quandary ""To mutilate children or not"" can people have such tinted glasses and refuse to see boys as a far as I can tell as equals to little girls. 

Reddit is often accused of misogyny etc but there seems to be just as much denialism and bigotry towards the concerns of boys and men (especially in specific areas) alongside alleged sexism towards women.

240," I will write a completely blunt text that is going to make a lot of people angry. I am female and most assuredly in SJWs minds, a gender traitor. 

For me feminism is **NONSENSE.**Every last bit of it is utter rubbish and I am sick to death hearing about it. I am not at all a feminist, because suddenly feminism means that as much as they would like to say equality, what they really mean is *better, elevated, and superior.* There is no responsibility for action any longer, of feelings for that matter. You can “feel” however you want to feel, just keep it to yourself. 

If you are female, you have plenty of privilege. Men are not the devil. If you are appalled that when you got blackout drunk with strangers that bad things happened, take some ownership that you participated in that action.

Does it excuse it? No. 

Does it excuse you, and make your behavior reasonable and logical? No. 

You choose where you are going to be and what you are going to do then complain when you put yourself in a position that bad things often happen to people, that the bad thing happened to you. 

Once upon a time women would hitchhike, regularly, and things happened to them, like being found buried at a rest stop three hundred miles from where they were last seen. Was the murderer responsible for her death? Yup, you  *betchya*  he was. 

Was there a public outcry in which females threw tantrums and said that they should be able to hitchhike and be safe? That they should be able to get into the car with any random axe wielding stranger, and that person should just behave themselves because the girl is a special little flower of awesomeness? 

No. What happened? 

Word went around, you hitchhike, and bad things might happen, and many women were like, *fuck that shit. I’m not going to end up in a shallow grave,* and they knocked it off. Personal responsibility. 

Another thing ladies, we do not have the market cornered on rape, abuse, or being victimized. **Men have this happen to them all the time and they are actually dismissed and thought poorly of because of it.** 

**Men have been the victims of physical violence in homes, sexual violence, and emotional abuse from as many sources as women.** What is their recourse? Dismissal and being treated like they are not men for having had that happen. 

So rarely will I see a woman admit that a man can be raped by a male, or a female attacker. Erections are not voluntary, they happen regardless of interest, and women have as much a chance towards being a sexual predator as men. They just get away with it more often. 

**Rape.** Let’s talk about that for a second. The women out there, and you know who you are, that use rape and sexual harassment as a weapon and hide behind the SJW banner, **you embarrass the entire gender.** 

A man hitting on you is not equivalent to you being violated. 

A man looking at you does not violate your rights. 

Sexual harassment is a real issue and not one that should be taken lightly. No one should feel pressure to do anything against their will in order to keep a job, or a place to live, or anything else for that matter. However, saying no in your head and you thinking he should have known, **not rape.** 

A guy asking for your phone number, not harassment. You have every right to tell him to bugger off, and you have every right to leave.

**SJW crap is people looking for a problem because they have nothing better to do.** It’s tiresome and I have yet to hear one of their arguments that hasn’t made my eyes roll and me groan. Everyone wants to stand out and be special. In this day and age apparently that means having something to complain about. It’s always someone else’s problem. No one is responsible for themselves anymore. No one wants to be a mature adult, and everyone wants to be offended at everything. To that I defer to the words of Stephen Fry:

*“It's now very common to hear people say, 'I'm rather offended by that.' As if that gives them certain rights. It's actually nothing more... than a whine. 'I find that offensive.' It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. 'I am offended by that.' Well, so fucking what.""* **\~Stephen Fry**",8r2qhr,Hysteric_Blue,1528990086,191,MensRights,0.45243698,0.43450394,0.04233929
241,"This will come as no surprise to anyone here, but the media coverage of female teachers who rape and sexually assault male students is disgusting and doing a huge disservice to victims. It’s astonishing and barbaric to see such a lack of empathy and basic human decency, and yet it’s egregious, consistent and widespread. These crimes are normalized in the media as romances and romps, with an overall tone that directly and indirectly  portrays them as something sexy instead of abusive. The stories fill up with sickening comments about how lucky these boys are and how hot the teachers are. I could elaborate and do a better job communicating the ways in which this is harmful, but given that I’m preaching to the choir, I’ll save the manifesto for now and get to the point 

— 

There are a lot of people to point fingers at here, the justice system in particular. But the media has the largest accountability in influencing and perpetuating these societal views, and i feel strongly would be an easy target relative to other guilty parties. 

**I’m not usually one for hashtag campaigns and the like, but I think a grassroots effort could actually make an impact here. It’s a contained and achievable goal that wouldn’t require an unrealistic effort of time, coordination and mobility.**

Beyond the obvious fact that this is an important issue core to men’s rights that deserves attention - taking on this specific issue would be a smart strategic move for MRAs. Rallying around a positive, targeted, and non-controversial message that is focused on helping men and not attacking women is a way to get on the map and take control of the narrative surrounding the movement. Given that the majority of people calling out the rape apologists and general assholes on social media and in the comment sections of these articles are women, a lot of women are mothers of boys, and this is an issue that feminists care about too (please don’t argue with me on this one, lets not get derailed) — you would have the advantage of female support. 

I have no doubt that a rich talent pool exists in this sub covering strategy, creative, tech, copywriting, project management and other skills and expertise necessary to execute something meaningful in a short amount of time with a low commitment and zero budget.

This is a large group with a diverse spread of ages and locations, many on campuses with built-in audiences. If you tap into that organic reach and leverage everyone’s combined influencer and media connections, there is a huge opportunity for a well-executed campaign to reach a viral tipping point.

That’s my pitch.

243,"Well when you have women doing stupid things like being ""sexist"" rude to men, and then making you wait, and wait and wait - while women coming in after you, in drips and drabs, get seated first, and then you get teeny portions of relatively ho-hum EXPENSIVE food, and to top it off, they then try on THEIR OWN 18% man tax..... What? It said $10 a serve on the board / menu and your now asking me to pay nearly $12... No deal. 

You cannot advertise one price and charge another HIGHER price. And you cannot pull this stunt on the basis of gender. If they pull this conjob on you, just get up and walk out. Don't argue - leave their dishonest money sponging from the men,  where it belongs - with them.

They justify this stunt on the basis of the debunked ""wage gap"" - the only reason there is a difference in average earnings between men and women is the women habitually choose lower paying jobs, that require lower standards of qualifications and the women typically work less hours. That is an issue of personal choice, not discrimination.  

There is NO mythical female ""wage gap"". Never was, never has been.

They say their man gouging man tax - is being ""humorously"" passed over,  as  a fund raising to a feminist charity.  So they are inventing stories from the feminist echo chamber, about the fictitious wage gap issue and gouging the guys - they are just liars and thieves.

You should not be trading with people who blatantly deceive the customers.

The funny thing about their justification for gouging the guys is that these women are pulling an extortion racket, by imposing upon MEN the expectation to cough up the cash on demand, to fund the multibillion dollar feminist financial leeching  industry, and yet these empowered couch potatoes running the place, don't and won't do it themselves...

They also demand ""cash payment"" into the good will jar - but while they say they donate what they graft from the men, the largest demographic for shoplifting and stealing and fiddling the books in a broad scale lower cost basis, is women. So while they lie about the wage gap issue from the feminist echo chamber, they con the men into paying 18% more for the meals, and they tell us they donate the money to feminist charities, but everything they tell the customers is a lie, and cash is a very liquid and disposable resource, and women are the highest demographic for shop lifting. 

So can they prove what they con from the men, is actually making it to the ""feminist charity"", or indeed that the feminist charity is not themselves.

Since the average customer cannot prove that they are, and they are lying to the customers from the outset, would I believe that they are actually trustworthy with any conjob derived donation? I don't think so.

263,"All those talks about toxic masculinity are not entirely off the mark. Where I draw the line with feminists is that I do believe women have a crucial role in causing it: they expect from men qualities such as stoicism, confidence, self-reliance, a good amount of social dominance and those things are not easy to get per se and the escalating and stressing competition to be the most stoic, the most confident and successfully providing man is what leads to toxic masculinity.  I also believe that women are to a strong degree hardwired to look for those qualities in men just like men value youth in women as a marker of fertility.   

Feminists and regressive leftists don't acknowledge this reality and deceive men with false hopes in the power of socialization that they believe will correct and change our core sexual nature in a couple of generations or so. Oddly enough you don't see them really involved in encouraging women to make any real effort to change their sexual preferences.  Every time they talk about TM they should always address women's role in shaping it and push for women to drastically change what they look for in a man, assuming it's possible, which I'm not sure it is. It might be as far fetched as asking men to be physically attracted to old women. So what's the point of inciting men to drop those negative traits of masculinity when they won't be rewarded with sexual and romantic partnership from women?

265,"Hi,
  Happy Father's day! I want to preface this with what I am not looking to do. First, this isn't a witch hunt, nor am I grossly offended and want to rise against this horrible injustice delt to dad's everywhere. 

  I think the proper corse to take as to not come across as the very thing we do not want to be would be to take the following as an opportunity to raise awareness regarding the inequalites men face and how it effects our children. 

  I found out today from my 10yo while opening my father's day presents from them that their school did not have a school store event for father's day. At the school store, kids can buy presents for the special day involved for a menial fee. It encourages the kids to think about their presents, then take ownership and pride in their thoughtfulness. 

  Alone, no store is ok. However they did have one for mother's day. I got thinking and I am not angry, however the father/daughter fance has been taken away due to the gender locked nature of it, and having a school store for moms and not dads is really sending a message that fathers do not matter as much to the kids. It was the responsibility of the parent's group to organize this event as it was for mother's day. 

  I could whine to the principal, he is a good dude and would apologize, however I think there is more to it, and the awareness of this iceberg is important for the kids. 

  It seems like a fine line to tip-toe to deliver the message, but also feels like I should take some action since we never seem to have a voice or choice in these things. Any thoughts are appreciated. ",8ruyuz,Stoicdadman,1529278204,8,MensRights,0.25462922,0.09270445,0.08396416

268,"I'd suggest heading over to the Wikipedia article just to have a look if you're not familiar with the case, but a few quotes always stuck with me.

His initial challenge to the state of Michigan about opting out of fatherhood as an analogue to women opting out of motherhood was strong. Women in Michigan are *not required to pay child support payments under any circumstances*. The argument was that Dubay should not have to either, especially given the circumstances where he was lead to believe his partner was infertile and on contraception.

Dubay's attorney was damn near mobbed in court when the National Organization for Women made an appearance to defend the state claiming that once a child is born its need for care is outweighed by any circumstances surrounding birth. Of course ignoring the female-privileging child support law.

A rough example of a future ""paper abortion"" was given for example in court, to show that it could stand to be a right practiced by men in the future that wouldn't harm women but would give them the question of whether or not to carry to term. Roe v. Wade was referenced quite a bit. The National Center for Men ended up taking it upon themselves to try and overturn the ruling and set ground for men's reproductive equality. There were a lot of parallels except for one damning, cold, resounding quote that will tell you everything you need to know about men's position in society:

""...the Fourteenth Amendment does not deny to the State the power to treat different classes of persons in different ways.""

Men are a different class. The Fourteenth Amendment, written primarily to protect recently freed *slaves* from certain mistreatment couldn't be applied to protect men's rights to their lives. The clause in question most was the Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which in effect should grant all citizens the same protections afforded by law. So it was plainly stated, though, that men are a different class. It could be inferred that men are a sort of ""utility"" class and the state shall use them as they see fit. It could be inferred that women are a sort of ""protected"" class like they've always been and it was at this moment the high and mighty Supreme Court of the United States of America, supposed paragon of equality and ""justice for all"" was cornered into having to admit *men aren't equal to women and shall not enjoy the rights and privileges that the higher class of women may have*. Gynocentrism had to call itself by its own name in public.

This is why the Men's Rights Movement will be, until it succeeds, and it will succeed, an unpopular movement. The State cannot fathom supporting it and accepting it has been oppressing and subjugating one half of the population while pampering and tending to the other. Society at large has enjoyed the benefits of having half the population be forced into a class of conscription-targeted, labor-classed, living ATMs and couldn't comprehend that real equality would mean giving both sides equal rights *and* responsibilities.

Happy Father's Day, we've got a hell of a lot to say and do before we get to where things should be. Stay strong and stay informed. The population will learn the facts kicking and screaming before it bows its head and accepts what equality should look like, we just need to have those facts ready and well-presented.",8rwawy,GreyTortoise,1529291271,111,MensRights,0.055768944,0.024768941,0.008194493

277,"I’m so tired of women complaining about “the pay gap”. While it doesn’t really exist at my day-job (more of a gap in how many senior partners are men vs. women), I had my first opportunity to witness how men and women behave according to gender roles in a while after overseeing the production for a company I’m an active owner of today. 

Due to machine packaging issues, we decided to pay for weekly labor to hand-package our ice cream product to get out the first pallets for summer (highly seasonal product, needs to enter market now since we were already behind schedule). We hired three women (20-35 years old) and three 17 year old high school boys - the girls get by on day labor, for the guys it’s more of a summer job. By all means, they all entered equally - all had to be explained the process Monday, no previous experience with the product. 

The tasks:
Box prep: take ice cream from freezer, fill a cardboard box with the ice cream pillow pack and novelty item and stage them in a box to be processed by the box gluing machine. This is the most time intensive role, so we have three people doing this at all time. 

Machine operator: receive boxes, place it in a boxing machine, dictate workflow. This is a fast-paced role, you are the choke point of production.

Final product boxer:
Receive finished products and fill out boxes for pallet

Flex:
Take finish product filled boxes, tape shut, put boxes back in freezer. Also makes boxes for finished product boxer and gets more ice cream for box prep team, also dictates work flow. This is also a fast paced role, also physically demanding. 

First thing I noticed was how each gender approached taking unfamiliar tasks. All of the guys wanted to operate the packaging machine. There was one kid that took the flex position really seriously and performed all tasks with great enthusiasm. The girls wanted to sit together in box prep, where their individual performance was hard to measure. The guys rotate amongst themselves to avoid repetition fatigue. The only role the girls wanted to operate was the finished product boxer. 

The second thing I noticed was enthusiasm. I get it, it’s not the best job in the world, but we are paying everyone $15/hour and I’m taking them to lunch. The guys are competitive about getting more done today than yesterday and constantly looking for ways to improve the process. The guys are constantly asking about the business and trying to connect with me personally. The women are just sticking to their tasks and for the most part, keeping their heads down.

Lastly, falling into assigned gender roles. The women never want to go into the freezer and pick up ice cream. Even though the boxes are not heavy, they constantly bark orders at the guys to grab more ice cream and the materials they need to box. They don’t leave their seats unless everyone else is tied up. 

It’s a quick summary, I’m sure I missed a few details, but I just got back into Manhattan and need to catch drinks with a pal of mine. 

In short, I am definitely hiring all guys next week. ",8sdnd2,TiredBanker,1529451834,49,MensRights,0.112643376,0.035443626,0.0067251488

287,"There is an extreme level of hatred being promoted by western women against ""straight white men.""   Their own men.   These rhetorical attacks are increasingly translating into actual policy.   For example the NDP in Canada is trying to prevent ""straight white men"" from running for vacated seats.   In London, a recent labor party youth conference barred straight white males from attending.   

Most of this hatred actually comes from white women.   

What's the fucking deal?   These white women have straight white fathers, uncles, brothers, even sons.   

I can't imagine a significant number of white men getting together and saying ""white women suck.   Let's blame all of society's problems on them.""  

I understand the theoretical basis for these attacks.   Women have been falsely taught that their men oppressed them throughout history; and in various western countries minorities were subject to discrimination (including, it should be stressed, white ethnic minorities like Irish people).   But times have changed, and historical discrimination against minorities still doesn't account for the sheer level of hatred being leveled against white males by white women.  

Middle and upper class white women are possibly the most privileged group of people to have ever existed.   They have achieved this privilege due mostly to the efforts of white men.   Yet there is no gratitude, appreciation, thankfulness.   Just hate or indifference.    

I'm not that interested in political theories, because traditional leftist women didn't behave this way.  

I just don't understand how these white women can get up on television and attack ""straight white males"" -- and even support overt discrimination against them -- then go home and make lunch for their straight white male sons.   Think of that MP Jess Phillips laughing at male suicide.   That bitch has sons!   I always had a romantic idea of mothers (my mother is awesome) -- the grizzly bear defending her cubs and all that.   But a startlingly large number of modern women appear to have no concept of loyalty at all -- even to their own children!   

Attacks against ""straight white males"" are essentially a form of virtue signaling for modern pseudo-leftist women.   But again, it makes little sense to me how or why they would throw their own sons under the bus simply to virtue signal.   This seems to fly in the face of evolutionary biology.   Or perhaps there's some sort of abstraction going on that men don't understand?  

I remember a tweet by the incorrigible British feminist Laurie Pennie where she defended the hashtag ""men are trash.""   Someone replied ""so your father is trash?""   She got irate, saying that her father was a lovely person.   So ""men"" exist for her as an abstraction, whereas the MAN, her father, is a real human being.   Weird stuff.   

I guess a ""red pill"" explanation would be that women don't really have a concept of ""loyalty"", at least not to the extent that men do.   When Alexander the Great or Genghis Khan conquered a village and slaughtered all the men, the women had to adapt and learn to love their conquerers.   But this still doesn't explain how so many white women are willing to throw their own sons under the bus.  

Another explanation is that women grossly overestimate male power.   Since the ""ideal"" man is someone who is basically invulnerable to attack, women have a tendency to think men as a group should be able to take whatever is thrown at them.   But even boys?   

Honestly I just can't figure it out.   Perhaps the explanation is exceedingly mundane: a significant percentage of white women have been spoiled rotten, and are acting just like you'd expect spoiled children-cum-adults to act.   They are snarky, bitter, entitled, perpetually dissatisfied, and completely lacking in character.   The *majority* of white women aren't like this, but they just sort of go along with the herd (?)

Girl from sales comes in, I'm sitting at a table with my back to her while she's behind me at a counter heating her lunch in the microwave. She backs her ass up to where it's pretty much on my shoulder and pulls one ass cheek up to rub her pussy on me through her pants. I'm immediately feeling sick and getting a painfully uncomfortable erection, I move away from her some and look at her, she's looking back at me smiling and I can't take it. I leave my food there, grab my lunch bag and leave the break room immediately, back to the service department. I sit in the bathroom in the garage and collect myself. I brushed it off pretty well, she was just being extremely out of line and probably didn't know I have a girlfriend. But it hit me.

I've been falsely accused before and been cleared with video evidence and the accuser being caught mixing up her lies. Since then I've continued practicing the Billy Graham rule but this was a particular slip-up. It's not hard avoiding being alone with women where she can claim anything she wants and ""believe her"" will ultimately win. However, this was a big time slip. I was alone with her, in a part of the dealership with very little surveillance, and was away from cameras for about thirty or forty minutes total.

I thought being falsely accused once was just a fluke but now that I've been treated like this I'm worried. I rejected her advances, ruthlessly, even. I'm now worried her feelings of rejection might turn to accusations for revenge. I'm pretty fucked as far as evidence goes but my character references should hold me up if she tries anything. But I know how this goes, I've been around this once before and this is a multi-million dollar local dealership chain and she works in sales. The company needs to save face and they don't care how they do it.

I think I'd just off myself, I don't know. I keep running it through my head and thinking maybe I should have just told her no, or maybe I should have appeased her somehow, and I just feel dirty and shitty thinking about it like that. It can't really be this rotten out there, can it? I'm an MRA and it still is hard to wrap my head around how powerless I am in this. I don't know what to do, and I'm not sure there is anything I can do or anything I could have done better other than staying away from women. I feel so fucking sick, my buddy is gone for the weekend doing side work and I guess all I can do is study auto tech and play video games. Keep my mind preoccupied.

303,"
A few weeks ago I was having tea with a good friend who spent time in prison during his youth. Out of nowhere I asked him if he would come to my house and review some letters that my father sent me from prison back in the '80s. ""I can't figure these out and maybe you can make sense of them,""  ""I told him. 

He was initially put-off by the request but indulged me once he realized it was important to me. He dutifully read the letters but shook his head, ""I'm not getting anything,"" he said.  ""I think you're looking for answers to questions that can't be answered."" 

""But why?"" I asked. 

""I think you hope that if you ask the right questions you will eventually find some answers that will lead you to your father.""

My father was a known criminal from the United States who was in prison there from the time of my birth until his death in the early 2000s. I never knew him but I grew up with constant reminders of who he was. Furthermore, I never had a stepfather or even a positive male role model during my formative years - all of my caregivers were women. 

I never thought much about any of this as I didn't know anything else. The concept of ""father"" in relation to myself didn't compute. When people expressed sympathy I would say, ""I can't really miss what I never had."" 

However, in recent months I've experienced a series of major life events and interactions that have opened my eyes to this incomprehensible sense of grief and loss that I've carried for life as a result of these circumstances.  

I had a very difficult childhood and early adulthood and I believe this was a result of fatherlessness. 

The chaotic nature of life prevented me from addressing or identifying this issue. However, I've recently achieved some major life goals including a well-paid job in a career that I enjoy. The war is over, the smoke has cleared and all is well... or so I thought. 

I'm just shy of my 37th birthday and I'm dealing with this grief for the first time in my life. 

It has hit me like a fucking tidal wave and I'm overcome by this groundswell of raw grief right from the core of my being. It is unlike anything I have ever experienced before. More than anything I wanted the love, support, guidance and physical affection of a father but that never happened. In its absence I am left with this fucking grief... 

I recently picked up a copy of the **Boy Crisis** by Warren Farrell in an attempt to better understand my grief. The first part of the book articulates why boys need fathers as well as the long-term impacts of fatherlessness. However, the remainder of the book seems to be a ""how to parent boys"" manual. 

There really isn't any advice for people like myself who won't ever have a father. I went to my library and there were a lot of books for fatherless women but nothing for men like myself. 

I do plan to pursue psychotherapy but in the meantime I would like to read some helpful books on the subject. Additionally, it would also be helpful to explore support groups.

Anyways, thanks for reading my long-winded screed. I am grateful for any and all suggestions. ",8tnnck,ThereAreThings,1529900241,23,MensRights,0.09828771,0.029714199,0.014048163

308,"How should men react to blanket generalizations about their gender? Most men respond in one of three ways. Some say nothing. Some men may apologize for their gender. Some may try to persuade the generalizer that ``not all men"" are bad. The phrase #notallmen has been subjected to much mockery since 2013. In 2014, a comic by Matt Lubchansky described Mr. Notallmen as a caricature MRA. The vast majority of MRAs would argue that Mr. Notallmen serves a good purpose, since he reminds everyone of the fact that there are good men. I belong to the minority who do not find him helpful -- explanation follows.

Most people understand that a racist who blames all members of a minority for the crimes of the few is evil and reprehensible. Most child abuse is committed by women including mothers like Casey Anthony, or Raina Mersane who stabbed 8 children to death. Yet, anyone who tars non-abusive mothers with the same brush would be held in contempt. Blaming all men for the faults of the few is evil and reprehensible. This point should be obvious to any decent human. Someone who slanders all men is not misguided, or irrational, or emotional, or a snowflake. Someone who slanders all men is a slanderer and the enemy.

Male bashing and man hating has been fashionable in Western Culture at least since 1990s. While many factors have contributed to this cultural shift, Mr. Notallmen's role should be analyzed. Negotiating with bigots and slanderers is as counterproductive as negotiating with terrorists. Many Liberals justifiably condemned some foreign wars conducted by USA, yet #notone of them asked what do they have to do in order to be considered good people by terrorists. There are Conservative members of minorities who support racists' freedom, yet #none of them would apologize to racists for belonging to a minority. We should be grateful to women who defend male victims of abuse and discrimination, yet #none of them would agree with a man who blames all women. When many real men like the comic character Mr. Notallmen ask bigots what they can do to be counted as good men by bigot's standards they are encouraging bigotry.

One criticism of Mr. Notallmen is that he is making women's lived experiences about men -- thus we should take a look at the personal experiences of those who blame all men. Most women, like most men are good people. According to ``Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury Between Relationships With Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner Violence"" published in American Journal of Public Health, only 16% of women and 7% of men have been violent toward a nonviolent partner. It is unreasonable to assume that a random woman or man has experience of abusing their partner or children. Nevertheless, any person who uses abusive or bigoted language is more likely then not to be a perpetrator of child abuse and intimate partner abuse. Most abusers engage in more then one type of abuse. Thus, it should be assumed that any individual slandering all men has lived experience as an abuser.

Mr. Notallmen is trying to prove that men have goodness by the standards of the slanderers and abusers who have no goodness themselves. In conclusion, men must understand that most of them are good -- but not by the standards of evil. ",8u65oc,Wanderer15,1530068621,9,MensRights,0.14429577,0.04442204,0.008039144

But is it wrong that I hear the hysterics of, ""They'll take away women's rights to choose,"" as, ""Don't expect us to have the same options as men!""

You made a choice, and now there are consequences. Is it really the end of the world to face an unplanned pregnancy the way the most men are forced to do so, regardless of what is inconvenient for you personally? Choices come with consequences, so why not ""woman up"" and do what society expects of you to do? I get that there is added consequences regarding her body and complications. But can we not ask these questions of women, when nobody appears to ask them in terms of men?

318,"Frequently in the media, I hear #MeToo called a movement for equality, that women are finally being taken seriously in the light of the Harvey Weinstein scandal (as if we didn't know this about Hollywood) I consider it nothing of the sort; it's a growing moral panic. 

What does it mean when a woman posts #Metoo? It's never said; it's just a hashtag. Depending on who posts it, it can mean anything from being gang-raped in a dark alley to a guy who flirts with you in a clumsy way. 

Now do I think women posting these online are lying? For most of them, I'd say no. What I will say is that it frequently doesn't men what a passerby thinks it means. Generally, it's assumed they'd been raped, and since over 10 million of these were posted in the first day, many made that very same assumption. In fact, it covers a much broader range of behavior: it can also mean being catcalled or hit on when going about their daily routine. Aggravating, I'm sure, but not remotely in the same category as rape and assault and it's insulting to women and men who had been forced to survive it.

I've noticed that moral panics have one thing in common: they cannot be criticized, cannot be questioned, and anyone who does must be destroyed at all costs. The first example that comes to mind is Matt Damon, who stated that it was going too far, that there was a difference between predatory behavior and a clumsy attempt to ask someone out. The internet lynch mob demanded his head, tried to destroy his career, and would not relent until he repented of his ""sin"". 

Think of Matt Taylor, who ended up being ruined because someone took offense at a shirt he had worn to work, one that a female friend had actually made for him.

I've read numerous articles from feminist websites claiming that any backlash against this is nothing more than a misogynistic-motivated witch hunt from the Patriarchy. Then there's all the claims on social media: we're finally being taken seriously, yet there are still efforts to silence us. 

Even some feminists are criticizing it, such as Margaret Atwood, but from what I've seen, this panic is far from over. And it's having lasting effects, such as many men going out of their way to avoid a woman at work, never to be seen alone with her. If you make a joke that can be interpreted as dirty or sexist, one of the people you tell it too can take offense and get you fired and your reputation destroyed. And men have good reason to fear this; there is no defense against a sexual harassment accusation. If someone gets offended or disturbed by a joke or an attempt to ask someone out, it's suddenly #MeToo

**I can't help but be reminded of an old Saturday Night Live skit called ""Sexual Harassment and you"" regarding how to avoid being accused of harassment:**

**""Be handsome""**

**""Be attractive""**

**""Don't be unattractive""** 

I'll conclude with a quote from a book written by a brilliant man: Disclosure, by Michael Crichton.  

""And of course there were new rules for men in business as well. Sanders knew men who would not take a business trip with a woman, who would not sit next to a female colleague in an airplane , who would not meet a woman for a drink in a bar unless someone else was also present. Sanders always used to think that such caution was extreme, even paranoid; now he was not so sure."" This was a man ahead of his time.  

And this shows every sign of getting worse... ",8us7ex,Philip8000,1530269585,42,MensRights,0.28312725,0.10440776,0.06626215
319,"First, I want to lead with: I get it. I get the view that we should not immediately discard someone's claims that a crime occured, but I believe we should always be skeptics. But also, there is no reason to be a skeptic to their face about it. So, yes, we can support an alleged victim, but we do not need to believe them. Notice the word 'alleged' used, because nothing has been proven at this point, the alleged victim becomes a known victim after proof.

So, what is my problem? I think that ""believing the victim"" has 3 things that must, logically, also be believed at the same time:

1. That the act happened.
2. That the act was a crime.
3. That the accused perpetrator (if any) is guilty.

If we ""believe the victim"" who claims rape, we acknowledge their version of truth, which means that we acknowledge that a crime happened, which then assumes that the perpetrator is already guilty.

So then, what should we do? Support the victim? No, we are still presuming that the individual is a victim, therefore that a crime occurred and that there is a perpetrator.

How about what people have always done, be there for your friends and family? You can be there and support your friends and family whether they were wronged or not, whether they are victims or not.",8utawf,Historybuffman,1530280485,12,MensRights,0.049831573,0.023995465,0.009411395
320,"So this happened today. I have a really good friend, as in I have known him for many many years and been a willing sound board for his problems with his relationships. He has been in love with a certain woman for a couple years and it was clear to me from the start that his love was not returned. It has only become worse as years went on. Exponentially worse. This guy has been so far into the friend zone that I can barely describe it and he just refuses to believe that his love will never be returned.

First, let me make this clear. We are not talking about a man in college or even his 20's. We are not talking about a social reject. We are talking about a man in his 40's, who has been married and has a couple children, who graduated from a very elite college with a very advanced science degree, who has been employed ever since at a very high income, who has lots of male and female friends, who is well known in a pretty exclusive community. He is also pretty cute. No real problem getting dates.

He might be just a little bit on the spectrum but I have heard the same kinds of things from other male friends. This delusional belief. ""Sure, she says she is only my friend now, but if I can just do A, B, C and D, she is going to love me. We are made for each other. I have listened to her. She wants A, B, C and D. I can do that. I can be that. I just need to try harder.""

""No, dude, no"", I say. "" It's all about chemistry and for her the chemistry is not there. You can't do romance like a recipe. The right amounts of A, B, C and D do not add up to E. If she keeps saying that you are just a friend it is way past time for you to start believing that."" Maybe it is the science mentality but I don't really think so. I have seen this before with other male friends. This endless search for the right formula for romance. Like it is a math project or something.

This endless questioning of themselves since they believe that they made some or more mistakes and ""did not do it right"" which is why they have been denied romance with their loved one. They just need some way to fix it, OK? ""Look, I really don't think you can fix it. Every chick flick movie in the world says different, but let's get real. No chemistry means no romance.""

Hmm. So what was my very good friend, and a very smart and decent person, beating himself up about his not yet realized ""romance"" today? What did he decide he did wrong? Which is why he still hasn't gotten laid (after years) from the love of his life today? Well, he took her into NYC for her birthday and spent many thousands of dollars on dinner and a show and a limo. Everything was going great. She seemed really into it. They were definitely going to finally have sex (after years) that night, according to him. Their romance was going to finally get on track. (He already bought the ring, by the way.)

Except whoops, just whoops, some other man made a play for her in the after hours bar. (Now maybe this is not polite to say, but I am a damn good looking woman and random men at bars do not make a play for me when I am with another man. You would have to send out a special signal for that. Contrary to popular belief, men will wait for a signal. They don't just randomly storm the barriers.) So random and bigger physically man made a play, my friend tried to shut it down, it got a little hostile and random man made a derogatory remark about friend's genitalia.

Hmm. ""The ""yeah, we are just friends"" woman said to my friend, ""Let's get out of here now. Don't pay the check. It's time to go."" Friend, being a decent and law abiding citizen, decided he better pay the more than $500. check first. (Champagne is expensive.) Ducked a fight and went up to do that. ""I should have taken her and left right then"", he says to me. ""That's what she wanted. We would have had sex (finally) that night if I just would have done that. Or maybe got into a fight."" ""You would have been arrested and in jail that night if you had just done that"", I say, trying to inject some rationality into this conversation. ""Nope, you certainly did not screw up here by following the law and you did not have to get into some fight with a random stranger in a very elite NYC restaurant to prove your macho or something.""

Except love of his life went home and told him (not for the first time) that she never wanted to see him again. Blocked him on the phone and all social media. Friend, being so invested in this love of his life relationship, following every romantic movie ever made, decides not to take no for an answer. (For like the 500th time.) Except I am friend's de facto attorney. I see it going down bad. And I am afraid. I am damn fucking afraid of a restraining order. It's so easy to get and so hard to fight. He won't be able to continue in his chosen profession if I ever let a restraining order get finalized against him.

And the facts are so bad, really. You did what exactly, while she was dissing you off all the time and saying you were just friends? While she still of course was accepting expensive jewelry and expensive dates to restaurants and pretending that maybe one day you were going to get engaged off the Brooklyn bridge. Oh great! Just F'ing great! I am a really good trial lawyer, but I didn't raise the moon, ok? And I am afraid.

You umm joined her gym so you could be there every time she worked out? You like took yoga classes at the gym because she did and you must have noticed the classes were 99 percent women or something. You joined her dance classes so she had to dance with you? You went to every meet-up she signed up to? You umm went to her hairdresser and scheduled your appointments to coincide with her's? You got your drugs at the same drug store? You actually f'ing moved to be closer to her! You like showed up on practically a daily basis to say that you were in the coffee shop across from her apartment and had bought her a latte and some roses and wanted to deliver them to her door?

F'ng shit, dude. F'ing shit. You look like a stalker.

I am just waiting for it to go down. I am the de facto attorney. That's my friend damn it and he meant no harm. I know it is going down. Just have to do my best to contain the damage. He will likely never work again if I am not successful. There are maybe some defenses. Well, if you have a good imagination and we get the right judge.

Except not the actual defenses I need. The defense that this woman relentlessly led him on for her own benefit for years? Nope, no good in court. The defense that she rooked him out of 10K or more pretending that maybe one day she would be his girlfriend? Collecting more than 10K in jewelry and don't even get me started on the rest. Nope, no good in court. The defense that he was always her back up plan at the bar for a ride home in case nobody else bit? Nope, no good in court. The defense that she showed up naked three times in his bed and when she backed off he didn't try to do anything? Cause they were just friends. /s Nope, no good in court. I mean she really did keep telling him that. Why won't he get the message? /s

Going to stop this rant now. Cause I need to get to court. She has a new boyfriend. (Pity him, really.) She's playing the victim now. F'ing shit, dude, after being told 50 times (lately) not to contact her, after she has blocked you on her phone, on her Facebook, on Instagram, on all social media sites. You need to send her a damn letter to get closure?

Well, a judge is going to give you some damn closure. I am afraid of that. Look around, do you see Meg Ryan in this movie? No, you don't, because it is not a movie. Between you and me and the internet, I represent the real victim here. I represent the real victim. I just can't say that in court.

Edit: A de facto attorney is one who you know from family and close friends and one you don't pay for. I am not only the first attorney he is going to call to bail him out. I am the only attorney.

322,"There's a story floating around reddit of a 16 year old guy getting a 13 year old girl pregnant. Immediately, the discussion turns to how disgusting and creepy this guy is for having sex with the 13 year old, and how that could technically count as statutory rape. Even after learning that the girl *asked* the guy to have sex with her, all of the anger is still pointed at the male. Why? Don't get me wrong, I think what happened was a mistake, but it is an EQUAL mistake on the part of the girl and the boy. They BOTH agreed to have sex, and they BOTH didn't take necessary precautions, and she is pregnant now. And even though the girl has the option to abort or put up for adoption, much of the discussion is diverted to how they can garnish the wages of a kid who probably hasn't even had his first job yet.

You could argue that the 16 year old should have known better than the 13 year old, but in the end they are both kids, and it's impossible to know the emotional maturity of each child. But the fact that this discussion immediately turned into ""bash the man"" is indicative of a greater problem.

328,"I'm posting this story to provide another account that women get free passes from their detrimental actions. This story is a bit long but if you want to know exactly what happened I recommend you read through it. Tl;dr at the bottom.

So today I was sitting inside my house and I started to think about something that had been on my mind lately. I was thinking about the fact that my older sister (26) stole 20$ from my 12 year old nephew. 

My mother had already confronted her about this and my sister said ""I have a coin in storage worth 20$, I'll pay it back that way."" That was about a month ago and there was still no sign of money. I got tired of this because she was the one who stole from my nephew and now he also had to wait to get what was ultimately his in the first place.

I go over to her as she is napping on the couch and I ask her ""Hey, where is my fridge I let you borrow?""(I also wanted to know about this because I let her borrow it and I found out from my mom that she actually sold it to someone else.) She mumbles something about ""Robert....It's with.....I have it in...storage"". This is somewhat of a lie because I know she sold it to Robert but he probably had it in storage. Assault Sister had been living with my other sister and her husband Robert so a lot of their stuff was in storage together. I said ""Okay, where is the 20 bucks?"" She frowned and seemed confused so I said ""Not mine, Charles'"" and she says to me basically what she said to my mom ""I have a coin worth 20 dollars in storage"". So I asked in a more insistent voice ""So when are you going to get it?"" This is where things start to take a heavy turn.

She starts getting more upset and starts to get up asking ""Soo....did you really come over to say that to me?"" So I say back ""Yeah"" in a firm voice. From there she escalates the argument with personal insults and threatens to kick me in the balls. I know I can just call the cops on her (or so I thought) so I start saying ""Do it! Do it and I'll call the cops on you! You won't."" From there she begins to further dish out personal insults and I'll admit that I did too, getting heated and screaming myself. I meant everything I said to her but I should've handled the situation with more control. That in *no way* justifies her actions though. Eventually, she just loses it and starts trying to wail on me. I'm not going to hit a woman and go to jail and I'm certainly not going to make her daughter watch me try to hurt her like that. So she's trying her best with rage to punch me in the face and I'm doing my best to avoid injury and thwart her punches. She corners me and I trip and land on box containing clothes. She's still trying to punch me with all her might and I'm still pushing her hands away and bobbing and weaving my head. I see an opening and I start to pull her head down to mess up her shots as she's at the end of my feet. After that I start kicking my feet into her to get her off me, she backs off a little and her boyfriend starts pulling her back.

During all this my mother was insisting that we stop but we both tuned her out. I was in a dilemma because I wanted to give my mom peace but my sister acts like this every time someone calls her out, even with family. I decided to persist on verbally defending myself as she kept spewing out insults after the first physical altercation. After a while though I abandoned the argument and said in Spanish ""Alright, alright. I am going to stop right now. Let's see if you can do the same!"" and I walked away. Of course she continues to keep on talking shit to me and I turn around to insult her back from across the apartment. Then another turn of events takes place.

My mother goes up to me again asking me to please stop and at this point I was very agitated. I turned my mother around and with my finger tips tried to guide her away from me. I was still pumping with adrenaline so what I thought was gentle actually pushed her a little bit. This was of course unintentional and an accident (I actually apologized to my mother about it later on. Thank god she didn't get hurt.) but my sister didn't think so. She says ""Oh you're you're pushing my mom?"" and proceeds to try and fight me again. However, this time I was in a door way and her daughter could see everything. As my sister tried to assault me I heard her cry out while looking at her mom. I glanced at her and seeing her sad face hurt me inside despite the punches being thrown at me. Again her boyfriend came to pull her back and my mother used the opportunity to get in between us. At that point we just went back to yelling at each other.

She finally recedes from the situation while still yelling about things that I don't even remember. She has just assaulted me two times so I decide now is the time to call the police on her. I go to pick up the phone, dial 911 and hit call. Immediately, my other sister pulls out the phone line because she doesn't want my sister to go jail and thinks that our mother might be deported.

I decided that I wasn't going to let it end like this so I go outside to my apartment complex to find someone who will let me use a phone. I knock on the first door in front of the apartment. No answer. They had probably heard us and didn't feel safe opening. I decide to go to a door that couldn't have heard us. A Hispanic lady answers and says in Spanish that she has no wifi. Now that I think of it she was probably scared too and thought I wanted to come in the apartment not use the phone outside. I got a little discouraged, started ranting with myself and burst into a run. I headed for the leasing office thinking that there has to be an available phone there. No one was there so I walked over to some folk at the pool and asked lady if she had a phone I could use. She said no but she actually seemed honest. She spoke in Spanish and asked if I was okay (I still didn't know how my face looked), I said ""Me? Yeah I'm fine."" ""What happened to you?"" ""I can't tell you right now"" and I left.

I had a spark of realization that I could still use my cellphone that had no service because it was an emergency call. I pick up my phone, step outside and call the police. This time it goes through and an African American lady takes me through the steps of getting help. Apparently the Police was already here and the first call had actually gone through. There had been a fatal shooting in the apartments two days prior (which I had no idea about and was shocked to know) so the moment the 911 call was cut they immediately sent someone over. 

The officer did his job and began asking us questions about the situation, separately. After I explained everything he asked me ""Alright so what is it you're wanting me to do?"". I requested that she go to jail for a night so she learns she can't act that way. The police officer, as nice as he was, says ""Well man, we take abusive husbands to jail for 6 months and when they come out they do it again."" He then asks me if she lives here (she doesn't) and I said she'd be gone in about a week or two. This was also the first time anyone has called the cops on her so he probably assumed it was an isolated incident. I'm guessing he thought she wouldn't be a problem again in the future and let her drive off with her boyfriend to his place past state lines.

Thanks for reading, I just wanted to share my story.

His wife always gives him shit for stuff e.g a year ago he told her he would be going to hang out with this friend who was trans and she was like noo u cant trust such people and she got into a fight and she played the victim role and crying in the end so my bro had to hide shit from her.

When i talked to him about it he told me she is nice but coincidentally I happen to be around when she is in a bad mood. Even if its true, atleast respect ur partner enough to not act like a bitch in front of his family member.
Cos of her attitude and my brother's need to keep her away from any embarrassment he faces at work, home etc. My bro started keeping lots of secrets from her about our family's treatment towards him, his past, things he has done etc and when she came to know abt it through someone else with evidence she got upset and started crying. Which i believe is reasonable. My brother shouldnt have kept so many secrets from her. I would have gotten pissed off too so here i support her.

I just figured she was being nosy about what I was doing so I shrugged it off.  We had fun for a while, just relaxing and walking around the city. But after a bit we were planning on ubering home, and she ended up snatching my phone when I had lost signal while trying to direct us home. I was not comfortable with this so I asked for it back nicely repeatedly. After about 2 minutes of her not giving it back I started telling her to. She shoved me and punched me and started yelling at me. Now mind you we are in a highly populated city so this is already pretty embarrassing. Eventually I reach over to grab my phone back and she ends up punching me several times in the face and she throws and breaks my phone on the floor while screaming at me. Crowds of onlookers stare and she starts yelling, ""YOU DON'T HIT ME, YOU DON'T EVER LAY YOUR HANDS ON A WOMAN."" I was not so upset at this statement because I have never laid hands on a woman or a man. But regardless security comes over and asks the lady who they saw throw and break my phone as well as attack me if she is alright and asked her what was going on. She lies and tells them that we're in a relationship that she's ending, and that she was just trying to guide us home when I attacked her for having my phone. Security asked her if she'd like to press charges and she has the audacity to tell me that she's doing me a favor by saying no.

That said, I don't think that means everyone who wears the banner ""feminist"" is somehow an enemy of men.

334,"My first child was just born, which is very exciting. The hospital room is really nice, and all the nurses are so kind and supportive. However, there's a few discrepancies which stick out to me a bit, things that make the father feel a bit unwanted.

1. Nice room, classy furniture, big TV, and yet no real second bed or even cot for the other parent? Here's a reclining chair, enjoy your next 3 nights!

2. Single voucher for one meal for the other parent. It just feels odd to have my wife order dinner every night and then I have to leave to go find my own food since the hospital cafeteria closes at 2pm on weekends. 

3. The nurse came in to talk to my wife about the importance of a few vaccines for her to get so the baby doesn't get sick. As she's leaving, I ask what about me? She responds oh yeah, you probably should too, as if just noticing me for the first time.

335,"I work in a call center helping patients at a hospital order their food. We have other duties, but 90% of my job is just answering phones. There's one shift I occasionally take which is from 3 - 7 p.m. where I just sit in a cubicle and answer phones. I am the only male working in the office with a total of about 20 women, some do what I do, others are registered dietitians. 



Our dress code is business casual, but our environment is also super casual. In my ~7 months of working there, no one has ever mentioned anything about dress code besides my first day when they said it was business casual. 95% of my dress is polos and oxford dress shirts with chinos, except for the last few weeks when I've worn a nice pair of shorts with a short sleeve button down, maybe 3 times to this 4 hour shift. Today I got an email from my supervisor telling me I can't wear shorts anymore. We discussed it and she said she'll bring it up at her manager meeting to see if they'd make an exception for this one shift. No dice there. 

I understand, shorts aren't part of the dress code, I can abide by that. My issue is that the majority of the women in my office regularly violate the dress code in some form or another. Things that are also prohibited are spaghetti straps, tank tops, and athletic shoes. A few of them wear dresses, which are allowed, but there's no length requirement as long as it's not a mini skirt. 

The biggest thing I see, is that if I should be held to the dress code, so should everyone else I work with. Taking that stance however would cause my coworkers to lose some of their comfort while in the office just to prove my point. I'm friends with almost everyone in the office, we all get along and I don't want to cause a divide against myself since this job is in my career field and damaging my reputation could leave me out of letters of rec or even a job opportunity after college. 

What's the difference between women's legs and men's legs? If women can show their legs, why can't I? With all of the equality movements happening around the country, dress codes should be equal.

At what point does a dress become a tank top or spaghetti straps? Some of these dresses show a lot of shoulder, but since it's a dress, does that not count?

I've toyed with the idea of ""reporting"" all of my coworkers dress code violations, which would be anonymous, but not really because everyone would know it was me. I also like my coworkers too much to throw them under the bus just for my sake. 

I've also (not really, though) thought about showing up in a dress, but again that would just cause drama and would not be professional. 

It's annoying to have to wear pants while out and about before my shift or have to stop home to change just to sit in a cubicle for 4 hours.

I'm mostly here to vent, because I don't see anything I can do that would help my cause without hurting my coworkers or my reputation. Anybody else been in a similar situation?

339,"I first posted on this sub a few weeks back, hoping to be able to express my anxiety over a coworker accusing me of rape, and the subsequent workplace investigation. I just got word today that there was insufficient evidence, and I'm cleared!!! 

You guys have been super helpful throughout my ordeal, I just wanted you to know that. And while this may sound to be just common sense stuff, I just wanted to give a quick list of takeaways:

1) Be *extremely* careful if you decide to pursue any kind of relationship with a coworker (folks will say never do it, period, and I sure as shit won't, but it happens), *especially* if it's low-key; publicity actually helps here, since it restricts credibility of ""out-of-nowhere"" claims. In general, employer investigations are waaaay less predictable than criminal ones, and you are *not presumed innocent.* Not to mention, no right to an attorney; lesson learned $5,000 later -__-

2) Never, EVER apologize or express feelings of responsibility in written or audio communications for anything remotely having to do with awkward intimate encounters. I was worried about the girl and tried to bear her apparent regret to help her; she used it against me. Act as if you did nothing wrong and *never admit anything.* It sounds awful, and goes against good sentiment, but it can save your ass.

3) Never delete messages/conversations with partners. Make copies and upload that shit. It can be *SUPER* annoying to recover deleted texts.

4) Don't be alone with drunk chicks who are coming onto you. All she needs to say the next day is, ""I just remember coming to and he was [__]'ing me!"" and your ass is grass.

340,"So talking to my sister she claims there is inequality in football in that there should be mixed men &amp; women teams. 

She uses sports like tennis as an example saying that they sometimes do mix doubles games etc..
Although she understands that there are physiological differences in where on average men have better acceleration, speed, strength, stamina and are taller (all of which is important in football) she believes that there still should be mixed teams available.

She then brings up the argument that the physiological reasons are the same used for men being drafted to war and not women. This is different imo because women are capable of being soldiers and so should have the capability of being drafted despite the physiological differences it should be an obligation that both sex's are drafted or both are not. 

Tbh I'm not too bothered about men &amp; women playing together, but it's an entertainment industry and only the best should be able to be at the top, not some parity thing. 

When stating that women are generally not as good at football otherwise there would be more people attending women games etc...she uses arguments that they're not sponsored, have real day jobs and are not able to train as much... Regardless, teams like Iceland have shown that having a day job and not training as much/ being sponsored can still qualify for the world cup, draw with Argentina (who has arguably one of the best players in the world, with other elite players too). Beat England in the Euro's etc... so that can't be a good enough reason. Surely they're not sponsored because they're not good enough and they're not as entertaining because of that?

Has there been a time where a professional men's team played a women's team, because I feel like it would be necessary for her to see why there is a big difference in ability.

341,"Hi there! I'm a 38 years-old man. Been reading this subreddit for a while. Not an English native speaker, and live on the other side of the world, so admit my grammar errors. I will be short.

As one said earlier, a lot of anger comes out when reading here all is happening to men in the Western world, since decades already. We are losing ground every single day, little by little. 

What I know: men's skills and aptitudes and advantages are put in value in times of distress, when there's need for action, fight, (re)construction, force, active intelligence. That's why **men** built the world we are living in, since hundreds of thousands of years, with all its goods and bads. We shaped the entire environment, discovered things, territories, fought in wars etc. 

Now we are living in peace (again, I speak for the Western world). We are less useful now, most of the things have been constructed, the areas have been shaped for human living, no new territories to discover. Generally speaking of course. So now women come and think (maybe non consciously, but deep inside, on their subconscious level) that they don't need us anymore. No need for protection, to hunt and get the food, to fight in wars. The truth is in peaceful times women can do better all this, in a stable society. We are only useful (still) as procreators. That's why they despise us now and try to diminish our importance. 

I don't say we need a global conflict to re-put men in their rights. But just imagine tomorrow a catastrophic event occurs or something really big hits us. I'm 100&amp;#37; sure all these feminist agressiveness against us and all the subconsideration of men will melt in a second, because they will need us again. Our brains, our superior adaptative skills, our intelligence, our force. And as always, it will be **men** who will save the world. 

Meanwhile, we wait. No heads down, no defensive talks, no guilt feelings. Just quietly wait, because the force (whether they like it or not) is a man characteristic. ",8w0v6z,serbarde,1530702878,12,MensRights,0.09611836,0.028281843,0.010162249

345,"I am finally getting my application for the return of my 3yo son to Greece submitted today in court in Canada.

My ex left me with our son in September for a family ""visit"" to Canada. When she missed her flight back, I asked her to book their return tickets during the following 2 weeks. She kept telling me that she was looking for flights until one night, at almost exactly midnight, I get an email from her lawyer suing for full custody.

I was completely shattered.

Throughout the following week, my mental health deteriorated rapidly due to several other contributing stressors that she orchestrated. I was close to calling it quits for good several times since then, but thankfully I didn't.

After talking to the embassy of Canada here I was informed of the Hague Convention of 1980 for the return of child to their resident country. I filed the application, the Minister of Justice here accepted my application, and they sent the file to the Central Authority in the province she fled to.

When she found out that I made the application, she severed all contact with me and I have only been able to speak to my son once over the past 6 months.

I've gone through 2 lawyers until I was assigned a legal aid rep who, I must admit, was by far the worst of the three. Yesterday, my ex finally replied to one of my weekly email asking her to please allow my son and I to maintain our bond. She called and went on a tirade of ""How can you do this to us? and You are falsely accusing me of kidnapping, and I'll never forgive you, etc...""

I think she's becoming afraid of the court date as the Convention states clearly that unless there is a clear danger to the health/safety of the child that the child should return to it's country of residence.

During our conversation, she kept accusing me of abuse, bullying, assault, isolation, and a bunch of other complete fabrications and I kept listening to her as she went on her tirade. She even said that I put our son at risk of injury when I sat him on a dresser to have an eye-to-eye conversation with him one evening.

I am hopeful that the application will be heard and ruled on within the next few weeks and that I will get to see my son in real life by the end of this summer.

If any of you have any similar situations where your child is taken away from you to another state, know that you have a very strong recourse with this Convention if you live in a country that is part of the Hague convention.

Or you have the movies or shows where a woman pretends to be a man, but she has that woman mentality of, I can say and do whatever I want. And no one just beats her up.

 Think about it, the more ""Nazis"" they punch, the more people who are moderate, will see how stupid it is and move more onto the ""Nazi"" side.

People were brushing up against me constantly, which I didn’t care about because I was too into the music. But then I feel this hand linger on my upper back just far longer than necessary, and then the whole arm drags across my back as this nerdy woman who’s attached to it slips in between me and my wife to head out to the dance floor.

It pissed me off and made it hard to enjoy the music. Later on she sat across from us at a table in another part of the venue. She moved away when it became clear that I wasn’t interested (as well as taken).

It’s obvious that many people have many different opinions but when your opinion isn’t the same you shouldn’t say it’s wrong. Obviously there is the discussion with circumcision. I noticed in a post about such. People who had different ideas about ‘preserving the skin for the kids choice’ were just slandered and downvotes when I agree. I think it’s ridiculous that in a sub I like that if I have one different opinion I get downvoted. I came to this sub to support ideas that aren’t talked about in society.

361,"Hi MRAs!

I'm an ex-feminist. In fact, I think women are second class citizens deserving of the position they had in life for the last 700,000 years. Feminism is toxic to women because it sets us up with false hope that we can achieve what men can. We can't. 

I'm not trans, but I do wish I could get testosterone supplements. I would like to be less emotional, more logical, more interested in things rather than people and relationships, stronger, calmer, and more confident. I do my best to be risk averse with the body chemistry that I have, but it doesn't quite work out the same for me as it does for my husband because of my tendency toward neuroticism. 

I 100&amp;#37; support James Damore and I think he pointed out a lot of things that feminists don't want to admit to themselves - that they ARE in fact, inferior to men. Maleness predicates competence on average because of testosterone - all of the traits that allow men to succeed in a hierarchical society are because of testosterone. Talent and competence and drive let you rise to the top of anything. There's no way a society that feminists envision - one based on relationality, kindness, nurture, never offending anyone, and emotional empathy - would fall apart. That's the reason most societies in the world save for a few small tribes are patriarchal, not matriarchal. 

I'm a biologist, and I'd have to be blind or willfully ignorant not to see these things. It's in the data, and the data does not give two fucks what your feelings are.

Women piss me off so much. You want power? Go after it. Don't just get married, change your last name, have a bunch of babies, and then sit at your computer whining with other feminists about how you don't have enough power in the world. Being a useless baby factory does not contribute to the world at large. Go out and take risks, challenge your fears, FUCKING DO SOMETHING.

Afraid that the truth will come out and you'll be discriminated against? Then do something about that truth, don't expect society to change the narrative to make it easier for you.

To this end, I am on a search for a medical provider to give me low dose testosterone supplements. I honestly believe this is an overlooked treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder, a disorder that by and large affects women, because of the social justice warrior taboo that you can't talk about biological gender differences. A lot of women are suffering at the ends of their own toxic emotionality, as are the men who try to love them, and not getting the help they need to become productive members of society. 

I know I'm personally sick of being this way. I hate it more than I've ever hated anything in my life. 

Ya'll are mad that women won't fuck you? It's because they ARE stuck up bitches who contradict themselves. It's not your fault. You've been fed a lie that masculinity is inherently toxic. Men don't treat me like dirt because I don't go around sexin' myself up with make-up and high heels hoping to use sex appeal to get what my physical strength and intellect can't get me. I dress and act neutral and SURPRISE, men treat me with respect in the workplace. This idea that women in America are oppressed is complete and utter bullshit. We are not oppressed. If you're beautiful, ""beautiful woman privilege"" is stronger than ANY alleged white male heterosexual privilege. I have seen it firsthand from the vantage point of a woman who has passed her prime and was never pretty.

So, hopefully this validates all of what you are thinking. I do hope that testosterone treatment for women becomes a thing someday, and not just for transgendered Male to Female folks, but for all women.

 1) To end domestic violence including against men,  not to whine because someone touched my shoulder or ass without asking first (yes I have experienced both,  some how I managed to survive the experience).

 3. To protect due process
 
 4. To protect freedom of speech

 5. To get more support for men's health

 6. To fight against the demonization of men.

My dad was an ass hole, but I know for sure that not everyone with a penis is evil. I have male friends who are the most practical, intelligent, funny, kind people you could hope to meet. I have female friends who are the same way as them. My problem is that feminists and activists for men, I'm not sure of the word, so excuse me, are just that- they are extremists. I know there are men out there who fight for their own rights because they feel they are being trampled on by man haters around the globe, including fellow men. Masculine feminism is something that I understand the philosophy of, but on a real level, it sounds kind of douchey.

I simply think that instead of being extreme about either side, we all need to stop fighting each other and start fighting the real enemies in life: poverty, misinformation, education failures, and disease, to name a few. If I turn on the news, it's one thing after another. This group is racist, that group hates men, this group hates liberals, that group hates Christians or Jews or Muslims. JUST STOP! It's idiotic.

I’m scared for this world because I could see this coming even as a young boy. Things never made sense to me how, a boy hitting a girl caused outrage and a girl hitting a boy would be seen as comical or not taken seriously at all. Women are not understanding the true happenings behind what they are doing when they trash men. More men care about women than women care about men.

366,"I thought I'd open up a discussion here that doesn't seem to come up that often in other discussions about men's issues. It's a major talking point in women's forums, issues on body image and beauty standards. That often generates plenty of heated rhetoric and there are cases when I think it's justified, but I think that rhetoric is incomplete in how it overlooks how it effects men.

I know those effect because I've experienced them. When I was a teenager, I had some pretty serious body image issues because of a severe acne problem. I know acne is a common issue for teenagers, but mine was SO bad that I had to go on medication for two years to manage it. For a while, I genuinely felt like a freak and it really affected me in ways that caused me great distress.

Later on in life, my acne got better, but my body image was still poor. Thankfully, that was something I could fix without medications. I started going to the gym, working out, and eating better. In time, that helped me gain confidence. It took a lot of work and discipline, though.

That's just my experience. Does anyone else have one they care to share?

370,"I posted this on a thread, but just for the hell of it, I'll give it its own post.   
   
The reason I became interested in the men's rights movement was because I hoped I could find  someone to help me with the situation I'm in. I was convicted of a crime  - technically called stalking, but the Istanbul Convention definition  of stalking is so broad, you wouldn't recognize it as that.

The  actual things I was accused of doing aren't even illegal. It was up to a  team of court psychologists to stitch together a ""pattern of behavior""  and ascribe a dubious motive. More importantly, I have hard proof that I  didn't even do the things I was accused of doing, and separately from that, my accuser was caught in numerous flat-out lies and inconsistencies. When the judge questioned her on it, she yelled at the judge ""I'm not the one on trial here, your honor!"" Normally, you would  think that would be a pretty safe win, right?

So  imagine my surprise when the court ignored ALL of the evidence, and all  of my accuser's blatant lies and inconsistencies. I thought well,  SURELY someone will be offended by this injustice and help me? I've  talked to politicians, every legal aid NGO, journalists, priests,  bishops, a rabbi, community leaders, my parents, about 10 different  lawyers, and they all flashed me a wolfish grin and said ""you're shit  out of luck, buddy."" I talked to the complaints bureau at the ministry of justice (they actually have one!), and they flat out said ""Even if the sentence was handed down illegally, that doesn't mean we can overturn it"". None of them even took the trouble to look at my  evidence, which I have conveniently stashed away on a pen drive. This is NOT a normal situation.

To  make matters even more Orwellian - the government of the country I live in (Poland, if you know someone who is willing and able to help) is trying to curb the dictatorial powers of the court system. Whether they are sincere about this is another matter. I've emailed  some of their politicians about it too, and they didn't even email me  back). The entire liberal, pro-EU faction (most of the people I know,  since I live in a big city) are busy protesting in the streeta in favor of ""judges' rights"" and the ""defense of the tripartate separation of powers"". Even the church made a statement this week, saying they support ""judicial independence"".  There IS no separation of powers! The courts do whatever the fuck they  want. My dad, a big supporter of the EU liberal party, was at my court  trial, but now he's posting on facebook every day about the poor, poor  judges being forced to justify the sentences they hand down.

There are no billionaires in the senate, but we obviously acknowledge that is irrelevant given their lobbying power.

The relevant question to evaluating which gender has more political authority isn't the politicians, but the lobbies, so;

How many organizations are there that lobby on behalf of womens collective interests?

How many organizations are there that lobby on behalf of mens collective interests?

In terms of lobbying power and money, how much is put towards advancing the interests of that group?

This is extremely obvious to everyone when it comes to the rich, to the point it would be laughable for someone to earnestly assert they are underrepresented in politics and their interests consequently aren't being served, but feminists use the same argument all the time despite similar monopolization of lobbying for their interests that the rich engage in.

The feminist conception of political power being mostly male is superficial. It is superficial because they are not sincerely evaluating society, but are only looking for evidence to validate their own prejudices about how it works.

375,"Hey men and women of men's rights, 

I am writing as a new manager, and a woman. 

I am so thankful that our company supports parental leave equally for both men and women. 

More and more men at our company are taking advantage of this and taking time to bond with their children. This makes me so happy, as this is not just great for men and amazing for their children to get time to bond with their fathers, but this is amazingly helpful for feminism and equal pay and treatment in the workplace - for both men and women.

One of the last big barriers for women is the stigma we feel in professional environments when it comes to family planning, and, unfortunately, the wage gap between us and our male counterparts in the workplace. 

With more and more men taking parental leave, the anxiety women might feel around taking maternity leave is lessened, because our male co-workers are taking time to be with their children too, and some of them are deciding to stay home and be a parent while their wives continue their careers. 

This is a true change in what I've come to know of the professional environment growing up and working for the past 20 years. 

Part of why I think women might make less over the course of their careers is because they will work less (or are perceived to) and are more likely to leave the workforce to care for their families. Additionally, I think women might have pursued careers with lower ceilings because of some of this assumed family responsibility. Now, women seem to be taking on higher roles and responsibilities, because men and women are both caring for their families and both thinking of their careers in the same way. 

This is a huge step towards equality in the workplace and I just want to thank all the men that take the time to go and bond with their children, that support their wive's careers, and to all of the organizations that make parental leave an equal benefit to both men and women.

381,"A few days ago, I was in a discussion with a rabid feminist about false rape accusations.

I just don't think believing people as a matter of principle makes much sense.

383,"There seems to be a new awakening regarding sexual harassment in Canada. 

Is it fair to ask a question? 

**What are the rules regarding sexual harassment in the workplace, or in our everyday lives in Canada, in 2018?**

This is a question posed by Dr. Jordan Peterson, which was misframed and vilified a few months ago.

Nevertheless, the question is a valid one.

On one hand, we might say, ""we should never make unwanted sexual advances."" And that seems fine. That seems logical enough.

But how can we know what constitutes an unwanted sexual advance if we are not the person experiencing it? 

According to our own Prime Minister, ""people, in many cases women, experience interactions in a professional context and other contexts differently than men.""

This is obviously true. And this is part of the problem. Being that everything is relative, how can a person know if their behaviour is being evaluated as being sexual in nature or not?

For example, if a male comments that a female colleague, ""looks beautiful in that dress,"" does that constitute a violation? 

How can we know that in advance?

Further complicating the issue, men and women express sexuality in different ways. 

Male sexuality is much more overt. Often a male will express his sexual desire in a straightforward manner. This has led many men into problems, and maybe rightfully so.

Females express their sexuality in a different manner. Generally their sexuality will be expressed in the clothing they wear, or in their perfume, or in subtle looks or hints enticing a potential male partner.

This is where it gets more complicated. 

Could these subtle expressions be misconstrued as ""unwanted sexual advances""? 

What if a female wants sexual attention. Should she not be able to ""ask"" for this type of attention if wanted?

In that case, if a female does suggest sexuality to a male colleague, does this allow the male colleague to respond in kind?

Is it possible that a female's expression of sexuality could be misconstrued as an opening for a male to be allowed to initiate a sexual advance?

Sometimes these signals aren't clear or are ambiguous. What if they are misinterpreted by the male?

So.  **What are the rules?**

One man has lost his job because he was a ""close talker"". Another man apparently touched a female reporter inappropriately, but seems politically untouched by it.

Why were the standards different for two different people?

Why hasn't any attempt been made to clear up this ambiguity?

Are those rules different for men and women?

Can I say, ""you look beautiful?"" Can she brush me on the arm as she walks by? Can I look at a woman from across the room? Can she put herself in my line of vision hoping to attract my gaze?

Why are we pretending like sexuality isn't a part of our everyday lives?

The overall point is we seem to be in the midst of a new paradigm shift. A new awakening if you will.

I understand from society females aren't interested in unwanted sexual advances. And that's completely fair. But can that be more properly defined? 

Is it possible to make a list of rules so it is more clear for everyone?

I'm sure there are a great number of people out there who were accused who didn't realize their sexual advances were unwanted.

391,"I wish I could say I was shocked to learn this, but I recently found out that the new US tax policy eliminates the alimony deduction for couples who get divorced in January 2019 or beyond.  It is reported that wealthy politicians who are planning divorce are scrambling to finalize their own divorces before the end of the year to avoid having this policy applied to themselves.

Up until now, the policy had been that a person ordered to pay alimony could deduct the alimony from their own taxable income and the payee would then pay tax on it.  This is very advantageous compared to the new policy because it generally allows money to be taxed at a lower marginal rate.

For instance, if Bob's income is $100,000 and Sue's income is $30,000 and the two of them divorce today, suppose that the courts order Bob to pay $20,000 in alimony each year for the next five years.

Under the current tax policy, Bob will pay taxes on $80,000 (100K - 20K) and Sue would pay tax on $50,000 (30K + 20K), thus making those alimony dollars taxed at a lower rate for all but the wealthiest taxpayers than if Bob payed taxes on the entire $100,000.

Under the new policy, Bob would pay taxes on the entire $100,000, thus having the money taxed at a higher rate.

In addition to the problem that the divorced couple now has less money left between them after taxes, an additional problem remains that if individual states don't update their policies in response to this, then the entire tax burden will be payed by the higher earning spouse, thus shifting the entire burden onto them.

Given that the great majority of alimony payors are men, it sounds to me like this is a very regressive tax on divorced men.  I don't think that President Trump's voters wanted this when they elected him to office!",8yo77q,Evergreen2718,1531519190,9,MensRights,0.028856417,0.017485369,0.006530962
392,"This is the story about how I was falsely accused for rape. This happened last year and thankfully it never made it into any legal system.

So I was apart of an acting group in October of 2017.  We were performing our last weekend performance of our musical, Heathers, and on Saturday night we all decided to get together to hang out. It wasn’t the full cast though, just about 15 people.  I knew the people there but felt uncomfortable with them because I wasn’t that close with any of them, except for my friend named Drake (name changed).

We got close that night playing tons of ping pong, making funny snapchat filter videos, and the like.  His ride to the party was his friend Miranda (name changed again).  And I guess before the party she was acting especially rude to him for no apparent reason.  

Towards the end of the party, she told Drake she was heading out and to come grab his stuff. And me, feeling uncomfortable there with the others and being in a culture where walking with friends to their car was normal, walked out with them.  It was pitch-black outside and so Drake asked me to search the car because he couldn’t find something small, like his phone charger or something.  So I hopped in the back and threw on my phone’s flashlight and helped him find it.  

I find it in the backseat and say, “Hey Drake here it is”. And so we step out of the car at the exact same time Miranda opens the door, with her friend Ashley (name changed) was out there.  So we politely said thanks and all that, and watched Miranda drive off to make sure she was safe.

Now flashforward to the next day.

My ride to the performance sends me a text saying ‘hey, can’t take you.’ And so I was confused but respectfully said, “that’s okay, can you give me a ride back home?” And she says “no.”  So then that was odd.

I get to the performance and things are tense and hell. I walked in and got dirty looks from everyone except Drake, my best friend at the time Bella (just assume all names are changed), and a few other of my guy friends.  She pulls me over to the side and tells me how Miranda is going around accusing me and Drake of raping her.

This took me aback by far. I’m the type of person who respects women fully. I open doors, always ask for consent, and always takes no for an answer.  I don’t make any inappropriate jokes or reference anything, so it shocked me to even get why I was being accused of this.

But anyway, Bella filled me in on ‘everything’.  Apparently I grabbed Miranda’s butt on our way out, Drake and I kept making sexual jokes about her body, and when we entered her car we locked the door.  Then, she proceeds to tell me how Ashley opened the car door, screamed ‘get out!’ In a demonic hell-demon voice, and how both drake and I jumped out and ran into the house scared.

Then this girl Lynn (who was the host), reinforced their story by saying that they had cameras outside and could prove this. (But refused to offer this evidence when asked later)

By this time I was absolutely livid because nobody besides Bella told me the truth, and I told her my side and said that my story made more sense.

So for that entire day I was practically tormented inside my own head.  Nobody would speak to me except the guys, and the entire atmosphere was toxic.   At the end of the show, however, this is what pissed me off the most.  Our show director, Colin (who is gay), comes up to us and says ‘hey drake and ___ can you guys help me lift this?’  This first was sketchy because I’m kinda scrawny and wouldn’t be able to lift anything, and even when my other friend Jordan (who is a bodybuilder) offered to help he was shut down.  So we follow Colin and he fills us in on what’s going on. How this Rumor is going on and he wants our side of the story. So we tell him exactly what happened and how nothing sexual happened, and every question Colin asked felt like he didn’t believe our story and was looking for chinks in our story.  We stay respectful during the entire process, making sure not to anger anyone else.

So about 15 minutes later, Colin calls Miranda up to discuss this and make her feel comfortable. Key word-her.  He has her explain her side of the story, and even when we both try and explain our sides and how they obviously contradict. But none of them were having it. She only got to tell her point of view of the story and how we hurt her. But the killer part of all of his is that she explicitly said that she never used the word ‘rape’

We all are dismissed from talking and we go back downstairs, and all the girls go and gossip about it in the other room while Drake and I are just utterly defeated by how unfair everything was.  Then Greyson, whos cool with both guys and girls, shows us a group chat that Miranda made and added the entire cast to except for Drake and myself.  Basically saying how we raped her and when we got called out we ‘ran away like a deer in headlights’. In the group chat, I read how she explicitly uses the word rape.  Contradicting what she told Colin earlier.

The next few weeks I was absolutely crushed. I was beyond depressed, I was bombing tests, and I was close to losing all my friends.  The only person who showed me that I did nothing wrong was my now-girlfriend who has always supported me.

This experience really woke me up to the awful reality we live in. Women can use their words to harm men or anyone who stand in their way.  In my case, I lost all my friends and I lost out on an amazing experience.  The concept of sex is basically ruined for me because every time I try having sex I get horribly flashbacks to the feelings I had those weeks.

I will support some feminists who truly believe in equality among genders, but I can and will not support feminism when it takes away the rights of men and others. 

This is the first time I have publicly shared my story with anyone, so I would like to thank whoever took the time to read all of this.  I pray that our society can change to fix all of these horrible problems. ",8yoy86,DabKam,1531525481,26,MensRights,0.23343207,0.062150877,0.043955702

A sloppy slandering claiming that a fast-mouthed and crass politician is guilty of misogyny while one of his rivals is a quaint little angel who thinks well of men.

A hit against a different, very well-mannered fellow for becoming a real representative of men's rights in Australia, where it is indeed needed.

A well-designed site called E-Flux having a hard time understanding that France has its own defined standards of courting and expressing sexuality and they are rife with boldness, coming from both men and women, not seeing how MeToo provides a hard smother against the more wild and cherished amorous culture the country has enjoyed. Some good points were made, but France and some of its subtleties and raucousness seems to remain alien to them.

A Metro news piece about how a politician was fined for protesting against male genital mutilation (circumcision, polite shorthand). Disgustingly little empathy was shown, his quotes were used but he was ignored and instead he was ridiculed as a minor public nuisance. What we can learn is that protesting in small groups leads to a brushing aside, protesting in large groups can lead to either success or a smear as rioting.

A piece sympathizing with a woman who after reporting a rape admitted she lied, and subsequently saw jail time. Exactly what Henry Cavill is worried about, not even two days after he came under fire for saying why he's worried.

And I just beamed with pride at how I know for a fact she picked these things up directly from me. She was raised by my father and his second wife, but again for some reason she picked me as a role model to emulate.

Point being, the habits she picked up from me, I strongly believe, have led her to being a great wife and mother. She has no sense of hyper entitlement and is very amenable to negotiation when a disagreement arises. She's no pushover, I just taught her to pick her fights rather than blithely act like a cunt all the time.

Point being; If you notice, this is exactly the opposite of what women believe. Of how they straight up believe men have no value, no rights, no reason to be treated with any sort of consideration.

My little sister works part time and is very happy with her life. She is very satisfied, very fulfilled. 

The vast majority of SJW/feminist types, horrendously mistreat men and do not respect even the most basic rights of men. Although they generally get what they want, these types of women lead long, miserable, unfulfilled lives and a greater percentage of women reports unhappiness every decade , or at least this has been a steady trend since the 50s ish?

**Conclusion** :

Could it be that feminism itself is ""toxic"" to women and especially to little girls being taught by their mother? I'm starting to think so.

I think, and bare with me here I am speculating but, I think that believing in, and respecting the rights of men, as if they were valuable parts of the family unit, makes women happier than women's mirage offer of ""YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL"".",8z45oi,TheMythof_Feminism,1531681905,11,MensRights,0.17025198,0.05262003,0.009566744

406,"Pasted and copied from /r/LegalAdvice without the link included so there is no hint of brigading.

&gt;I (15f) think I was raped by my ex boyfriend. 

&gt;Today is my 15th birthday but all of this occurred while I was still 14. I dated my ex boyfriend (also 14 at the time) for around 6 months, until about a month ago when I broke up with him. Throughout the relationship he did many things to me that I knew were wrong, but I didn’t recognize the full extent until recently.

&gt;On one occasion we were having consensual sex with a condom. And I realized that he had removed the condom without my permission. From what I know, this is called “stealthing” and is considered sexual assault.

&gt;After I got on birth control I agreed to have sex without a condom, under the agreement that he would not come inside me. He did regardless of our agreement and on multiple occasions. He even admitted to doing it on purpose.

&gt;The final occurrence was the most recent. I had entirely evoked consent to intercourse because of the things he had done to me in the past. But I still consented to oral. We were having oral sex when he forcibly began to engage in intercourse with me. I responded by pushing him off of me and that was the end of it.

&gt;Throughout our relationship he would constantly pressure me and touch me despite my refusal.

&gt;A few things to note: -I have no evidence of any of these things occurring but I could easily get him to admit to what he did -He is a heavy marijuana user and may have been high during some of these events -He and I are both diagnosed with depression and anxiety so it’s possible that he would claim mental illness, but I can assure you, he knew exactly what he was going

&gt;I am fearful of pursuing legal action because I am afraid that I will not be taken seriously. I’m also not sure that I could handle the mental and emotional hardships of going to trail. Finally, I have not told my parents or therapist about what happened. In all honestly I am very ashamed and afraid of judgement from others as a result of making this public. I just don’t know what to do and I feel so alone. Thank you to anyone who reads this &lt;3

Hmm.  So beginning with:

&gt;On one occasion we were having consensual sex with a condom. And I realized that he had removed the condom without my permission. From what I know, this is called “stealthing” and is considered sexual assault.

Considered sexual assault in exactly one case exactly one time in Canada.  Not anywhere else.  Also, it is pretty damn hard not to notice whether or not a guy is wearing a condom.  (Yeah, I am female.  Believe me, you can tell.)  Also, those things tend to fall off sometimes due to no one's fault.  Not that I ever had sex with a 14 year old, but I think we can safely assume inexperience might have had something to do with it.  But no, let's just call that sexual assault and try to ruin his life for victim points.  /s/


&gt;After I got on birth control I agreed to have sex without a condom, under the agreement that he would not come inside me. He did regardless of our agreement and on multiple occasions. He even admitted to doing it on purpose.

So like a 14 year old did not have perfect control on when he comes?  Well now, who could have expected that?  Lock him up and throw away the key.  /sarcasm  Also I think that last sentence there was just thrown in for BS, look at me I have to be the victim here, reasons.

&gt;The final occurrence was the most recent. I had entirely evoked consent to intercourse because of the things he had done to me in the past. But I still consented to oral.

Because what, you are a damned idiot?  Go ahead, walk me through this thought process.  

&gt;We were having oral sex when he forcibly began to engage in intercourse with me. I responded by pushing him off of me and that was the end of it.

Yeah, big damn fucking surprise here.  When you show up naked in some guy's bed and start sucking his cock he tends to think that you are up for sex.  Especially when you have had sex with him multiple times before.  Especially if he is 14 and you are giving him mixed messages.  Don't want to have sex?  Keep your clothes on.  How hard is that?

&gt;Throughout our relationship he would constantly pressure me and touch me despite my refusal.

So why exactly was it that your relationship continued?  Why exactly is it that you decided to only complain about this after you broke up?

&gt;He and I are both diagnosed with depression and anxiety so it’s possible that he would claim mental illness, but I can assure you, he knew exactly what he was doing.

So you also did know what you were doing, right?  Or do you intend to claim that your identical mental illness prevented you from free will but of course his did not and he is totally responsible?  Of course you intend to claim that.  It is the victim's bible.  Here's a thought.  Get your own shit in order before venturing into relationships.  Especially with the likewise wounded.  That would require some degree of self responsibility which is sadly lacking in many areas of reddit.

&gt;I am fearful of pursuing legal action because I am afraid that I will not be taken seriously.

Well yes, actually, it is quite hard to take you seriously since you kept fucking him and sucking his cock voluntarily again and again.  Since you had no problems with him until long after you broke up.  Since he was 14 damn years old already...   But sure, reddit will rally round and assure you that of course you were the victim here and you should press criminal charges and do everything possible to destroy his life.  I am just damn grateful that we don't pick juries off reddit.

407,"Brought to you by the man who wrote ""Gold Digger"", another men's issues mention in the new song ""Yikes"". When Russell Simmons, a producer for Kanye, said he was ""unraveling in public"", referencing Kanye's mental condition and how it is heard in his new album, Kanye did lend some support back to Russell on track. Russell was recently accused of rape by three women, and as with most old-made-new cases, it must be taken with a grain of salt. Russell admits he had been sexually aggressive, but had received pleasurable consent from all his ""victims"". In any case, MeToo's empowerment of female victims once again has been hijacked and abused to assail a man's behavior as a crime rather than targeting actual crimes. Regardless, Russell has been apologetic and agrees that his behavior was wrong but he is no rapist, he's been shamed for being openly sexual with people who had never shown sign of disapproval at the time, and may have never truly been offended. So, another man of sexual virility and openness, Kanye, worries that one of his female friends from the past might be equally opportunistic and use this moment to demonize male sexuality for personal gain.

""Russell Simmons wanna pray for me too
I'ma pray for him 'cause he got #MeToo'd

418,"I wanted to hear from the sub about their thoughts on gender roles in society, their present state and value or harm, and generally establish a counterargument to the feminist narrative. To my understanding, this is what each side believes:

Feminism: gender roles were created by men to subjugate women, and have since been integrated into society to become a set of social norms that harm both sexes. Gender roles are entirely social constructs that do not reflect any difference between the genders and oppress those who do not conform to their rigid rules, especially women. Gender roles are partly or wholly responsible for phenomenons such as toxic masculinity and transphobia.

Men's Rights: gender roles were originally a byproduct of significant biological and psychological differences between men and women. For ancient societies, these gender roles were frequently the most efficient use of people, and were not created to oppress women. Gender roles today, while harming some that don't conform, merely reflect those same biological differences between sexes.

Feel free to correct me on either stance. I'm especially unsure of where the MR community stands specifically on the issue, as I don't think it has been clearly stated, but I took what I knew and tried to extrapolate.

I’m trying to avoid specific instances of crazy accusations, people with criminal records, an ex who had police threaten you, taking the kids across country etc.

For me, Texas has standard and expanded visitation that can be elected. These are defaults in pretty much all cases. I elected expanded, I have my kids the 1st, 3rd, and 5th (when applicable) weekend of each month and every Thursday overnight. On my off weeks, I pick my kids up from school on Thursday and drop them off at school on Friday morning. On my weekends, it goes from Thursday pickup to Monday morning drop off at school. I get the weekends in the summer minus Thursdays, plus the entire month of July. Overall, I see my kids about 41% of the year.

The minus is that child support is calculated using a simple equation that does not take into account how much time I spend with kids and how much each parent makes.

424,"When a lot of guys first get started in the field of self-development, they go through this sort of “fake phase.” What I mean by this, is that they’ve read about alpha males and beta males, and they’ve realized that they act like a beta male.

So to become more “alpha,” they change their behaviors. They spend all of this time fretting over questions like:

“Uhh, should I do this for a girl? Is it too beta?”

“Uhh what should I wear? What does an alpha male wear?’

“How long should I wait to call her back?”

“When does an alpha male break eye contact?”

But what they don’t realize is that you can change every single one of your behaviors…and it still won’t change whether you’re an alpha or beta male.

Whether you’re an alpha male or beta male is determined by your mindset. This is my gripe with most of modern masculine self-development. It trains men to attack the surface level problems, and not the underlying causes.

So instead of trying to change every single one of your little behaviors, just change your underlying mindset so that the behaviors will change themselves naturally.

An Example to Clarify: A Woman’s Perspective

If you’re reading my blog, then you should be out building your social circle on the regular. This is one of the most important habits for men to have, and it will change your life in ways you can’t even imagine.

If you’ve been going out to various night clubs, bars, and other social venues, then I guarantee there’s something that you’ve seen a large number of times.

Ugly, fat girls who try to hide their unattractiveness with flashy jewelry, loads of makeup, and silk dresses.

Not to be a dick, but I’m just telling it how it is. Do you find those girls attractive? Of course not. You can see through their fake exterior. You can tell they’re just covering up their underlying unattractiveness with a bunch of external bullshit.

Oh, wait…

Yeah, that’s right. That’s exactly what girls think when they see a beta male who tries to “act alpha.” They can smell through it in a minute, because they’re extremely intuitive. They can tell when a man is just acting confident, but doesn’t actually have true confidence.

You guys have a bunch of articles and bullshit misleading you, telling you that you can “Become an Alpha Male by Following These 4 Behaviors!”—and it pisses me off, because I was in the same boat as you a while back.

Don’t get misled by bullshit marketing and hype—if you want to become an alpha male, you have to do more than just cover up beta male behaviors.

You have to shift your mindset. You have to think about things like an alpha male would, and you have to feel the same way that an alpha male would. You need to completely transform who you are.",90atk4,JadedEffort,1532042473,3,MensRights,0.18459146,0.07967083,0.008155655

426,"As we know, suicide, and I'm talking about people that actually kill themselves, so I am statistically referring to men as the primary, is something that occurs with disturbing regularity.

It is my understanding that suicide is the result of a man's suffering and pain exceeding the threshold for that man's method of coping with suffering and pain. In other words, it simply becomes too much to bare and the man decides to check out, or so that is I have consistently read.

I've had some very dark times in my life where suicide was definitely on my mind and in some instances, I had begun to plan it out. This by the way, marks a huge difference in terms of analysis. Once someone begins to plan it out, that's when they are isolated / committed for their own security.

In my case, it wasn't one big event, it was a series of small events that kept cropping up, loss of friends and family, work trouble, general dissatisfaction but above all else, and here is my core premise **I felt I had no future** , it felt like there was nothing to look forward to, that nothing would change.

I believe that is a key aspect that must be observed. Men at large, currently suffer greatly with no sign of relief in sight. Unlike women, we do not have government and the citizenry at large protecting us regularly.  We stand alone and this is by design.

It is not the same for women who have built-in support networks, government programs specifically aimed at them for this and the citizenry at large looking out for them on a regular basis. They are never alone.

This distinction I believe, is what may lead a man to believe that things will just stay the same or get worse whereas it does not appear to be the same for women.

Of course, traumatic events like divorce, having his children torn away from him, etc. are all  red flags that should put us on high alert, to be concerned for that man's life. 

I believe the lack of a future is central, is this something that should be curtailed by law through a right that could ensure men at least SOME aid  in some instances?

429,"We had a post here the other day about the RAINN AMA in which comments from men, who said when they genuinely needed help RAINN wouldn't help them, were ignored by the RAINN AMA OP. I thought it was interesting though that so many of the responses from other people claiming to have worked for RAINN (or organizations like it) mentioned that they are on guard when men call because most of the men they've had call were either prank, lewd, or an attempt to find out where their victim is.

I'm not at ALL suggesting that men shouldn't be able to use these crises services. But I think it's worth thinking about or discussing that RAINN employees seem to have the experience that most men who call are calling for nefarious reasons. I would think this would be a huge barrier to overcome for men getting help, if people on the front lines of RAINN or other services are suspicious of men calling due to experience.

Why do you think that it is that people in the call centers seem to have gotten this impression about men who call, and can anything be done about it?

430,"First of all, I'm a dumbass for taking a women's word that I barely knew about being on birth control at face value. I was drunk and should've known better. I understand. It is extremely likely that I am the father (I came inside her twice). Plan B pill was ineffective based on ovulation day (I watched her take it and swallow it). Pushed for abortion but she's not going to do it. She's about 1 month pregnant so far. I am 100% willing to leave the country, but I've been researching the feasibility of this and passport revocation seems to be a major stumbling block. I've spent a lot of time thinking and researching this so I'll explain my train of thought below. I will ultimately accept the consequences of my stupidity, but I want to exhaust any options to avoid this if I can. In researching the realities of child support, I just don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. I see countless stories of men being financially raped, considering suicide, and suffering.

I'm 27 years old, just paid off my student loans (for a worthless degree), but haven't really made much more than $16/hr. This is why I'm worried. I won't have money for lawyers to get adequately represented in court, I won't be able to go back to school. and I'll be resigned to 19 years of destitution. Maybe its not as horrible as I'm making it out to be in my mind, but so far, anecdotal evidence points that way.

\-If I leave the country before any paternity affadavit is issued (if at all), I'm pretty sure I can still be served through my parents or some alternative service (I'll probably ask a lawyer about this). We're both residents of the state and this may be sufficient for the court to exercise personal jurisdiction over me regardless of my absence. There are no long-arm statutes in my state that specifically reference child support or paternity. My hope is that by going to a country where there is no Hauge convention on service of process, the process would be costly, difficult, and she may not be able to. The target countries I would go to have no conventions on service of process.

\-If she serves me successfully while out of the country, its possible that through several proceedings a default judgement is arrived at. Once that is entered, and the arrears hit $2,500 my passport can be denied or revoked. I have not read anywhere explicitly that the government can revoke your passport while you're overseas, but that it can only deny an application for a new passport or for a renewal. I've talked to a few lawyers, the passport office, and nobody has a definitive answer on the scope the State Department's use of this privilege. I know they did it to Snowden but that's obviously an exceptional case.

\-If she can't serve me then I just stay out of the country for as long as I possibly can. The motivation and drive would be sufficient that I keep myself in compliance with the country's laws, visas, etc. I would also seek permanent residency and naturalization of citizenship through the country.

\-For the purposes of changing my name on my passport, I would still have the same social security number. This name change would be in public court records.

\-If I wanted to gain citizenship and a second passport in say, Paraguay, it may become apparent during the naturalization process that I owe child support or that my passport was revoked. Its hard to know for sure because there's little information on these matters.

If anyone has in-depth information about these circumstances, please let me know. Like I said, I will eventually acquiesce to the consequences of my stupidity, but I have one life to live and I want to enjoy it as much as possible. I can try to talk to a lawyer, but I doubt they'll be receptive to helping me evade child support. I simply value my freedom.

437,"I was talking to my younger sister, whom greatly takes after me for some reason, and we were having a good laugh about how a lot of people don't believe me when I say she's the closest thing to a female version of me that will ever exist. To the point where some people online don't think she ""exists"" as I say because it's impossible. She obviously finds it absurd.

Anyway, she's in her early 20s and has a 3 year old son. She's married. But she started to ask me (For some reason she has always looked at me as some sort of role model and mentor [flattering but WTF?])  how she could raise her child, train him if you will, to avoid all of these problems that modern men face .... ""How do I teach him to avoid false rape accusations? how do I teach him to protect himself from women that will abuse or exploit him? how do I teach him that marriage is not worth it for men?""

At which point I beamed with pride and said ""You are now officially a female anti-feminist/MRA"" and she looked at me quizzically..... I explained that there is no real preparation for this, the best she can do is give him the choice to learn what the world is really like but he has to choose to accept reality, or in simple terms ""choose to take the red pill"".

* That being, he has no rights protecting him from false rape accusations.
* He has no rights protecting him from a marriage that ends badly, or even being forced into marriage by proxy (Ex: pregnant woman)
* He has no right to defend himself physically if a woman assaults him.
* Etc.

She looked aghast and told me that that's bullshit. That men SHOULD have rights, which again caused me to beam with pride at the monster I had created.

But then it struck me as similar to Karen Straughan having sons..... if she had only daughters, would she still be ""The Karen"" like Picard was ""The Picard""?  are women only able to ""empathize"" with men by using their sons as a proxy?

Feminists can go too far, but it seems to me that in so many men's rights discussions (eg: comments under youtube videos) men go too far in the other direction.

I am not a feminist. But when I watch TV and I see the women's March and women wearing those stupid hats, I wonder what the hell they are complaining about. Before my husband I have been in a few different relationships. I have worked with men at my job. I grew up around male family members. I cannot think of one time in my entire life that I felt victimized because I am a woman. I do not feel like I have been treated differently in any way. and it really pisses me the fuck off when I see these women on TV marching and yelling and acting like complete idiots because it makes everyone else look bad. And you know what? I like the fact that my husband is stronger than me. I like the fact that he takes home the bacon while I care for the house and the children. I love how masculine he is.  And I feel like that's the way it should be. He respects me and I respect him. Yes I agree there are some things that I can do myself without issue. But he doesn't always let me, and it's not because he disrespects me...

Physically I did it with a little bit of struggle but it wasn't too bad. He told me next time to ask him to do it. the only reason he did that is cuz he cares about me and he doesn't want me to get hurt. One of those crazy ass feminist would have gotten upset if a guy would have treated them like that.  And I really do not feel that women are paid less.

444,"**TL:DR** Through the course of my own life I have experienced and encountered too many things that just do not support the idea of ""Male Privilege"" for it to make any sense.   


I have a fraternal twin sister which has been a great joy of my life. We went through a lot of things together, both good and bad. There were times where I have felt a closeness to her that no other person could match. Yet, there were times also where our circumstances contrasted so much that it hurt. 

My mother was encouraging to both of us, but was very paranoid about who my sister dated and where she was. This was not the case with me, at least, not as much. I often stood in defense of my sister and her autonomy, encouraging her to do her own thing as I believed her to be very responsible - which she was. In that way, I could see where someone would see me having some kind of ""privilege."" Yet, that's not the whole story. 

My father treated my sisters with kid gloves. Sure, he might have yelled at them once in a while, but generally he believed in a code of chivalry when it came to the treatment of women. My brother and I, that was not the case. There are many times I do not wish to remember, but I do recall being pinned to the ground by my head, after getting in a fight with a girl at school (who had clawed me in the eyes after I refused to move from my bus seat in kindergarten.) my father growled ""you hit another girl, hell, if you fight in school ever again, I'll make you regret the day you did"", I regretted it that day for sure. It was that day that I learned that society expected me to get hit by girls and never hit back. 

For five years afterwards I lived under that Kafkaesque treatment. I didn't dare fight in school, and my classmates picked up on that. So I was beaten at school as well, with lunch trays, chunks of ice, wooden hall passes, books, lit fire crackers were stuffed into my backpack, juice boxes were dumped over my papers, etc. When the urge to defend myself welled up, I just cried instead - I had no power. When my sister cried it was treated with incredible seriousness, when I cried I was told ""the world is unfair"" by teachers, principals, and my parents. It was that day that I learned that emotions did nothing to help the situation of boys. 

My parents divorced, and the day my father left, I kicked the crap out of the first kid that tried to hurt me. My sister never had to do such things to prove that she didn't deserve such terrible treatment. It was then I learned that boys had to fight for survival in the social pecking order. 

Years passed and we turned 18. My sister and I both celebrated by buying cigarettes and lotto tickets. We registered to vote and went to an 18+ club. It was all well and good until I got a little piece of card stock in the mail that said ""Selective Service."" Not understanding, my sister asked if she was going to have to get one too. My mother said no. I asked if I had to send it in, and she said ""If you want to go to college, and get student loans, then yes."" My sister, perhaps not being very observant of my own dismay muttered ""thank god."" It was that day that I learned that men were granted their rights as a matter of condition - their willingness to submit to the chance of war. 

At one point, during one of the fights my sister and I had (I was about 18ish), she had stolen money from my dresser to use with her friends. I, naturally, was pretty pissed and began yelling at her. Sensing that she had no leg to stand on, my sister attempted to end the conversation by opening the nearest window and screaming ""Rape"" at the top of her lungs. When I immediately froze and signaled her to stop, she grinned and kept going. I slammed the window shut, and she ran away giggling. My mother, thankfully, informed my sister that such accusations could not be made lightly, and if a neighbor had heard that and called the police it would have ruined my life. She never did it again, mostly because my mother somehow conveyed to her that it hurt the case of actual rape victims and furthermore was something beyond despicable to do to an innocent person. It was that day that I learned that women could, with one word, destroy my life. 

My father has since atoned for his actions, and we talked it out when I was much older. I knew he was only passing on what he had learned from his own father, but he deeply regretted doing it. I began building strong relationships with my family. 

It was then that decided to learn about my grandfather (my mother's father). He had died in 1974 of a sudden stroke, before I was born. He was held up as the ideal man from the time I was little. How, I asked, could I be like him? What made him great?

Yet, as I dug, the real pain began. 

He had served in the Army in World War II, fighting in France, Belgium and Germany. He had told people very little about his experience of war, only that yes he had killed and he didn't know how to process that. After doing substantial research I was able to find out where he went, down the the company level. He was up for the draft, but enlisted to ensure his position in an Armored Division.

At the Battle of the Bulge he was in the city of St. Vith where some of the hardest fighting occurred. His entire division was surrounded by the Germans, and he narrowly escaped with his life. This was not the case for the entire rifle company of men that died in a single day's fighting in that town. Among them were over 20 members of his company including a 17 year old. Men who were pictured with him in France were among the dead. 

I asked my mother to come clean. How had the war affected him? The reality came out. He had horrendous PTSD which he tried to drown out with alcohol. Most nights he couldn't sleep unless there was thunder, as the sound of distant guns was comforting to him, reminding him of times away from the front. He had done everything to control his behavior, but he would at times waver between abusing his kids and bawling his eyes out. Despite hating guns, and hating war, he never left the house without a loaded pistol. My mother had learned a respect for men from him. He had gone through something truly awful, incomprehensible, and was expected to return home as if nothing had happened. The times he snapped my mother said, he was not himself, but a soldier in war, caught in a struggle of life and death - every day. 

While it is true that women had their own struggles in that time, I just can't reconcile the idea of ""male privilege"" with the pictures of thousands of dead men on the battlefields I researched. The cost of being a man, which came with no certainty of power as the word ""privilege"" would imply, just should not be ignored for the sake of arguing one's own misfortunes.

445,"&gt;It's not enough that men are already having more orgasms than women. To make matters worse, a new study published in the Journal of Sex Research found — aside from deriving pleasure from their own orgasms, obviously — men also derive a specific sort of masculine pleasure from making female partners orgasm. The researchers in the study, Sara Chadwick and Sari van Anders, refer to this incredibly predictable phenomenon as a ""masculinity achievement."" I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I imagine a ""masculinity achievement"" looks something like Super Mario punching a coin out of one of those floating boxes in the video game.

&gt;""Despite increasing focus on women's orgasms, research indicated that the increased attention to women's orgasms may also serve men's sexuality, complicating conceptualizations of women's orgasms as women-centric,"" researchers wrote.

[Before you say, yeah but it's Cosmo, note that the author is merely repeating the arguments of the feminist ""researchers"" who conducted the ""study""]

So we're now at the point where feminists are literally complaining about *pleasure*.   Please, please tell me this is peak feminism.   I mean, surely it can't get more insane than this?  Can it?   It can't right?   Right?   

Honestly I think the conclusions drawn from this study are more profound than they at first appear.   Good sex is men and women in symbiosis, coming together for mutual benefit and ecstasy.   Yet because the act gives men pleasure and indeed, confidence, it is highly ""problematic"" from the feminist's POV.   Men must not be allowed to feel good -- and certainly not about themselves -- at any time or in any situation.   They must be humiliated, degraded, and made miserable, even if this makes women miserable in the process.   ",91cpwp,bluecanid,1532393160,64,MensRights,0.34328604,0.057890166,0.009747985

451,"I was playing tag rugby (non contact) in a social league that consists of mixed gender teams over the last 2 months. 

There needs to be 7 players playing per team on the field, 4 guys and 3 girls.   
For scoring tries, Girls are sub sequentially awarded 3 points, whilst guys are awarded only 1.  
I understand the logic behind this as it gets the girls more involved in the game and genuinely makes it more fun/interesting.

Each game lasts 40 mins (20  a half).

\*\*The incident\*\*

After making a line break on the pitch, I spotted a girl on my team (Girl A) who was running a support line on the opposite side of the pitch to me. Naturally I wanted her to score and gain 3 points as opposed to my measly 1 point, so I start running towards her direction to shorten the pass distance.  
Note: During this time she is being chased by a girl (Girl B) on the opposing team.

As I get close enough to Girl A I make the pass to her and accidentally crash into Girl B almost instantly, it completely caught me off guard and sent me and Girl B flying to the ground. (Bear in mind I'm 6""3, 90kg and running flat out, so it was a big collision, but accidental all the same).

As I'm on the ground, a little stunned, I see Girl B in my peripheral lunging at me on the ground whilst cursing something alone the lines of ""you f\*%\^$g b@st@rd.."". 

I immediately knew something was going to happen but not to the extremity of what unfolded.

So after cursing, she clawed at me (leaving two six inch long nail marks on my ribs), then threw and connected a punch to my face with her free hand. She quickly rose from the ground to stand above me, as I was going into the fetal position to try and deflect the initial and future punches. Girl B then delivered 3 kicks, 1 in the back, 1 in the neck and 1 to my head.  
Girl A rushes over and puts herself between me and Girl B, and receives a punch from Girl B.

Then all hell broke loose as both teams tried to contain Girl B, the entire time she is screaming profanities.  
As degrading as it is for me, I was completely shook and disoriented from all the commotion.

The referee gave the girl a yellow card (10 mins off the pitch) for her actions, I felt extremely ill and was unable to play on and had to get a HIA (Head Injury Assessment) as a result.

Thankfully, our team won, despite being a man down and this aggressive woman returning to the field of play.

My team were way more furious at the ref's decision then I was, each team member (including 3 of Girl B's team mates), issued a complaint against to the National Rugby Regulatory Organisation (unnamed for anonymity reasons).

It turns out the ref and Girl B play together for the same local woman's team, which is maybe why she didn't give her a red card instantly (any sort of assault, verbal or physical warrants a red card followed by a usually lengthy ban in this particular type of Rugby).  
The regulatory body changed Girl B's yellow card to a red card, after a review, and a 2 week ban.  
To put this in perspective, I received my only ever red card for cursing at a ref (in full contact rugby) whilst I was on the ground, and received a 4 match ban which ended up being over a 6 week duration. 

A few things to highlight:

  
I am a very gentle, chivalrous guy (the girls on my team joke about this as I called them all ""Lady"" when I wasn't very familiar with there name.), and although I can be competitive I would never intentionally physically assault someone, let alone a girl, and do not think I deserved that kind of retaliation.

Collisions happen all the time and are usually shrugged off in good spirits.

If I had of retaliated to a girl as she did to me, I would be banned for life, probably in prison, most likely facing assault charges, and definitely have the shit kicked out of me.",91s08c,johndoe86888,1532526709,43,MensRights,0.07054565,0.020966014,0.009100696
452,"My boyfriend has been telling me about how at work, all the women keep talking about wanting to get with him. He's kind of new there and most of his coworkers are apparently women, gay, or trans (strangely, since it's just a call center, not a gay bar or anything), which is why they're so interested in him; they don't know he's gay.

And he knows about his popularity with his female coworkers because his supervisor (who's also female) has told him, several times now. ""All the women want to get to know you because all the other guys are ugly or gay. Oh no way! Really? They'll be devastated.""

Last time he was telling me about this he mentioned his supervisor said it was so bad that he has to just let them down quick and tell them all he's gay (facetiously; I'm sure she wasn't insisting he tell that he out himself to everyone, although he'd be perfectly comfortable with that).

Anyway, I jokingly replied, ""You know that's sexual harassment, right?"" But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it literally does fit the definition of workplace sexual harassment. If the sexes were reversed it would absolutely be considered a hostile work environment. Imagine a supervisor informing a lesbian worker that all the men in her workplace want to bang or even just date her, and repeatedly saying she has to let them know she's off the menu.

I'm not saying my boyfriend *should* feel uncomfortable in this situation. But I'm sure as hell not gonna agree that the sex-reversed situation is cause for alarm and a fucking hashtag movement and histrionic one-percenter virtue signaling, either.

So many of the #MeToo claims don't have shit on the treatment that men regularly brush off and don't even think about for the rest of the day when it happens. It's ""empowering"" when women flash men, but Louis C K has to be crucified. Men are ""lucky studs"" when they get with women in positions of power over them, but James Franco's accusers must be believed when they say there was no consent in their interactions with him simply because they were his students (or at least the one who'd dated him was; I barely remember anything about those narcissistic bimbos).

(Also see Vice's story on the problem of female prison guards being ""taken advantage of"" by inmates. ""Oh, so many of them are single mothers and are confused."" So they're being tricked into believing an incarcerated gang member might offer them their dream life and help raise their kids? Please.)

Morgan Freeman...I don't even know WHAT that was about; the accusations were fairly incoherent and seemed to be the product of pregnant woman irrationality and willfully uncharitable, probably racist misinterpretations of some offhand remark during a low-energy interview. But in any case it was definitely a nonissue, and everyone would have thought it such had it happened to a man.

Or—as long as we're being as petty as our female counterparts—how about those BuzzFeed videos where male celebrities (notably *never female* afaik) read their ""thirst tweets""? Are these very tweets not *cyber violence*? Nay, cyber *rape*? (/s, obviously)

When will we admit the blindingly clear absurdity in the whole project, fought for for the past six decades, to diminish sex to a casual and meaningless activity akin to drinking tea, yet at the same time claiming *more puritanically than ever* that any untoward behavior shown to women (who no longer even treat *themselves* and *their own bodies* with respect) demands the most unforgiving retribution? When are we going to admit that sexual liberation was and always will be exclusively for women (as far as heterosexual relations go)? That men are still under as much suspicion for our sexuality as we've ever been and it's only women for whom standards of behavior have been virtually obliterated?

Probably no sooner than we remember all the other things about men and women that our ancestors knew for millennia (which is why they warned us about ""equality"" for many of these same reasons). Yes, women are more vulnerable, physically, and more valuable reproductively. Sex for men is not the same as sex for women, and while the differences are all too exaggerated by social norms, these norms come from indelible instincts following from recognizing the reality of women's physical vulnerability and reproductive value. Given how maladaptive these innate instincts are in today's climate where it's taboo to criticize the pretense that men and women are the same except for reproductive function and should work together in all things, men have every right and reason, in their own self-interest, to distrust women as much as and even more than women distrust men (and oh yes, they do by default).

458,"I stayed for 6 long years day by day with beautiful but very borderline diagnosed girlfriend. She refused the diagnostic and any therapy. She isolated me from the rest of the world with drama, antisocial behaviour, blackmails, screams and recurring violence. 

I never had such beautiful girlfriend so I was drawn in, I supported dedicated to successfully helping her and almost lost my life twice in the process

Readapting to a normal life seems right now like a far away dream. 

Which of these 25 things have happened to you too?


Some of the things she did during these 6 years, which left deep open wounds in me:

 1. She hitted me over my face impulsively with 4 knives, during a verbal disagreement. She was few mm close from cutting out my eyes. Later she said she forgot what was in the bag and behaved like it didn't matter and that her reaction was justified.

 2. After this, she followed me for 3 hours, to stop me from reporting, then hitted herself in the head with the knives until she was bleeding and showed it to me as being my fault. I felt sorry for her and I took her back after promising she'll never be violent again. She didn't keep her promises.


 3.  Sex was indeed very good but only in the first year. Then she lost interest, and it became much much rarer and short. She gave me 3 times three different sexually transmitted diseases. Later I found out that she practiced prostitution for few months, as a ""fulfillment of a fantasy she had""

 5. She was cutting herself, has cutted her wrists while in highschool, and she knew exactly how to cut herself to cut only superficially. To her exboyfriend she broke his head with his mobile phone, because he tried to stop her from cutting herself by hiding her razors. Then he broke up with him.

 6. She tried almost all the drugs she could get for free. She chose her ""model"" nickname after one of her favourite substances she was overdosing herself with to give her strong emotions.

 7. She told me in some mornings ""Everytime you sleep I watch you and I want to kill you. But that's normal, everyone feels the same, but don't worry we only think about it, we don't actually do it""

 8. She told me literally: ""My mother got scared of me when I told her that all children with small heads must be killed""

 9. She hitted me impulsively with whatever she had in her hand more than 6 separate times, although she promised she will not do it again. When she was drinking she became very violent, hitting me with her fists and legs.

 10. She practiced prostitution for 2 months, and she chose for herself a fake name that included the word ""anal"", which she said it was the name of a demon. When I pointed out that it was basically an invitation to anal sex (her favourite), she denied it repeteadly. Then I lost most of my friends, when I continued to talk to her even after she practiced prostitution and got infected with sexually transmitted diseases of course.

11. She was finding exactly what I disliked/hated the most and then repeat exactly that torture for months. For example ice cold hands on my naked abdomen skin.


 12. She bullied 1 or 2 of her highschool colleagues into suicide. Then later, after few years, she was still visiting their cemetery graves and asked me to come and show to me. She was also telling me about the horrible smells from the cemetery, as something interesting for her. 

 13. She isolated me from all my friends, often she would say horrible things like ""You beat up kids! They are not your friends, they hate you or they don't care about you, you are too old,"" and many of such insults.

 14. In the last year it was 5% good moments, and 95% of extreme insults, violence against me, provocations, breaking up with me and then messaging me desperately after 2 days to help her with her imagined new recurring illnesses (she imagines she has recurrent diseases which was not the case, and she took no treatment, but she cries to the doctors about it and then blames the doctors as incompetent)

 15. Often she could not fall asleep until 4-5am in the morning, and she had to watch horror movies in order to fall asleep. As a result it was hard for me to sleep too sometimes. 

 16. She had an obsession of noticing immediately any satan or demons reproductions in her surroundings, and then call them as ""religious"" symbols... 

 17. She was pushing with stick eyes of few dead animals, watching them from closely, she seemed captivated by them, even when they were full of worms.

 18. She bullied her younger brother until he became agoraphobic and asexual. After such a relationship day by day the effects was the alienation and losing my family and my friends, as she manipulated and insulted my friends and me publicly and also in front of my friends constantly. With made-up dramas out of nothing. People escaping out of a relationship with a BPD often develop Post Traumatic Stress disorders.  I definitely have it too, and other very difficult to bear side effects 

 19. Any smallest disagreement with her usually sent her into rages of fury in which she will discuss for many hours until late morning how everything is very wrong and how invariably everything is my fault.

 20. She can never save any money, she always spent all the money she had, the moment she touched the new money no matter if it was her money or not. For many years she spent only my money.

 21. She made alienating false accusations, without any connection with reality, with which she convinced her family and friends that I am some sort of monster. She was twisting the truth in very absurd ways. For example at night she came and walked on my head with her feet, without any care, while I was sleeping. I woke up and I tried to defend myself. She threw herself on the floor and said I pushed her and that I am ""women-beater""

 22. She made up past rape and past ""I was abused"".

 23. She had times when she acted like possesed by demons, with an extreme force she tried to insert things in my body, in order to ""show me how it is to be raped"" although I was fighting hard to not let her do this

 24. Another time she jumped naked in bed next to me, pushing her ass in my face, violently trying to put objects inside my ass while I was shocked and trying to defend myself and saying all the time ""NO! NO!"", then she farted close to my face and laughed

 25. 2 or 3 times, just before after telling me to finish in her, she tells me coldly that ""she wants to have 2 kids with  a gypsy"", another time in the same situation/moment while having sex she says ""I am in love with a guy from work I want to have kids with him"" and the 3rd time, same timing, says ""I want to have a black boyfriend with big muscles"".

469,"I grew up in a conservative household where I was constantly told to just toughen up when it came to my emotional issues while my parents provided my sister with extra care because being a female meant she was more delicate then I was. If I mentioned something was wrong with me they would just think I was paranoid or seeking attention.

Because I was born a male I was groomed to hide my feelings from everyone. I didn't have any sort of emotional support group. If any dark thoughts arised I'd just hide under my bed and sulk alone.

My cousins and friends would constantly poke fun at guys who were soft. Saying things like that they were pussies or not ""real men"". It always bothered me but it was so ingrained into their heads it felt hopeless to argue.

And in the background here I always wondering what was wrong with me? Why was I always worried and paranoid about the future? Why was I always constantly thinking about death? Why was I constantly in tears and unmotivated to do anything? 

My parents would just dismiss it as a teenage hormonal thing. Yet I was stuck in perpetual depression for the longest time. I knew something was wrong but I also thought it was just how life was supposed to be for me.

Until I found Reddit a couple years ago. It was an amazing resource to figure out what other people were like and use that to help figure out myself.

I started doing research and decided that I should go see a psychiatrist with my symptoms. Low and behold at age 22 I was diagnosed with ADD and given meds.

I'm feeling much better now but it bothers me how long it took me to find something like this because of the mentality of the people around me. There's so many men out there stuck depressed or in horrible situations because of how society views us as a gender. My teenage past was absolutely horrible and something I wish to forget. It could've been so much better if I had more support around me.

I encountered this sub recently and it makes me proud that there are others here helping people like me have a bigger voice. There's so many of us out there marginalized and made to feel hopeless because even though were complicated creatures apparantly we're just supposed to sweep all our flaws under the couch!

470,"This is something I struggle with personally most of all. I struggle to make male friends and choose not to be friends with most females so it affects my social life quite a lot.

I feel that society, women and the historically stoic role of men has produced a deep seated resentment from men to other men. I've always had a streak of resentment towards typical male traits myself due to growing up without a father, but of late of begun to long for that connection with my fellow man. Now that I've discovered MRA and seen for myself how it operates I've started to shift my frame of reference to the idea that my resentment comes from an external source trying to make me feel guilty for actions of men that women poorly selected as mates.

So, I'm generally very cagey and cautious. I assume most dudes are assholes or incapable of rewarding friendship. At the same time I'm learning that there are great people out there of all stripes, and that it's mainly my own defences keeping me from making friends with likeminded people.

472,"Men can be bloody bad. We're a species of animal that fought hard to become the dominant super predator and then due to scarse resources and religion and simply not being perfect, we fought each other, and anyone alive today comes from a line of ancestors who left trails of blood in their wake, whatever ethnicity you are. So, we are all killers but most of us hold this instinct in check. A minority of men are awful, but the rest of us get on with building civilisations.

So, yes, some men beat their wives and I am sure the problem's worse with men. But what is also true but nowadays ignored is that often it's the woman who starts striking the man first (he just tends win if indeed he starts hitting back). I have witnessed women launching at men. I've even had partners who would strike me - but it's not in me to retaliate, thankfully. Also, there are guys who do nothing more than attempt to restrain who end up guilty within the system. I've personally seen this as well.

The point I'm coming to is it used to be about that minority of bad men (who had often come up through abuse, perhaps even at the hands of their mums) and a few campaigners also questioned women's part in it until that got beaten down as not politically correct. But now it's become this thing that allows many feminists to go on about men as if we're all bad, as with all this talk about toxic masculinity. Well, 10% of whatever race might be at times incarcerated, but that doesn't mean we get to say that entire ethnicity is all bad. It's gone from a genuine discussion, to dogmatic and fanatical.

He lost custody, despite all this, because they said his life showed ""too much"" routine, which they described as something like too clinical. (It's like being told your bad for being too clean.)

481,"I live in the UK, so I may have overlooked something or perhaps didn’t stress something quite enough, but these are a few things I’ve recently found out. For some reason, there is no huge push to change it. We can’t even vote on these kinds of things. Most of this is aimed towards American society.

1. Women have the right to genital integrity. Regardless of how you personally feel about the practice of circumcision (I personally don’t care because I was raised by Jews), the legal fact is that infant girls are protected against any genital cutting of any kind and infant boys are not. Many will argue that female genital mutilation (FGM) is a magnitude of brutality beyond male genital mutilation and while that may or may not be true, I do not find the “it’s only a little bit brutal” arguement to be very compelling. It’s like saying cutting off a toe is okay because cutting off a foot is much worse. Ultimately, the argument is immaterial to the fact that women have the legal right to be protected from having their body parts sliced off. Men do not.

2. Women have the right to vote without agreeing to die. In the US, citizens are free to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed right to democratically choose their own leaders through the process of casting a ballot in an election once they reach the age of 18. Women achieve this right by the simple act of surviving 18 years. Men may not actualise their basic rights as a citizen without first signing a Selective Service card, in which they agree that at the discretion of the democratically elected government, they will take up arms and die to defend their liberty and way of life. The draft. Men may vote if, and only if, they agree they will face death if required. Women have no such obligation, but they do get to vote for the governments that can potentially send men to meet death. Again, regardless of how you feel about the draft, women have the right to vote without agreeing to be drafted. Men don’t.

3. Women may surrender a child for adoption without notifying or identifying the father or they may surrender the infant under Safe Haven laws and walk away from all responsibility and obligation. Women cannot, which they shouldn’t, be forced or coerced into parenthood, but they are legally allowed to force men into financing their reproductive choices. In many states, men can be forced into financial responsibility for children whom they did not biologically father. As long as a particular man is identified as the father, he will be held accountable. Paternity fraud is legal. In no state is legal paternal surrender permitted without the express agreement of the mother. Again, regardless of whether you agree or disagree with legal paternal surrender, the fact remains that women have the legal right to choose parenthood. Men do not.

4. Women have the right to be assumed caregivers for children. When parental relationships irretrievably break down, current custody laws assume one primary caregiver (almost always a woman) and one tertiary caregiver (almost always a man). In order to win equal or shared custody, the tertiary caregiver must litigate to prove they are worthy of equal parenting, a proposition that is not only very difficult to “prove”, it is also very expensive. The legal presumption of shared parenting upon divorce – that children have a legal right to an equal relationship with both their mother and their father following relationship breakdown – is strongly resisted by the National Organization for Women (NOW) and other feminist organizations who know that women will almost always win custody of children under the default laws. In actual fact, men who can afford to purse legal remedies and challenge primary custody stand a good chance of winning, because women do not have the market cornered on loving or caring for children. So while the law does not specifically indicate that custody will be awarded to women, the defacto result of primary/tertiary caregiver custody law is that women have a legal right to be assumed caregivers for children. Men do not.

5. The original FBI definition of rape specifically identified women as the victims, excluding the possibility of male rape victims. When the FBI updated that, it did so in way that includes a small minority of male rape victims but excluded most male rape victims by retaining the “penetration” clause. Penetration of any orifice must occur for rape to have happened. The FBI does collect another set of statistics though, under the category of “other sexual assault” – it’s the awkwardly named “made to penetrate” category, which includes men who were coerced, tricked or bullied into penetrative sex with women they would otherwise not have had sex with. The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey similarly considers the two types of assault separately, despite the fact that occurrences are virtually identical. 1.27M women report rape (p.18)  and 1.26M men report “made to penetrate” (p.19).  By collecting the information under separate categories, following the legal definitions, women have the right to have their rapes called “rape”. Men do not.

490,"Yep. Sexist male attitudes against women have meant we've been too easy and soft on them for too long. We've got to stop letting women win arguments, especially about the patriarchy, just because they're women. By not actually challenging them to produce clear evidence and rationale, we've allowed too many of them to develop sloppy thinking (viewpoints that have not had to stand up to close scrutiny). It is deeply unfair of us. It really is a consequence of sexism against women - we should be treating them as equals and helping to stand up against the fanatics in their midst. Their woman's studies groups - now often rebranded as gender studies - is rife with idealogues who are immune from the robust challenges of serious male-dmoniated academia because few men join them, and when they do, they better tow the line of the echo chamber, or they'll learn the depth of ""Hell hath no fury..."". So, it's allowed them to get away with decades of group think, which is now washing over to society in general.

One challenge to stand up to now is that of the pay gap and the socialist call for equal outcomes. Can't fix one gap without addressing all the others that stand against men. If men were equally likely to win custody battles, there would be more women forced into battling along in their careers to pay child support (as men have had to do, forcing them to fight for promotions and a raise), so correcting one gap would help to correct the other.

But can't do this when the toxic feminist narrative is it's always the fault of the patriarchy (actually, it is, since male dominated law set up these systems to benefit women) and men can never be right and women can never be wrong - their feminist sites are about equality, no matter how many women there are really just bitching about all men; and our manosphere is always misogyny, no matter how man men like me are just here to raise genuine points.

492,"Okay, I'm going to cut an unnecessarily long story short and get to the chase as I want some genuinely good feedback. I'm one of the younger men in this subreddit. I'm wrapping up high school, I'm taking college classes, I work part time, and have a lot going for me. The big problem I'm facing is my romantic life but the biggest is coming face to face with feminism.

I live in a very rich area and of course, being on college campus, the both of them work together to become a liberal breeding ground but also a big time feminist breeding ground. I have a lot of problems with feminists but one of my biggest comes to dating and all of their drama. It's amazing to me that feminists believe they're entitled to a good man like me when they're entitled to trash. With their false rape accusations, lack of honesty, lack of respect, lack of significant value in cultures, customs, and traditions, and just simply acting so brash and out of line, dating a feminist would be an absolutely hellish experience.

I have never had a girlfriend before and the big reason I've somewhat restrained my endeavors in romance is because of the feminists I always have to share classes with. I'm a traditional, conservative, southern, country boy only living in this town because my mother had a love for it being a feminist herself and with her starting a business, she brought me along with her here. I've been disrespected and verbally assaulted by women before in my college and high school classes for me fighting back when they said something I disagreed with or I even just simply wanted to talk to them and strike up conversation. I even made a controversial slideshow presentation about red pill dating and that got me all sorts of hateful comments and text messages. The fact I rocked that project with an A and made every single feminist's in the class spine crawl is one of the greatest memories of my life. In total, I've probably asked out 30 some girls since around the age of 16 and I've not had luck in finding love.

Despite how men lack so much on the rights in marriage, sex, and paternity, my heart still longs and I wish to find love but it must be with the right person. It's fair statement that I am red pill or for more accurate definition, a dark purple piller. I want to be able to find a girlfriend who is not just only NOT a feminist but perhaps a men's rights supporter herself. I've been taken advantage of by women in the past and it's made me at some points, turn cold and extremely cynical of the opposite sex but I cling on to hope I will find someone.

493,"I asked this question in the OneY sub and thought it was worth asking here too. Male birth control is one of those things that has always been on the horizon, but never makes it to market for any number of reasons. The last few years have been promising, though. Some are already in human trials and could be available in just a few years.

This could be a huge game-changer in terms of gender dynamics. For decades, women have enjoyed a lot of options for long-term birth control. Men have only had two, condoms and vasectomies. More options means more control over male fertility, but like female birth control, it's going to come at a price. And also like female birth control, it's probably going to be pretty expensive at first.

So how expensive is too expensive? Say, for the sake of argument, the implant lasts about 5 years, which is about the same as certain IUDs for women.

495,"""Forced"" marriages still exist in many parts of the world, and not only feminists but also Western atheists and conservatives use this to attack many non-Western societies.

But, is it really that simple?

First, they are not ""forced"" marriages, but arranged marriages. 

Second, often both men and women are ""forced"" into marriages. Are we prepared to call all such men ""oppressed""?

Third, people who are forcing them into marriages are their own parents, who love their children the most and want the best for them. If women are ""forced"" into marriages because of hatred for women, then it must be parents who hate their own female children. This makes no sense.

Fourth, the fact that women are ""forced"" into marriages more than men does not necessarily mean that this is done to oppress women. Generally, what happens is that a man ""applies"" for a marriage to a woman's family and then her family decides whether he is good enough. A woman may not marry whom she likes (well, duh, neither can a man) but this is because parents want to ensure that her daughter gets the best husband. 

Fifth, the fact that men are not ""forced"" into marriages is not because they are privileged, but because parents don't give a damn about choosing the perfect wife for their son. Women are assumed to be good wives by default, whereas men are looked at more suspiciously, and so a potential husband has to be more carefully considered than a potential wife. Even in Western societies, a woman's family will look more deeply into the man she wants to marry than the man's family will look into the woman.

Sixth, feminists (and atheists and Western conservatives....) take this as an example of restriction of female freedom. They say: ""A woman cannot marry whom she wants!!! Misogyny!!!"" Uhm...... can a man marry whomever he wants? Is it a restriction of my freedom and human rights that I cannot marry my favorite swimsuit model?

497,"""Kill them with love"" played straight. I've noticed we've already become less focused on where feminism attacks us and more moved that energy towards shedding light on where women are treated with more leniency and care than men. But a real commitment to holding feminism to a more neutral position with us could be helpful in making the misandry over there die down, as well as reminding the equity feminists that feminism isn't supposed to be an ideology to advance female privilege while further keeping men in a position as utilities.

Ultimately, I believe the MRM will have a lot of effect on feminist stance in the future and if the MRM can stand with women's rights as a subject while keeping feminism as an entity in a more indifferent standing it will force feminism to disappear as an ideology seeing as it would have no place and be seen as completely out of line.

The most famous example of this was when Karen and honeybadgers were accused of defending certain 3rd world gender-related practices.

499,"I think something that gets overlooked in this sub is the fundamental thought pattern behind Men's Rights and feminism. 

Feminism is, at its core, a identity politics movement. It frames history and the world as a struggle between groups (in this case, genders) in which one side inevitably is losing. Your morality, the validity of your words, and everything about you is prejudged by which group you belong to, according to that group's place in society. Feminism then adds a layer of equality of outcome to try to ensure that women gain a minimum of 50% of any benefits that society allocates, and ignores any presupposition that an oppressed group can have any privileges whatsoever. 

Men's Rights, on the other hand, is essentially an individual, equality of opportunity movement. Obviously, everyone starts with different disadvantages and advantages, but in the realm of gender we believe that men and women should have equal rights but differences in their outcomes should be left to the individuals making their own choices. We also disagree with biases based on groups that apply to individuals, such as the legal system in many countries, as we regard individuals as not slaves to their group dynamic.

Viewing individuals as merely a representation of their supposed groups, whether racial, sexual, or gender, is the definition of discrimination. Feminism is based on a desire to separate, not liberate.

Isn't our scope of action too constricted? It doesn't even make sense that the group that was privileged for thousands of years (in every country, in every city, in every village, in every family) has suddenly over two decades or so become awfully oppressed. This has never happened in human history, unless there was a violent conflict or a catastrophe or something of that sort.

And the way in which we claim that men are oppressed and disadvantaged today (suicide, workplace deaths, shorter life expectancy, empathy gap,...) are nothing new, with possible exception of family and custody laws. These disadvantages were always there. 

And furthermore, the ways in which women were oppressed can be said to still be present. If women were oppressed in the past because they rarely occupied positions of power, had less property and earned less money, and were obliged to take care of children, well, take a wild guess which gender still rarely occupies positions of power, earns less and takes care of children more. What is the difference between women occupying 5% of Congress seats and women occupying 19% of Congress seats? If men want to oppress women, they can still do it with 81% of seats in Congress. You don't need 95 or 100 percent.

From a Martian's perspective, not that much has really changed in the last 50 or even 100 years.  If women were so awfully oppressed 50 or 100 years ago, then they are still oppressed.

**Where have all the good men gone?**

I was on the train and seeing a woman standing, I gave up my seat 

Showing respect for women was something you could depend upon

But then this became ‘benevolent sexism’ and, in a heartbeat

Ms magazine ran a story ""Where have all the good men gone?""

We were taught that good manners meant that you open the door

""Be a gentleman!"", but that's a 'micro-aggression' to be frowned upon 

Masculinity is now an illness, for which only feminism is the cure 

And Cosmopolitan laments ""Where have all the good men gone?""

“Hey single dude, time to leave behind the drinking and the gaming 

Are you an incel? How much longer can adolescence drag on?

”Men ‘can’t commit’ and are 'called out' in an orgy of male shaming 

And the panel on The View ask, ""Where have all the good men gone?""

I remember the courage it took to ask her name, to take that leap

I marvel at how I put my heart on the line, to take a chance on 

There being a spark. But if there isn’t, you're 'a sexist creep!'

And The Washington Post muses ""Where have all the good men gone?""

The 'Y' chromosome sure is bad, whatever the problem, it's men's fault 

We are liable for any crime committed from New York to Washington 

Presumed guilty of crimes from manspreading to sexual assault

And Moms in line ask each other ""Where have all the good men gone?""

No two feminists seem to agree about any definitions of feminism 

'Not all feminists are like that', they are all unique, every one 

Why then are all men labelled the same? Isn't this collectivism? 

""Educate yourself! (and where have all the good men gone?)”

What’s the standard to be a 'good man'? Do we have to pass a test? 

Being human is to be fallible when all is said and done

Who is it judging others when they're just doing their best? 

Blaming ""toxic masculinity"" then mourning ""Where have all the good men gone?”

""Oh no no, you misunderstand! We don't hate men, do some research!”

But they do, of course, and bit by bit they become more bitter

A belief system perverted by zealots, like the Westboro Baptist Church

512,"Having talked with the mods and a number of other people on here it seems like there is a real hunger for a fully functioning MRA wiki and website for the moderates on the reddit, and since I have webspace and some experience I thought I'd step up.

You are all welcome to make suggestions, help, and give feedback. And I'm really hoping someone has a great idea for a killer name or URL we can use! We'll also need artists to help design a logo and icons if any are about and would like to chip in.

# What The Site Itself Will Contain

Front page will be a branching design leading to the following:

* A one-stop wiki-style database of all the best arguments and information we have. We will cover literally everything from male inequalities and problems to heavyweight debunkings of things like Patriarchy, each with its own neat page. The idea of this is to place all our strongest information on topic based pages. This would solve the problem of our information mainly being lost in blogs and reddit posts that last a day. This database will be fully cited and open only to approved editors to avoid us being vandalized.
* A XenForro based forum intended to act as a community hub for the reddit. It will be open to everyone and we will have both instant chat and several catagories, such as an 'Ask and MRA' style subforum.
* A feed of all the best news, blogs, and so on. There will be a dedicated feed for events the MRA are putting on.
* A section devoted entirely to all those overlooked personal stories that litter the reddit. Everyone here has at least one, and has seen dozens. We need to bring these right to the foreground and show people how this affects us on a day to day level. Everyone who has a story, be it text or video or just sound, will have a chance to offer it up. The most hearbreaking will go right on the front page and be stored in a permanent archive. This may be built as a blog, but we'll see what works best.
* Another section focusing on people who attack the movement, showing them at their worst. This will not just be feminists or SJWs, but there will be absolutely no videos of us bullying them because that needs to stop and I refuse to encourage it. Arguments are fine, however.

And now this is where you come in, because this is incredibly ambitious. I will create the basic front page, database, and forum to start with - but each and every one of these things will require multiple people to work on them. We're going to need moderators, a news team to pick stories, and especially people to fill out the database. I already have a few people asking, and I've had some great responses. 

# Here's what I'm looking for

Aside from ideas on a URL we need moderate and thoughtful people ready to create content! We don't want to be the kind of site that people point to to ridicule the MRA, so there won't be any trolling of feminists or meltdowns on twitter. If the movement is ever to be successful we have to be better than our critics by a mile.

We will not be another angry voice that doesn't get listened to.

513,"I received a message online from an ex girlfriends friend (the ex was blocked on all social media years ago because she was contacting my now wife with bullshit stories to try and mess with me). The short version is that the ex is claiming that I’m the father of her now 12 year old son. It came out of nowhere. I remember that she got pregnant shortly after we broke up (she cheated on me many times, ironically the friend she used to get to me was the one who told me about the cheating because she felt bad). But she admitted to me in person at the time that she was pregnant by an old boyfriend who they thought couldn’t have kids. Also, I always used a condom with her. Every single time. Despite her claim of a latex allergy smh

She said in her message that she had all the other guys (apparently there were many) paternity tested and all came back negative so by default it must be my kid. I looked up her Facebook and found pictures of the kid. Looks absolutely nothing like me. 

She’s married with a second kid and by all accounts they seem like a normal stable family. I dont trust her at all because she was always a liar and manipulator back then and I don’t much has changed.

I’m currently married with two kids myself. I really think this is just a bunch of bullshit and her just messing with me, and I seriously doubt the kid is mine when you account for the condom use, the timeline is close but I don’t think it fits with the timeframe of us banging, the admission from her that it was another guys kid back then, and the fact that he looks nothing like me.

Easier hygiene. Circumcision makes it simpler to wash the penis. However, boys with uncircumcised penises can be taught to wash regularly beneath the foreskin.

Decreased risk of urinary tract infections:

The risk of urinary tract infections in males is low, but these infections are more common in uncircumcised males. Severe infections early in life can lead to kidney problems later.

Decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections:

Circumcised men might have a lower risk of certain sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Still, safe sexual practices remain essential.

Prevention of penile problems: 

Occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis can be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis). This can lead to inflammation of the foreskin or head of the penis.

Decreased risk of penile cancer:

Although cancer of the penis is rare, it's less common in circumcised men. In addition, cervical cancer is less common in the female sexual partners of circumcised men.

ANDERSON — A young Pendleton woman who reported to police on July 3 that a young man sexually assaulted her while jogging at Mounds State Park was actually participating in a rape fantasy, Sheriff Scott Mellinger said Monday.

As a result, 19-year-old Marguerite ""Maggie"" Wallace was arrested and charged with one count of Class A misdemeanor false informing and is being held at the Madison County Jail on $3,000 bond, Mellinger said.

""Maggie Wallace initially denied the new information but ultimately admitted she didn't tell investigators the truth when she filed a report of being sexually assaulted,"" Mellinger said.

That new information came to light Monday.

Using credit card information, Madison County Sheriff's Department investigators tracked down a 17-year-old Indianapolis male teenager who told them he met Wallace through an application called ""whisper,"" a social media site where participants usually communicate anonymously.

""The juvenile claimed he responded to a post from the female who was looking for someone to fulfill a 'rape fantasy,' "" Mellinger said.

The teen told investigators he had conversations with Wallace and they agreed to meet at the state park in Anderson.

The young man, who cooperated with investigators, saved screenshots on his phone of his conversations with Wallace, which confirmed his version of the events that occurred at Mounds State Park, Mellinger said.

Wallace initially told police a man sneaked up behind her while jogging, grabbed her and forced her to the ground.

But Wallace said she fought back by punching and scratching the man in the face.

A person nearby who witnessed the attack ran over to help and called 911.

For example, if there's even minor sexual harassment against a woman or girl, it will be mentioned. While they downplay or even **entirely neglect to mention** the sexual violence against males in films. There are a lot of films where they've done the latter, e.g. (some possible spoilers)

 - ""The Glass Castle"", where they mention a man trying to coax a woman into sex, but say *absolutely nothing* about the scene of the grandmother molesting her grandson, or the implication that she molested her own son in that same movie
 - ""The Witch"", where they mention a young boy leering at his sister, but nothing about the witch in the form of a nude woman kissing the same pre-teen boy for several seconds later on (they only say ""nothing sensitive is shown"", so I guess they don't consider a nude woman kissing a child in an attempt to seduce him anything ""sensitive"")
 - ""It Follows"", where they neglect to mention the entity raping a man to death (while it's in the form of his mother)
 - ""Knock Knock"", where they also neglect to mention that the **two women rape the main character,** instead *saying that he ""cheats""* on his wife with them
 - ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", where they don't mention the scene of the aunt molesting her nephew
 - ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", where naturally they mention all the bondage with Anastasia, but nothing about the 15-year-old boy being groomed by his mother's friend into being her sexual submissive in a BDSM relationship

Hello. Today in class we had a roleplay activity where the class was split into 2 groups, “bosses” and “employees.” Our job as the employees was to make signs that we’ll use against the bosses to raise our pay. (Something like a boycott.) The second sign that our group made was about, obviously, the pay gap. Me being the antifeminist that I am, told them that the wage gap is a poorly presented statistic that only takes into account the average pay of men and average pay of women without taking any variables into account, such as hours worked, sick days taken, etc. Immediately, both the guys and girls started bashing me, saying that the pay gap is true. 

Then came the presenting part. Our group started protesting for the stuff we wrote on our posters and the “bosses” reacted.  Afterwards the teacher told us what we did good and bad, and he mentioned how I criticized the wage gap. He said that the gap exists and that it was alright to have it on a poster, and assigned me a challenge to write an essay (unmarked) where there is proof and arguments fighting to prove that the wage gap is false. He then asked everybody else whether anybody would want to write an essay in support that the wage gap exists, but nobody wanted to. So the teacher took the job upon himself.

Now, I have the proof that the wage gap doesn’t exist. However, I do not want to get into an argument where he says “it exists” and I say “it doesn’t exist.” Can you please find any arguments that the teacher might use to prove that the wage gap exists?

More recruitment was done to try and find candidates for the role who were specifically female, and none were found. Instead of interviewing more male candidates or offering the positions to previous interviewees who were good enough to deserve an offer, they didn't offer the position to anyone. Recruitment have now closed the final 2 positions. I find this deeply saddening, the roles are competitive as we get nearly 1000 applications and good candidates are being turned away because they are male.

538,"I honestly can't remember when feminism became such an major influence on my life.

But if I had to guess, it'd probably be somewhere in my sophomore year while attending one of silicon valleys most ""progressive"" high schools. This school was supposed to be a new haven for forward thinking in technology and inclusiveness. During my time there, students were encouraged to adopt liberal, feminist and sjw ideology. The students who openly refused to do so however were looked down upon and often treated with disdain by teachers and most other staff members.

You could not openly debate the idea of feminism because teachers would retort that ""you need to be inclusive of everyone's ideas"" as they shot your voice and opinion down in a fashion almost to imply that you were ""ignorant"". This of course, was often done in the classroom for all of your peers to see. 

When Trump came into presidency, 40% of students came to school in tears, some students didn't come at all. The select few who were marked as black sheep for subscribing to non-liberal ideologies became targets for those wanting to take out their grievances on anything that resembled ""the enemy"". School wide moments of silence meant to show respect for the deceased became mandatory assemblies to respect the feelings of those who struggled emotionally with reality. This happened as if to foreshadowe the modern idea that emotion trumps rationality and reality. Classes were cancelled and replaced with meditative group talks were set in place to ""discuss"" conflicting ideologies which in practice, only really served as an arena for left wing students and faculty to single out and ostracize the far and few right wingers. 

My qualm, atleast at first, was not with feminism, sjw, liberals, or anything of that nature, it was with which ferocity that any opposing and non-aligning views were shot down. To be clear I am neither right or left wing.

As life moved on and I entered college, things really didn't change for the better. Students with opposing views crawled under the woodwork in hopes to remain unseen. *Free speech* and *free think* became censored speech and wrong think. The things I have witnessed in my high school years have only been dwarfed by today's standards. Social justice warriors now have their own version of the crusaders from which they seek and social-economically destroy anyone they can find committing wrong think. I've watched it all unfolded and frankly appalled and even more so terrified with the fact that there are entire communities of men who who have congregated online because they feel that society is throwing us away **AND HAVE DONE NOT A SINGLE THING** about this. 

You guys. We've all ***SEEN*** it. Your neighbors seen ***it***. Its there in the shadows of the internet, taking us one by one. You all know what I'm talking about. No doubt men have died for a lot worse in human history, however at least their death would not have been so cruelly dragged on with unfair alimony and parental child laws or other. Granted I'm sure some men deserve what has come to them, but I'm just as sure that there are men who are being wrongly stripped of their job, children, friends, family, money, achievements, and much more.

I know there are some old farts out here in the crowd who will say ""to just look the other way"" or to ""just wait it out"". I mean how long do we sit in silence until we've decided this IS persecution?? Truly, ask your self. How much can we loose before we decide we're being wronged? and what if by the time we realize, its too late? We have the means, just look at this community and others alike. I know we're men and we hold the worlds burden to just drudge on, but we're also creators of the modern world for fucks sake. I mean who built the first sky scraper? The biggest of empires? The great pyramids? Who flew dog fighters into the horrors of each and every world war? What filled the trenches of war and innovation? Men have. We have done it all, and for what? To be treated the way we are? Granted we are loosing our touch, that atleast is pretty evident. History and greatness however fills our veins and we haven't even conquered space yet. Now don't think for a second that this applies only to men of one color or demographic. This is on every single one of **you** reading this. We are all on this planet together and we all stem from the same one cell which procreated. What matters only is how we treat one another as well as our accomplishments as a human race. Civility and brotherhood above all.

That being said we need to unionize and develop collective bargaining power across all fields of work and law. We need to develop and form think tanks with the sole purpose of benefiting our men and our country. We need to regain control of our nation and restore our place at the top of the world. As for men of other countries in the same situation, I fully implore that you join us. The US has always been a boiling pot of men of all races and ethnicity. Black, brown, or white we need to stop being racist against one another and put the past behind us so we can work for a better tomorrow. And if not for yourself, is this the world that you want your future children to live in?

So please, get as many people involved. Talk to your friends, family, fishing buddies, local NRA members, car groups, AA confidantes, local bars, mens clubs, fraternities, trade unions. We all have a something to gain here, not just as MRA, but as men from every work sector, political affiliation and social clubs.

545,"It is my opinion that modern day feminism is an amalgamation of peoples with internal issues of insecurity about their own lives attempting to create an artificial, chronic struggle that replicates the natural law of gratification through survival. People that take up causes such as modern day, “third wave”, and what I refer to as “first world feminism”, have had the natural and traditional survival aspect of their lives diminished to the point where basic human needs do not need to be fought and struggled for on a daily basis. In layman’s terms, my suggestion is that the feminists of today view themselves passively, or possibly actively, yet internally as uninteresting and boring with little in their own lives that promotes excitement or enjoyment to gratify the self. As a defense mechanism of sorts, these people – both males and females – take up causes (such as feminism) to add excitement and challenge to their everyday lives as a subliminal replacement or rejuvenation to the modernly underutilized yet natural and unending trial for food, water, shelter and the need to reproduce. Social causes, such as feminism, are often in view of the general public eye as well, which adds the effect of positive reinforcement through others that believe in the same cause due to their own suffering of the aforementioned issue of internal insecurity. Electronic media tools such as social media and digital, informational hardware technologies (i.e. smart phones, tablets, and other mobile devices) tend to elevate the public status of such causes. There comes a point where those susceptible to summing up the worth of their own life in a purely pessimistic fashion inevitably do so in an act(s) of self-reflection – either fleeting or gradual –, and visualize their lives as uninteresting, without merit and/or without potential of legacy. Unfortunately, the causes this type of person joins, revives, supports, or even creates – including but not limited to feminism (“Black Lives Matter” as a prime example), are either outdated, extinguished to the point where they are no longer urgent social issues, absolutely nonexistent in the first place and are therefore fabricated, or are simply based on isolated incidents expanded to the point of mass outrage via the snowball effect through public exposure. Those active participants in groups dedicated to such causes should really be viewed as potential victims of substandard mental health brought on by the unnatural establishment of society.",96jrap,drebinhasyou,1534020610,6,MensRights,0.20572066,0.07903719,0.009722093

549,"Last night I went out with 2 lesbians (1 of which presented herself as a man) and a straight woman and we ended up in a gay club. They were all very nice people and I enjoyed hanging out with them.
However, during the night the lesbians defined manhood too me, explained why masculinity is inherently toxic, and avoided understanding the plight of male workers or their rights. They were shocked that I would even discuss such topics. The straight woman eventually talked with me one on one and agreed with a lot of the things I was saying. The lesbians laughed at me when I asked if their was a difference in being victimized or decided to be a victim after giving them my personal experience and perspective on victimization and the choice to feel that way. 

It feels like men aren’t really allowed to discuss so many things like male suicide rates, injuries or death in the work place, child custody laws, or the things about female culture that are toxic. 

Their perspective feels like all the worlds troubles are made by men and they can blame all men for them. I felt like they were shocked that I did not agree with them on an inherent level as if their perspective is the end all be all truth of the world. 

They said Misandry and toxic Femininity are made up things even while saying things that could be labeled misandrist and toxic. My Instagram feed and popular television would also disagree. 

None of them had an example of unequal pay in their lives personally. Nor had any of them ever worked a difficult high paying labor driven job like construction. 
When I asked why their are no woman working jobs like electrician or plumbing that pay really well and have record low employment rates they sad men are also to blame because we are sexist. I’ve never once seen a woman complaining about unequal pay on a construction site. Nor have I ever seen a woman be paid less than a man for the same work in any field I’ve ever worked. 

Eventually we quit talking about this stuff and danced.

I don’t have a lot of hope after last night. I tried to have a reasonable conversation and try to understand their side because I’m curious how someone’s perspective can be so different from mine but I won’t have someone define who I am to me especially when they literally have zero experience or understanding on what it is to be me. 
I realized that I don’t get to blame anyone for what I don’t have. They feel like they can blame men. I think I’m stronger for the self reliance and lack of blame and bitterness.

551,"Apologies if this is something that’s been discussed in length, but there’s something I’d like to get everyone’s opinion on. That being the potential of overlapping ideas between red pill think and feminism. The classic narrative of course is that these are opposing sides, and in many ways that’s true, but aren’t there a lot of areas where the two ideologies converge? Especially when it comes to sexuality and promiscuity?

Both groups seem to think of marriage and monogamy as a trap, with feminists claiming that it’s a patriarchal structure meant to control women’s sexuality, while men view it as only suitable for beta males. A trap meant to bleed alphas dry and reduce them to a husk of their former selves. Robbing them of their agency. The reality of course might be that it’s both. That both sides are starting to realize these institutions as a sham. Simply a way for beta desperate males to try and control women, which both strengthens the patriarchy (in the feminist view) and ultimately bites said men in the ass (in the MRA view).

For that reason is it reasonable to believe that both have come to the same conclusion in regards to monogamy? That hypergamy is a natural phenomenon, and that both men and women are meant to perpetually live in a state of sexual promiscuity? That men only want to control women either for child rearing or fear of not being able to find another mate, and that women only want to control men for resources while it’s convenient for them? Both are cynical views that believe the notion of love is a construct that only benefits the desperate.

552,"For example, I live in an Eastern European country, one of the poorest ones (and therefore, supposedly, one the most patriarchal and traditionalist ones). I can tell you that feminism is way more crude and dismissive and one-sided than in the West. By the way, when I say ""feminism"" I don't just mean feminism in the narrow sense, but more generally the whole aggressive and annoying campaigning for supposed equality. 

I'll give you one example. You all know Erin Pizzey, Murray Straus, Donald Dutton and the research they did regarding family violence. Their research goes back to 1970s and their research has from the very start taken into account violence against men, and that is how you in the West can counter the feminist claims and lies about DV. Today, even liberal newspapers such as NYTimes cannot so easily regurgitate the feminist lies about DV. 

In my country, in the other hand, nobody has ever done a study that took into account female-on-male violence. There is literally not a single figure about male victims that an opponent of feminists can cite in a debate. This allows feminists and other supposed fighters for gender equality to say whatever they want. One of the most respectable weeklies here can publish an article that says: ""Male victims of DV are ***microscopic*** compared to female ones"". 

Government has established a number of agencies that enable female empowerment in order to ingratiate themselves with EU, USA, UN, OSCE,... Nobody even mentions various male problems, which are the same as in Western democracies.

There are feminist NGOs that publish ""research"" and ""studies"" (funded by Swedish and Norwegian embassy, by OSCE, United Nations, European Union, Open Society, USAID, various US foundations etc) which are way more crude and ideological than the gender-related research in the West. These studies are then cited in media, in government policy papers,.... 

Since the country is small and with little tradition of free inquiry, there is little room for public debate. Whoever corners the market first, wins. In this case, feminists. 

Liberal media here is even worse than the Western. For example, in USA, there is TIME magazine, a liberal paper, which, even though it publishes feminist propaganda, also allows CHS and Camille Paglia and Cathy Young to occasionally challenge it. Here, OTOH, there is no way that a liberal paper would allow an article that in any way challenges feminists dogma and the claims of patriarchal oppression.

And, by the way, this is a country that has way more women in parliament than US and Canada (more than EU average), where 70% of judges are female, where women make up 60% of university students, wage gap is insignificant (because wages are small), women are less likely to be murdered than in Canada and US, women live 5.10 years longer than men, women make up 2.6% of prison population, ...

Last weekend I was performing improv theatre at a community event. It's usually a fun time where you can be silly and step outside yourself.

One of the games we played was ""arms experts"" where we get two players and two audience members onstage, and the audience members stand behind the players and use their own arms in place of the characters. My audience member was 20 years my senior, and female.

What happened next surprised me. While I was introducing myself, the audience member grabbed my genitals open handed and squeezed. I was mortified... but even moreso when the audience just laughed. I didn't want to break down the fourth wall and so I stayed in character, until the scene was over. I probably tried to brush it off but now, a few days later, see how much I was violated.

So my question is, why would the audience just stand there and laugh? People knew that the scene was not scripted.

So now I wonder, Should I have made a scene and ask that the audience member leave? Do I press charges? Do I just laugh about it and move on? I'm a bit conflicted at the moment.",97arfe,whererusteve,1534270735,81,MensRights,0.22846605,0.16773392,0.018537397
558,"I've been thinking a lot about how men are victims of domestic violence at nearly the same rates that women are. And domestic violence IS a soul-crushing thing, when it's real. I had a drunk, violent mom, and a teetotalling violent girlfriend, and it was horrible. I wish we could make it go away.   


But I'm starting to think that the whole notion of ""domestic violence laws"" is just Machiavellian social engineering, and men (and women!) would be better off campaigning to get rid of them alltogether, and relying on the perfectly serviceable **assault** laws that have been on the books for ages. I know this sounds extreme at first, but it's like hate crime laws: Racism definitely exists, but hate crime laws don't do anything to decrease it, and they only create perverse incentives to prosecute people unfairly, while simultaneously allowing the Sarah Jeongs of the world to get off scot free. Worse still, when we try to get men recognized as victims of domestic violence, we're actually doing the feminists' work for them, by reinforcing the necessity of a domestic violence apparatus in the first place, and anyway: let's get real, most people are NEVER going to give two shits that men get abused.   


This becomes especially obvious, when you notice that the second men started identifying themselves as victims of domestic violence, the lingo got changed and now it's ""Gender violence"", or ""violence against women"". And most of us have a habit of thinking of the false accusation epidemic as some kind of misunderstanding, or just bad women abusing a system that was created for good reasons. But I don't think the system was created for good reasons, because look how the definition is evolving. First there was **violence violence**. We can all pretty much agree that that's bad. Then it grew to include **""psychological violence""**, which is also bad, but nobody can agree what it is, natural human biases tend to excuse most of what women do, and psychologists, with their vast replication crisis (65%!), and history of toadying up to repressive regimes (all totalitarian societies used psychologists to stifle repression)  are really the LAST people you want in a court room, ever. Now, we've got **""economic violence""**, which is really just begging someone to call it a complete, utter, cruel joke. I've explained the problem with ""economic violence"" on other threads, so I won't go too far into it here. Doesn't matter which kind they arrest you for either, once you're convicted, once you're accused, domestic violence is domestic violence and nobody cares which flavor of it you've been convicted for.   


Yes, a person who beats his or her spouse should be legally responsible for assault, assuming that's what the attacked party wants. (People in less ""advanced"" countries tend not to involve the police in their private lives as much, which isn't to say they don't care about violence, they just have other ways of dealing with it.) But **assault laws already exist. Child protection laws also exist already.** Let's consider something else. Your wife can go over to your neighbor's house. Your neighbor can slap her, and it's just garden variety assault.

Anyways, I am far ok with the child and wish I could just have full custody. Always wanted a kid and have no problem taking of the kid PHYSICALLY. I am not ok with child support by law. 

So my question is, is there something her and I can agree on like like a cohabitational agreement or something where we establish a understanding that is things go wrong child support cannot come into the picture but also she cannot keep the kid away from me cause that will be awful as it is a creation of mine and I want to spend time with the kid.

What is funny about it is that what resulted in my blocking was posting fifteen quotes from prominent feminists. I suppose I the moderators couldn’t risk feminist acolytes being exposed to such unbridled sexism. It may have made some of them begin to re-examine their hateful ideology.

Some examples of the quotes I posted were:

And if the professional rapist is to be separated from the average dominant heterosexual (male), it may be mainly a quantitative difference. - Susan Griffin

I feel that 'man-hating' is an honourable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them. - Robin Morgan

My feelings about men are the result of my experience. I have little sympathy for them. Like a Jew just released from Dachau, I watch the handsome young Nazi soldier fall writhing to the ground with a bullet in his stomach and I look briefly and walk on. I don’t even need to shrug. I simply don’t care. What he was, as a person, I mean, what his shames and yearnings were, simply don’t matter. - Marilyn French

She says ""Cool, would you give me some"", I said sure , no problem. 

So she does her research and asks me to help her plant the seeds in her garden , which I do.

Fast forward to today, her pumpkins are growing , well like, ahhhh, pumpkins. In other words they have taken over her garden, they have killed all her flowers, the tomato plants she had are gone, so are the squash and beets.

She arrives at my house and is furious and says she is going to sue me for the costs of all the plants that my little seeds destroyed. I tell her ""You asked me for the seeds and it was your choice to plant the, to water them, to ensure they were germinated etc etc. She retorts with ""They were your seeds and without them my garden would still be intact"".

(2) Silence on how men are underperforming in education and not going to college at the same rates. Instead of blaming men, there needs to be advocacy and incentives. If it were women not going to college at the same rates as men, there would be so much advocacy and programs suited to fix that disparity.

570,"Ok, here we go: I’m a guy who’s as a team leader and **project manager** (some projects), my team was formed by two women and me last year, and both of them became, eventually, friends.

Becoming friends made it difficult when I had to reprimend one or tell them to do their tasks and stop “helping each other” if the “helping” was just enabling bad behavior. Eg, woman A wouldn’t study something because the other one was better at it, even though woman A needed to know it anyway.

Eventually one of them got transferred after she tried to undermine me and get me to lose my position. The other one remained, and I got a new guy as a replacement.

I recently found out, however, that the woman who works with me regularily chats with the other one about me and my “negative sides”.

The one who got transferred, in turn, spills all of this to other people in the company, and it already got to my manager.

For example, during one of this chit chat events, my manager’s secretary (another close friend of the ex-team member, and an ex PM who couldn’t do her job and got demoted) is now suggesting that they tell my coworker to talk to my manager about me because “I’m not in charge and I need to stop treating my team members like interns”

All of this is worrying me because the whole thing is aimed at undermining me, and it’s done by people who aren’t even working with me.

How on earth can I protect myself against this and go to work with complete ease? I can take my team members complaining about me because, well, I’m the boss so that’s to be expected, but I cannot tolerate that every single complian is a tragedy blown out of proportion because it’ll end up costing me my position.

And the woman who’s enabling this is using it to cover her own ass. If I end up as the dictator asshole who wants to boss other people around, her own deficiencies, that actually require being bossed around, can be forgiven...

So, she strikes from afar, saying “see? Not even her current saint of a coworker can tolerate him...”, spin, casually, in the direction of my manager...

——————————

All of this is being framed as me not being able to do my job, and the people doing this have been isolated for their inability to do their jobs (except they were not told specifically that to avoid hurting them):

- First it was about “how I was a good techie but bad at managing people because I had to cut slack to those who *did things differently* (ie, didn’t want to work)”.

- Now it became “he’s too micromanaging and can’t do this with seniors”, or otherwise

- “it’s not his job to check on other people’s work because he isn’t the boss (ie, manager/owner), he asks for X, let the coworker do X and shut up about the rest”.


And I swear to god, if i lose my position because of this, I’m gonna raise so much hell with the owners that these two will either get fired or seriously reprimended... but I don’t want that.

What can I do guys? Any advice on how to stop them from attempting to destroy me like this?",97w0zk,Jeny82,1534452468,29,MensRights,0.0969861,0.02982438,0.007793174

572,"The vestigial mouthpiece that grew out of feminism's left arm and calls itself ""Men's Liberation"", that movement that was intended to help men's issues be resolved and have their rights grow alongside women, continues to have achieved nothing other than gatekeeping against men who would believe equality should not be defined as the advancement of women's ease of living singularly, that mouthpiece has made itself known as basically a male extension of feminism through a recent post.

We got a mention, and it was refreshing to see they didn't bother putting their foot in their mouths by calling r/MensRights a bunch of misogynists or anything. They instead put their foot in their mouths by saying we are wrong to say feminism is bad for men but barely holding up a candle to show us why. I mean, I could've just dropped every case of official feminism and feminist leaders expressing blatant misandry and leading the movement in that direction and breeding tons of prejudice against males...but uhhh...they dropped some of it for me.

I invite you to head over there and read it. Quite a long one to talk in circles about who is an obviously prejudiced shithead and how they aren't obviously prejudiced shitheads. Virtue signaling is quite a sport. No fucking brigading on it, you twats. They gave us plenty of publicity already. Now, here's our little spot in their limelight, I'd rather have you read it yourselves to find the other part about how ""feminism is bad to us but not really let's just shut up and help the women okay"":

""While the MRM is able to call attention to some gender disparities that negatively affect men (suicide, workplace fatalities, lack of concern male rape and abuse victims, etc.), where they falter is who and what they identify as the root cause of these issues and how best to rectify them. The MRM posits that it is feminism, as well as the rights afforded to women through it, that is the reason(s) why men suffer; that gains for women have resulted in losses for men.

Through hatemongering about feminism, co-opting and weaponizing the struggles of vulnerable and marginalized men to silence women, overinflating the frequency of false rape accusations to obfuscate the ubiquity of legitimate cases of rape, and promoting of outdated, inefficient, and destructive traditional models of masculinity and manhood, the Men's Rights Movement--while claiming to be a force for men--is diametrically opposed to MensLib, which sees itself as an ally and compliment to feminism.""

You don't get shit done by being a ""compliment"" to people who oppose your advancement, I really feel bad for them. But we should look at r/MensLib as a perfect example of gynocentrism and how men have been so conditioned to blindly assist and lay themselves down for the females in their society. It's one thing to want your daughter, mother and wife to vote and be able to work for equal wages and generally have civil rights, but to go on accepting a movement that officially stands in front of fathers' rights initiatives and reproductive rights for men, as well as demands full funding for women's DV shelters while leaving the *single* shelter for men in the US to fend for itself, promoting Title IX pretty much as an official feminist tribunal, using hysteria like MeToo to haphazardly provide a feeling of security for female rape victims while generally allowing anything a woman says is rape to be taken for her word, I could go on. But I guess they knew better than to really try to ""call us out"".

HOWEVER, I contend that this should not be the case in marriage. I contend that if a wife is pregnant, whether planned or unplanned, the woman should have zero right to an abortion if the man does not explictely agree. Her right should be the right to give the husband the child and then divorce him if she wants while surrendering her rights and obligations (whatever those may be).

I contend that if a married woman gets an abortion behind her husbands back, this should absolutely be prosecuted as a straight up murder. 

If this were the case, I could see a much stronger case for defending the marriage contract, given that it would provide men with reproductive rights, in exchange for severe economic penalties, which already exist but they'd at least be justified.

580,"Thought: A common argument heard these days is something like ""Women don't have the privilege of being able to safely walk down a dark alley at night or be anywhere alone the way men do.""

Possible rebuttals:

1. That is true, but you are saying that in the context of an example of patriarchy, when in fact this is an example of biology, evolution, and physics, because the only necessary fact in the fact pattern of human male violence is human male physical dominance. In many species the female is far larger than the male, and if one of those species ever evolves the intelligence to articulate its own thoughts and construct dark alleys, then they might say with equal accuracy ""Men don't have the privilege of being able to safely walk down a dark alley at night or be anywhere alone the way women do."" This privilege is determined purely by evolution and physics, and as such is not something you can really throw at the feet of men. This isn't in any way meant to deflect responsibility away from individual males who make the choice to assault someone, sexually or otherwise. Crime ultimately occurs at the level of the individual, which is the opposite of Patriarchy, and the individual still bears full moral responsibility for his actions. It should be noted that one male invention has allowed women thus armed to entirely negate male strength superiority - the hand gun.

2. Men are actually in quite a bit of danger in those dark alley situations, because most male violence is perpetrated upon other males. Most male SEXUAL violence is perpetrated upon females, but is being raped better or worse than being repeatedly stabbed with a knife: a common result of random male on male violence in dark alleys? Think about that blade sliding into you. Is a penis actually worse than that? Think hard. I don't pretend to know ""the answer"", if such a thing exists, but to portray all men as perfectly safe in dark alleys is to lie. Most men are not safe in those spaces, which is why most men avoid them.

589,"The government has decided that giving 400€ a month to any woman that acuse a man of “gender violence” isn’t enough, now they want that judges don’t decide when a woman has been victim of “gender violence”, it would be the regional and town council employees of the feminist “gender equality” bureau who decide.

The measure also states that fathers no longer can ask the judges to stop psychological treatment of the kids (women can take the kids from psychologists to psychologists till they find one that says what they want). The psychologists federation in Spain has stated that the kids could suffer great damaged by receiving treatment for being victims of having a dad that has been violent to their moms when the man could be innocent. The psychologist findings are used in custody battles.

Once a woman acuse a man recibes 400€ a mont an other help in the form of social and psychological benefits for her and the children. Now the woman wouldn’t have to accuse a man, it will only be necessary for women to ask for the subsidies. The bar association explains that men could be accused by the state once a woman has been recognized as a victim of “gender violence” and that the accreditation of being a victim of “gender violence” could be used in custody battles. With this measure only with the word of a town council employee a situation of “gender violence” would be official, the judges would still decide when men are guilty but, paradoxically, the fact that the woman would be a victim of “gender violence” would be official even if a judge decides that the man isn’t guilty. The number of accusations of “gender violence” keeps rising and this is used by the feminist associations to ask for more and more resources to fight it. The number of women killed by domestic violence in Spain was one of the lowest in the world before the law against “gender violence”, after it the number of women murdered by domestic violence has remained stable, around 1.5 per million inhabitants a year.

The bar associations, judges associations and the psychologists associations have protested to no avail.  

The measure is only one of the new measures that the new government want to implement. There is talk about considering “gender violence” a sort of terrorism, and limit freedom of expression in cases of support to say terrorism and considering hate speech  any expression that offends or disrespect victims of “gender violence” in their condition as victims of “gender violence” and therefore a criminal offense. 

The measure will come into effect one week after being approved so, next week. Only possibility to stop it now is to go to the constitutional jury, if it’s passed, it’s a certainty that it will go to the constitutional jury anyway, but what it would say is anyone’s guess.

598,"There are two events from my late childhood and teens that keeps nagging me. They feel wrong and and I get very really upset thinking about them. I'm not sure if my emotions are correct and it feels very frustrating thinking about these. English isn't my first language but I'm hoping you can read  enough to give some advice on how to approach this. Sorry if wrong forum, I think it's relevant because its about how we treat young boys.

Background: My mom was always very comfortable naked at home, a bit too comfortable and I always felt really weird about  that. She would say weird things such as ""never underestimate how nice human touch can be"" and asked me once, ""does your dick get hard when you pee"". As a 10 year old, I was embarrassed and said yes simply because I thought that was a good thing. I also remember sleeping in her in bed  when dad was gone when I was 11, maybe 12. We hugged way too much and spooned all night. In hindsight it feels very wrong because I now feel as if my mom should have known the limits. These events set the ""stage"" for my emotions about event two:

I met my first girlfriend when I was 15 and I eventually asked if we could have a sleep over since we were hanging out 16 hours a day every weekend anyway (other kids did this too).

Two days later, I'm in the car with my mum who says: -Anna (girlfriend's mom) called me and said you had suggested a sleep over... (pause)  She wanted to talk since you two are in an age when things ""happen"" and she want to make sure we (my mum and dad) have talked with you about protection and safe sex. She also told me you have had sex before and isn't a virgin but your girlfriend is""

//At this point I'm cold sweating because of embarrassment and contemplating jumping out of the car//

I say yes I understand and then tell her to not bring it up again. At this point I'm feeling like shit.

In hindsight, what freaks me out is that my girlfriend's mom calls my mom to talk my sexual experience and, that my girlfriend for some reveled such details about me.  The whole conversation sounded like ""we have to protect our daughter from your preditor son"" and again, that a grown women asks if her daughter boyfriend is a virgin. I should add that my dad have always done a great job talking about sex and safety so using protection was never a question. Why was I assumed to no know better?

 I also found out later in our relationship that my girlfriend would often talk about our sex-life with her friends, giving out intimate details about my dick and so on. I'd find this out as her girlfriends would make weird  remarks. 

I felt deeply betrayed and naked because of this and it still makes me very angry.

I  feel as if everyone but me owned my sexuality, secrets, and that I, at any given point could (still can) be talked about without any respect about my privacy. I'ma guy so I should just be ok with it, right?...

I just don't understand why anyone involved, especially the grown women would think that this is ok? It makes me angry and I have a hard time trusting women because of it. I can't blame 15 year old girls but can't help to wonder why it's ok to talk about romantic partners the the most intimate way behind their back. 

Imagine my dad calling her dad talking about my girlfriends sexual experience...

I'm not here to unload my problems on you guys, but I'll tell you that I'm a disabled veteran and may lose what little benefits I receive. This would likely lead to being homeless because I cannot work a regular job, losing medical care, losing custody of my kid, and a subsequently large increase in child support.

​

I believe that this would be an essentially hopeless situation to confront in the US. After falling behind on child support, the state can revoke my driver's license and a recently acquired professional license. Why do they think I'll cough up more money after they cripple my already limited ability to work? I've got no fucking clue my dudes, but that's all possible in my situation.

​

I've decided that *if this becomes my reality*, then I will leave the US and start over in a place that does not enforce US child support orders.

610,"This was a long time ago, but from my experiences practicing family law things haven't changed much.  My mother divorced my father when I was two.  She married my step-father when I was four.  He wasn't really all that much of a step-father.  OK, he was an alcoholic abusive piece of shit who used to make me pack my clothes into a paper bag and then take me out and leave me alone on the side of the road to ""find a new family"" whenever I angered him.  By doing such things as not eating all my dinner.  When I was four.  Big fucking surprise I still have eating issues.  Not a snowball's chance in hell I will ever be overweight.  

So then I was five.  My mom woke up me and my older sister early.  She curled our hair and put us into nice dresses and into the car.  She and my step-father kept saying, ""You better be good.  You better be good.  You better be good now.""  I had no idea where we were going.  

I still used to sometimes see my father then.  I hold onto my meager memories.  He had my eyes and he had my hair and he had a little red sports car and he would pick me and my sister up and take us to the movies.  I still have quite an attraction to men with green eyes and dark hair and little red sports cars.  

So we got to the courthouse and met a man that I now know was a lawyer.  There was a hearing and the judge said that he wanted to talk to the children.  In no time at all I found myself alone with the judge sitting on his lap back in chambers.  Again, I had no idea why I was there or what we were doing.  I only knew that I had to be good.

The judge had jellybeans.  Jellybeans!!!  Wow!  We were making light conversation and I thought things were going good.  Then the judge asked the question that destroyed my entire world.  ""Do you want to live with your mommy or your daddy""?  I froze.  I couldn't cry because I had to be good.  All of a sudden I was terrified.  I almost hardly never saw daddy.  I couldn't lose mommy.  I had to get this question right.  But what about daddy?

I choked out ""mommy"" and he gave me some more jelly beans.  Still seeing both of them was just not presented as an option.  So that is how I got adopted by an abusive alcoholic step-father.  My father was in court to fight it.  Fathers didn't have too many rights when I was five.  I believed for years after that I sold out my father for jelly beans.  Except that I just didn't know him so well.  Not like mommy.

When I was much older, after age eighteen, I tried to find him.  This was not an easy task since mom would not give me any information about him and all I had to go on was my original birth certificate.  I didn't even know what State to start in.  Thousands of dollars to private investigators unfortunately did not produce much.  

I made about five phone calls to possibles with the right name and around the right age.  Just cold calls coming out of nowhere.  My name is Karissa36 and I was born on date in city and State and I am looking for my father.  They all said they weren't my father and I gave up.  

I still wondered if maybe one of them was my father and he just didn't want to see me.  My step-father always told me my father did not want me.  He gave me up so he didn't have to pay child support.  I believed it as children do.  Except getting older I realized that if he didn't want me he would not have been in that courtroom.

I have made my peace with it as much as can be.  Time passes and you can never put your foot in the same river twice.  Still I wonder.  Where is my father?  Do I have more siblings?  Does he ever miss me?  I miss him.

**Girls still choose 'women's jobs'**  
By Will Woodward, education editor

Children believe in equality of the sexes but make decisions about their  
own lives which reinforce stereotypes, according to a study. Around 82% of  
girls and 64% of boys disagreed with the statement that ""a man's job is to  
earn money, a woman's job is to look after the home and family"" in a survey  
for the equal opportunities commission.

The majority of those polled agreed it was ""OK if the father stays at home  
and looks after the children and the mother goes out to work"", although  
working class children were less willing to agree than middle class  
children. Some 87% of girls and 76% of boys believed there was ""no reason  
why men can't be nurses and women can't be airline pilots"".

But the commission said children choose subjects at school and future  
careers on traditional lines. Girls account for 94% of those taking GCSE  
home economics but only 35% of those doing physical education. At A-level,  
only 30% of English students are boys but 78% of physics students are boys.

The EOC today launches What's Stopping You?, a campaign aimed at children  
through youth magazines and schools. It features a picture of a girl's head  
superimposed on the body of Bobby Moore, England's world cup-winning  
football captain.

A total of 89% of health and social care apprentices, 94% of hairdressing  
apprentices, and 86% of primary and nursery teachers are women.

Men take up 99% of construction apprenticeships, 96% of engineering  
apprenticeships and account for 79% of computer analysts and programmers.

Of the 569 11-16 year olds polled by NOP about their future career hopes,  
girls were most likely to choose to become actors, designers, teachers,  
hairdressers and travel industry staff. Boys opted to work in industries  
such as sport, music, graphic design, computing, web design, engineering,  
and the police, fire and armed services.

""Working women are still concentrated in a narrow range of occupations, all  
at the lower paid end of the labour market. We won't get true equality in  
the workplace unless measures are taken at school to encourage young people  
to pick from all the options available,"" the EOC chairwoman, Julie Mellor,  
said.

The education secretary, Estelle Morris, said: ""The EOC's campaign to  
challenge sex stereotyping and widen choices promises to play an important  
part in increasing young people's awareness of the possibilities open to

I recently was discussing with a Jewish friend why I am avidly against having any of my future children circumcised.

I also brought up that I believe it is on par with removing a womans clitoris (something he agreed wasn't right) but he said that I am disrespecting his religion by comparing the two. I tried to bring up data I've read but everything came back to religion which I can't exactly refute. So, I was hoping for a little help and understanding.

623,"Men have been taking up about 95% of those perpetrating murder for the past few years, recently falling down to 88%. When they murder, victims are around a 70% chance to be other men. While male-as-perpetrator stats have fallen, obviously women's stats have risen. It should be noted, though, that women account for almost the entirety of attempted and successful killing of their own offspring, (do not include the reproductive right of abortion here, it is legally recognized and I am a supporter) and have laws in various countries to *lessen their sentences for killing their children based on circumstances*. Their second choice of victim after children is men. If you want to call all men violent nutjobs, why can we not say such things about women with equal callousness?

So why this huge outrage when a man kills a woman? Could it be like when some racists see black-on-black crime all they can imagine is a problem solving itself? So therefore when a white is killed by a person of color, or vice-versa, it usually makes headlines. However, we don't see the same happen when a woman kills a man. We're all very well aware of why. Racism and sexism are a big problem in this country. We all know what races are suffering what, but we as a nation are very, very bad at recognizing the troubles of the half of the population almost solely responsible for protecting the country, providing for it, keeping its infrastructure up, and repairing all things that need repairing. Instead we blame that half for everything and ignore where they are exceedingly important to human civilization's survival and advancement as we know it.

Obviously, truth in pursuit of equality is what we strive for here, so it's important to recognize that men do make up the majority of rape and murder perpetrators *and* victims (include prison rapes and statutory or, and it is very simple to just theorize off the bat that if women were biologically as physically powerful as men things might be more even across the board.

But that seems to be the selling point of this whole ""men are cruel by having penises, women are victims by having vaginas"" garbage. Gynocentrism. You can see it in the highjacking of well-intentioned affirmative action giving women all funding for domestic violence shelters, with zero for men's, these increasingly comfortable living spaces in women's prisons while men's prisons are experiencing a *hunger strike* to protest privatized slave labor and rape rates, recent U.K. laws recognizing women as a *decriminalized gender*, women's supremacy in family courts as well as in any accusation laid against a man versus a man against a woman or even white against black, but before I create a four-paragraph list of where feminists have privileged women to go on domineering with cruel smugness, I have to run things back a bit.

""Women's supremacy"", that thing that was missing from the dismantled chivalrous patriarchal society before the 1970s began to die. In the old model of gynocentrism we had men on top with women both caged and coddled underneath, men did everything and got everything.

Now women are doing some things...but working their way into getting everything. We've cast down patriarchy but here we are with murder rates like never before and gynocentrism still puppeteering that old patriarchal chivalry's corpse to get all the affirmative action and comforting legal and social norms a feminist can command.

Women aren't victims, they're people. Men aren't murderers, they're people. We're not going to get that through to people until they learn of the old term called ""gynocentrism"" and how it runs damn near the entire animal kingdom. If it is not realized I'm afraid we may be seeing actual feminazis with actual brutal power and actual feminazi policies in the future of the US.",9a12fe,GreyTortoise,1535143833,6,MensRights,0.20572066,0.060752302,0.13717735
624,"Just a question I wanted to ask everyone here, especially those who have been here for a long time. Do you believe that men's issues have gained ground, or has the feminist movement become more overwhelming than ever? 

My thoughts on this are a bit mixed. On one hand, there is greater acknowledgement that we have serious problems facing boys and young men today. Suicide, drug abuse, depression, parental alienation... I've been hearing more and more about this in the media today. I will confess that it's mostly conservatives talking about this, however. While a significant amount is indeed ""Grow up, snowflakes!"" or ""They're just a bunch of man-children refusing to grow up!"", others see this as a serious issue that we need to do something about. 

At the same time, female teachers who sleep with their students or alleged predators like Asia Argento are receiving more attention than they have in the past. Female predators have always existed, just as male ones have. I certainly see plenty of comments claiming ""Damn, luckiest man in the world!"" or ""Wish I was that guy!"", there are more men and women calling out the double standard the country has. With female teachers, they're beginning to receive some real prison time. Contrast that with Debra Lafave in 2005, who received no prison time at all. 

Unfortunately, while fewer call themselves feminists, those who do have become more radical. Forty years ago, things like rape culture and the belief that men are all abusers and conspire to brutalize women was generally considered radical feminism; now this is much more mainstream. The new radicals are the ones calling for culling the male species. Most feminists I've encountered personally believe in rape culture, patriarchy, refuse to believe female predators exist, the standard talking points veterans here have encountered many times. 

So I'd like to hear people's thoughts on this. ",9a1g3t,Philip8000,1535146656,25,MensRights,0.13561769,0.039737478,0.027688526

Modern feminism will eventually fail, or at least change into something more resembling genuine egalitarianism.  It may take 50+ years, though.  



The archetype of offended victim will remain, however, and be rebranded with a new inane cause.  

Feminism is a symptom.

Victim culture is the illness.


This archetype will remain as a pattern in society, unless we get rid of victim culture through a period of enlightenment.

Sadly, I don’t think we will ever accomplish this without some catastrophic event that permanently alters our species.  

The best we can hope for is to peacefully delegitimize victim culture as much as possible, **for self-righteous “victims” across the whole political spectrum**  (as it should be)

630,"I have written some 'vignettes' about Saturday's March for Men in Melbourne. I posted in a comment thread, but I have been asked to post them as a new thread. So here you go! 

We (my girlfriend and I ) walked past the protestors who were chanting nursery rhymes. One of them tried to pass me a leaflet. It read “Join the War Against Misogyny!”. I scoffed.

We approached the open air site for the event, and encountered row upon row of police officers standing around casually. We presented ourselves for a security search, and the police office declined. “Am I not bad enough to be searched?” I asked. He laughed. “It is a random search” he lied, unconvincingly.

We entered the space assigned for the speeches. The sun was intense, a welcome relief from the winter months, soon to end. ""Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces. Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here. Here comes the sun!""

The main stage was to my left, and many people were wearing white T-shirts, sold to raise funds for ‘Dads in Distress’. It was clear that the police had located the protestors away from the site of the rally, and created a cordon to protect the people attending the rally. 

The criteria for frisking people entering the rally seemed to be ‘no hair or pink hair’. Skinheads or feminists.  

A lone protestor held a sign they had created from a piece of cardboard. It suggested that I am a misogynist, racist and asshole. I took a photograph, safe in the knowledge that I was not stealing their soul, as they had no soul to lose.

The event began with the Australian National Anthem. My partner was born in Australia, and I was not, but we are both Australians. I am aware of the politicisation of national anthems, and the behaviour of Kaepernick. I felt uncomfortable. It shouldn’t be a political act, but it is.

The speeches began, and were the low point of the rally. The amplification was inadequate, and the speakers held the microphone away from their mouths. The speeches were too long, and delivered in written English. I could make out sound bites every now and again.

The protestors left their holding point, perhaps 100 metres away from the rally, and approached the police cordon, singing nursery rhymes. An infiltrator let off a horn, and then another. They were escorted away very quickly.

The speeches continued, a low hum against the backdrop of the nursery rhymes. One speech went on and on and on. The sun blazed down on my skin. I had forgotten to put on sun protection. It is still winter, after all. Applause interrupted my thoughts. The speech had finally ended

The media were present, and many, many police. You can see that from my photographs. Suddenly, a horn sounded, loud and intrusive. It had been hidden in an Esky (a cooler box) located on top of a roof. The media duly reported on it in their bulletins. A brave soul used his tripod to nudge it off the roof, where a police officer stamped upon it, silencing the searing noise.

The police ushered the nursery rhyme chanters away. By this stage I had two flags bearing the logo of March for Men. With many others, we hung over the balcony overlooking the protestors and waved our flags at them. They reciprocated with more chants, and by raising their middle finger. For many, this will have been their most articulate act of the day.

The speeches went on, snatches intelligible. Eventually, we were told that the speaker I wanted to hear (Rob Tiller) was next, but that he had to be quick as the previous speakers had…well, the police wanted the march to begin soon. He held the microphone close to his mouth, and spoke in spoken English. A blessed relief. I could hear every word!

In an instant, we were told to start the march. We walked in procession with men and women, boys and girls, black and white, Caucasian and Westerners all united in supporting men and masculinity. 

The march led us away from the chanting, down a boulevard (St Kilda Road) bathed in sunshine. Then, a short speech from Sydney Watson, and that was it. The marchers dissipated, like clouds dissolved by the warm afternoon sunshine

I had attended the inaugural meeting of Men's Rights Melbourne, an event so secret that we had to identify ourselves by congregating around a Rubik’ Cube. So I am not exactly new to the men’s rights movement. 

But I had not previously encountered so many gender bigots located in one place at one time. I was disconcerted by the vituperative hatred on show, the indifference to others, and their toxic behaviour. But that’s enough about the protestors. Let’s celebrate that so many of us stood proud, the sun kissed our endeavours, and the police protected up against the scourge of hate-filled fascists.",9ai8y7,actingverystrangely,1535311827,23,MensRights,0.11150667,0.04442204,0.012803185
631,"Like other people in my nation and unlike people from the U.S., I do not consider age of consent to be a hard line drawn in the sand but rather a  very context reliant scenario.

For example, here, if a woman has a child at say, 15 years of age, she is then automatically conferred full adult status and she is therefore completely ""legal"" for any man of any age that she agrees to have sex with. This is part of how the law operates in my nation, in part because a woman requires adult rights to care for a child to begin with, but also because giving birth to a child is considered to be a direct rite of passage from teenager status to adult status.

That being said, I think we can all agree that ""child pornography""  (I.e. 13 and below being used by adults for profit, is what I am referring to) is 100% unacceptable and it is something that must be aggressively investigated at all times. Yeah?

Okay, what about drawings ? the classic example was a guy, I don't remember where exactly but it doesn't matter, that got in trouble for having loli hentai on his laptop. I strongly, STRONGLY disagree with this in the most clear and unambiguous way. I am very much against a guy being charged and possibly convicted with a crime for having ""the wrong drawings"" in his possession.

But I understand that other people do not agree. I know that I am a classical liberal in a subreddit that has a ton of socialists/communists, so I stand alone, but I am still interested in knowing where people fall on this.

**It is my contention that men must have the right to full liberty of expression, and this includes drawing, or having drawings of, the most fucked up things imaginable whether I personally like/dislike them or not**.... simply because drawings are not real, they're purely imagination. Drawings hurt no one and therefore I must be opposed to any subjugation people suffer because of it.

My major (and entire school, really), is very entrenched in feminism, the sociology department so much so that it's like a knee-jerk argument for any topical discussion. I desperately wish I could discuss men's issues in my classes, but I don't think it's even possible.

Women outnumber men pretty heavily in my major. One of my classes this semester has a ratio of 14 women to 3 men. I was always led to believe there were more women because women were being steered into social sciences, but a discussion in that class made me something else going on. A few students and the instructor spent several minutes tearing into the engineering major for having a too masculine environment, for not being social enough and being too emotionless. The rest of the argument was basically petty jabbing.

Now it's very clear: the social sciences have created an environment that is pretty inhospitable to men. There's plenty of instruction geared toward being pleasant and cooperative, and none toward directly tackling issues. Male students and professors are also expected to regard themselves as the origin of feminist problems, and if they have any issues, they absolutely cannot bring them up. I've noticed a lot of the few men in my classes won't speak up in class, but of course I can't know exactly why with out asking...

Men studying/who have studied in social science fields... have you ever been discriminated against against because of your sex? Did you go through with the studies or change fields? What can/should students do to bring men's issues to the forefront in social science departments and colleges on the whole?",9bbbvb,Obgrpy,1535563546,42,MensRights,0.16245349,0.061101943,0.010032792
647,"#Education
Very intelligent men are correctly perceiving it as a huge risk to work with children, because of the absurd narrative of the media that men are dangerously prone to child abuse. They are thus avoiding the profession in droves, leaving less competent people to teach our children.
## How it Backfired: Young girls (and boys) who are not homeschooled are certain to get a worse education.

#Workplace
The workplace used to be a reasonable place to meet women. Now it's totally reasonable to expect a backlash from HR up to and including being fired for touching, talking to, or, yes, even looking at, women. The net result of this is that women are now a major liability - all your best programmers, engineers and executives are men, and any one of them can be permanently disabled by any female. 
## How It Backfired: Now, you are just well-advised not to hire any women at all. Just don't take the risk. If your country mandates a maximum size where you still get to run your business like you want, don't exceed that size. It's not sexism, it's risk management. As a professional computer programmer, there is no doubt in my mind that, at this point, the worst thing you can do to any of your teams is to introduce a woman into them. Not only do you risk your best programmers being checked by sexual harassment accusations, they will also resent the host of benefits automatically conferred on them. (Having an emotional day? No worries, the deployment can wait!)

#Politics
Having a woman as head of your state used to be a refreshing and novel idea. Now we've seen the shit that has happened in Australia and Kenya. It seems that any women given the authority to do so will instantly seize the opportunity to institutionalize discrimination against males, with utter disregard when it is pointed out that they themselves are sexist.
## How It Backfired: Men who don't feel like having an unfounded allegation of sexual assault heading there way are well-advised to pack their governments and parliaments with as many other men as possible. One exception to this is, interestingly, the judiciary, wherein female judges seem to come down harder on perpetrators of false accusation. The net result is that strongmen politicians are all the more likely to be elected.

#Conclusion
MeToo is fucked up and disadvantages both men and women. It creates social advantages (mostly to be exploited by women). But while sewer moose like Clementine Ford grandstand from their website, actual real women are disadvantaged through poorer education and vastly reduced career opportunities.",9bcq60,smokebowlington,1535573078,3,MensRights,0.20102765,0.10294484,0.010369381
648,"One thing I've noticed is that there is a large amount of trans men(female-&gt;male) when they reach the point that they can pass as men, are suddenly hit with a wave of almost alien social pressures and absolutely no lifeline at all to help them deal with it.

Trans women go from a world where they have a group of friends they can confide in as well as a huge amount of media that addresses these issues they are having along with real role models that they can look up to a ""man's world"" which from the outside looks rather simple. Men don't talk about their problems because quite frankly they can't, there is no media that really addresses male problems or insecurities, and men have so many hobby groups and fandoms that don't really announce what they actually are: coping mechanisms.

In every interview when asked to comment on male culture it is often the same story: ""when I first began my transition I had no idea that the type of world I would be entering. Nobody talks about it so I had no idea that it even existed. It seems like every woman treats me like something she scraped off her shoe and what I thought was anger and overconfidence, upon closer insepection, is actually the result of having to bottle up insecurities. It's no wonder men have so many outlets, there is literally no other way to deal with your problems.""

Though, the ones that are seen in feminist literature tend to be the cases where they have no idea that this is something every man deals with and seem think that it is something exclusive to trans men. Having no emotional lifeline or any men willing to listen and help or connect on any emotional level is just men not accepting them because they are trans.

651,"Yes, it sounds sexist, but I don't really give a f* at this point.

We work on a competitive field, and I've noticed that marernity leave is treated as a ""get out of work for a few months"" jolly card and many of these women come back after 5 or 6 months and expect to have their careers untouched. I'm not talking about being able to have paternity leave (which men have), I'm talking about the indifference to men when it comes to career responsibility: women can drop everything and disappear untouched. Men don't.

In my experience, men cannot just take 1 or 2 months of holidays and expect nothing's going to change for them at the job. Don't get me wrong, I know having children isn't holidays, but it's still a choice, just as would be going on vacation.

What's even worse: if I want a vacation, I have to schedule it and it needs to be approved. If a woman gets pregnant, she's (and rightfully so) under no obligation to schedule it or getting it approved, she would just one day drop into the office and announce it, and everything and everyone will have to re-shift priorities for her.

Equality is equality. We deserved to be treated the same way, not be expected to carry the company's weight while women keep going in and out for this issue. We had 6 different women disappearing in the last 2 years and it's been hell. I almost couldn't even go in vacation to cover for shifts, and I'm not the only one. How is this fair?

What I'm trying to say is, while I'm all for giving women the current set of rights they have in regards to having children, shouldn't the companies give men some sort of similar treatment or benefits that would reward them if they *don't* want to have children but still want something else from life?

But hey, try telling a woman who went on maternity leave for 5 months that she no longer holds the same position in the company and it's hell... sexist, misogynist and unfair. Sure, like the guy who had to cover for her, who now has to step back or get fired, so that mommy can get back on that horse!

This isn't the middle ages: women can *decide* to have children, and they have to *choose* to give stuff up, just like I would have to give stuff up if I *decided* to go on a 3 months cruise. But no, it's treated as an untouchable right of the human being. Besides, who cares, there's always some men around to do the work for them while they are away, right?

And don't even question it, otherwise you are a misogynistic prick... Equality is equality. You wanted the same rights, so deal with it: if you choose to disappear to have children, then you also choose to let your career go for that time, and don't expect to be treated like it never happened when you come back!

656,"The law differs from nation to nation, we know this to be true. In my nation (Mexico), consent as a concept, applies only when it comes to determinations of underage sexual intercourse.

Such a thing is highly context dependent.... the example I often use is that if a woman gives birth to a child at 15 years of age, she is automatically conferred full adult status and rights.

Anyway, in the U.S. and other first-world nations, there is the idea that ""concent"" is some sort of ""acceptance"" of sexual intercourse. I find such a notion to be laughable,  but I understand others do not agree.

I strongly believe that a person's behavior is far more indicative of a situation than a person's words. I.e. if a woman is out boozing with a man at 2 AM and goes back to his place, she is not going there to pray the rosary. Obviously.

""Consent"" as it were, is implied. And if she is there, she takes off her clothes, gets into bed with him, all of that indicates that she is where she wants to be, doing what she wants to do even if she does not say so.

Now, if she suddenly says ""no"" and chooses to leave, it is the law that a man must allow her to exit without obstruction. At the point where obstruction is performed, that is an exercise of force and soon to be followed by violence, depending on the context.

However, if a woman has zero obstructions to just leaving, and instead chooses to stay and have sex with the man. Then there is zero possibility of a ""rape"" having occurred.

This is how we handle it here.

662,"Advice please. 

I'm desperately trying to hold things together for my family in our mortgaged home. We stand to be ruined. I am the Regional Manager of three branches, so I am the perceived alpha, and as a straight white male, I have no class-based victimhood that gives the identity-politics sorts on my staff any reason to empathise with me. Nevermind the personal adversity I endured and overcame, from relative-poverty and considerable abuse growing up, to pulling my finger out and battling through the education and experience that got me here. That's individualist talk, and collectivists don't care. I am just privileged and I don't even know it. 

So, I have about ten years in management roles, and I've noticed that as mainstream media increasingly questions the Patriarchy and writes about how to reduce toxic masculinity and micro-aggressions and mansplaining, etc, the number increases of mainly female staff who think it is acceptable just to say they're not comfortable talking to me so as to not have to have a conversation about improving their performance.

I start with gentle comments, etc, but if a problem persists, I try to sit down with the person to see if we can work things out informally (listening to them as well, etc). Most people can go this far, especially men (just saying). But a few people just walk off while saying, ""Look, I'm not prepared to talk about this because I'm not comfortable"" as if that's some sort of legal escape clause.

Now, I want to emphasise I've been doing this for years and I have management training, so I don't need general tips on how to motivate staff or on how to follow procedures on what to do next (touched on further down, anyway). Anything you can say about this is just likely the steps I follow or consider without going into them here. My specific problem is I believe I am seen as the identity-class bully (the Patriarchy), even though I was always the last person ever to bully anyone (often defending victims and mediating with bullies), and what it means is I'm the one who's really being bullied. I'm even having nightmares, it's that bad. 

Let me continue: It's anyway something like 99% soft skills, this leading people business. Encouraging, facilitating, empowering - all that. However, if someone's really going too far, then according to imployment guidelines in my area (New Zealand), staff don't actually have a right not to be uncomfortable with a manager if it concerns legitimate work. (We're not talking about sexual harassment or religious discrimination, etc.) We do need to take reasonable care, though, to ensure they are not made to feel ""unduly uncomfortable."" However, it's not like it won't take eons to get them to understand the intracacies around all of this, to the point it's hardly worth trying. 

So, one lady went into a rage with me because I wanted to resolve an ambiguity and misunderstanding around her attending meetings. I'd given her the choice of talking about it now or in the next few days, but insisted we needed to talk it through, so she chose now and flew off her handle without giving me a chance. Perhaps out of an interest in self-preservation, she then filed a complaint that I had bullied her. I am a senior manager, but only of my region. There are ""more senior"" managers within the company. They didn't care that in NZ, workplace bullying is defined as, among other things, ""not a one of instance, such as an argument"", and ""not your manager wanting to talk to you about your performance"". It just went on my record as a bullying accusation, which was investigated accordingly. She later ""moderated"" that side of her statement, but the fallout meant my mandate to lead was reduced rather than reinforced.

Recently, another woman was on the warpath, saying things around the office such as: ""None of you need to attend staff meetings. Don't accept management's offer of a $50 petrol reimbursement. If you increase my output from six units to seven (others average 12 and go up to 16), I will go home and set my [employment] contract on fire."" I needed to talk to her. I offered twice. She declined. I sent an assistant manager to talk to her, and he kept a record she was agreeable and promised to change. She didn't. I invited her to a formal talk with a support person. She declined, and told me to do some more shopping for her work resources. I sent another formal invitation with the caution that if she declined again, she would receive a formal warning. She wrote to my assistant manager that she thought she might resign. He advised her not to and asked her to attend - he would be there too. She showed up, said her piece, and threw over a typed and signed resignation. I later accepted it. My assistant manager wrote to endorse our processes and how fair and calm I had been. (He's gay, so not everyone is against me as a straight white male - only the far-left, collectivist, neo-Marxists.) 

The CEO and his deputy have given me absolute hell, despite all the documentation I maintained to show how unreasonable she had been and how I had followed employment guidelines at every step, as well as my management team endorsing me 100%. The upshot is I have been forced to sign a document saying staff don't need to talk to me if they're simply uncomfortable. That's a complete denial of probably the most fundamental right of a manager. If your staff won't talk to you, they're not working with you. Employment guidelines state that the most common form of the bullying of a manager (since it can go both ways), is refusing to cooperate and communicate. And yet this is now enabled by the CEO. It is bullying by proxy. The deputy told this woman in front of me saying if she would rescind her resignation, she would no longer need to report to me. I emailed my concerns that this would be an emotionally abusive act and my and my assistant managers' psychological wellbeing was also at stake. 

I have three staff in particular who are volatile (aside from the one who went into a rage, accused me of bullying, but tries to be nice to me now). One guy, who other managers warn is manipulative and feuds, keeps writing complaints about my character to the CEO after I stopped pandering to him. One woman who is old enough to retire occasionally flies off onto a rage, throwing things and swearing her head off (not at me - it's not all at me - but I anticipate it can happen at any time). Another lady cannot look at men without thinking there is something sexual going on. Both my assistant managers have noticed it, even my gay manager, and both have expressed how this concerns them. One male staff member, I am fairly sure, resigned to get away from her and the risk of accusations she represents (the rumours about something between them had become rife). She even wanted a customer removed from her account because he had cried once (he is a refugee from Palistine) and another time his sister had smiled at him and then he had smiled at this woman, so she thinks he's in love with her. 

These are three very concerning people, and I am now powerless to hold them increasingly to account unless they agree to say they're comfortable at every step - a feuder, a woman who rages, and a woman who sees men as sexual predators. Many of these issues are inherited, as I only came in 10 months ago, and I was warned about each of these individuals. I hold a lot of responsibilities and accordingly I am accountable, even to the law in extreme cases. But I have been denied commensurate authority to lead. 

I believe it is because of an increasing trend where too many people think their right not to be abused includes not being uncomfortable when discussing their performance or attitude at work with their boss. 

Of course I'm wondering about resigning or hiring a lawyer. (NZ legal proceedings are expensive, and there is no hope of a huge payout, all you tend to get is a little more job security.)

664,"TLDR: Broke up with a girl two months ago, she most likely regrets consensual sexual acts, so she told shared friends I was abusive.

In January I started dating this girl who is in my band section. As such, we spent tons of time together at practice and such, and we have many mutual friends. It was great - until I found about her alcohol and drug abuse. 

She never did it around me, but I had caught her several times. She would lie about her activities, but since she had promised some she wouldn’t do it anymore, I decided to trust her. I also always did my best to support her, even though she never wanted to do anything at all except just take naps and cuddle, which would usually just lead to dumb stuff - handjobs were the furthest we ever went sexually. 

I always made sure that she was comfortable. Before we ever engaged in that kind of activity I told her the following words, verbatim:

“I always want to make sure that you’re comfortable. If we’re doing something and you don’t like it, or you’re not in the mood; whatever the case may be, I want you to tell me. I never want to make you feel like that and it’s better for you to just ask me to stop then worry about it later”.

She agreed. Only one time she asked me to not go down on her, and I agreed. I didn’t do it again. On several other occasions I would go to finger her and she would say she was ovulating, so I would stop. I always respected her space.

I broke up with her two months ago. Tonight we had the annual sectional lake trip, and everyone was invited, including her. I figured it would be fine because she’s already started dating someone else, but she’s been distant from the whole group. Additionally, last night she told about half the people in the section that I was a bad boyfriend who was “abusive”. 

I know this because a good friend of mine who was up there when she was talking about it told me this morning. According to him, she didn’t want to go into detail, and left it ambiguous and up to interpretation. 

I know 100% that I never emotionally or physically abused her. However, I do believe that she regrets some of her choices in our relationship and to cope with her regret has taken a stance of victimhood.

Band is important to me. I’m a section leader and I still have another year left in the program. But this girl, my ex and co section leader, is trying to ruin my reputation and divide the section.

666,"So this happened last night. We were camping in a caravan somewhere in Spain. 
Wife and I have a few beers while the kids show is on. We go back to our caravan at around 2300, I immediately go to sleep and my son jumps into my bed. We fall asleep, and at 0100 I hear noises. Look out the window and see my wife with the neighbor woman in my porch drinking wine. I wouldn't give a s#&amp;@, except for the fact that my 5 year old daughter is outside playing instead of sleeping as she should. Go back to sleep, at 0230 the light goes on in the caravan. Wife is completely drunk and making noises, daughter is awake and with her. Wife managed to drink 3 bottles of wine with the neighbor.  I get angry, have an argument with her and decide to pack my stuff and leave. While packing the car, my wife comes out screaming, she is so drunk that she trips and falls flat to the ground. She starts screaming like a beast, a few neighbors come out. My kids are crying and I have to go back on the  caravan to calm them, while the neighbors take care of my wife who is  laying on the ground crying and screaming. 15 mins later an ambulance and 2 police patrols show up. One patrol is 2 women specialized in violence against women. I get questioned several times, by default I am guilty of hitting the wife. The police women don't believe me and tell me I must have done something to her. For some weird miracle the security guy was patroling the area, and saw my wife trip and fall to the ground. If it wasn't for his testimony, I would be in jail right now. 
The more senior cop interrogates him and me. He sees the empty wine bottles, and tells me even though he believes me, my wife could press charges and I would give straight to jail. The problem is that I have 2 young kids in the caravan that I must take care of, so the cops save my ID and tell me I might get a call tomorrow. I ask the ambulance doctor where are they taking my wife. He tells me she is just pretending, that they will x-ray her and dismiss her in less than an hour. They take her to hospital, and in less than 1 hour she is back in the caravan. 
This morning we all wake up, however she is too tired to fix breakfast for the kids and continues sleeping. I take the kids to the pool, come back at 1100  and she is still sleeping. I pack my stuff and leave. She now has my car, my caravan, and will go back to my house next week.  Since she has been unemployed for the past 2 years, I am paying for the house mortgage and private school  by myself. I am now in a cheap hostel thinking what to do with my life. Since I now have a police record, I  am  considering moving to another country...

668,"I'll jump right into it. A close friend of mine was contacted this morning by his ex-girlfriend. She told him she is considering slapping him with a metoo. They dated for years in highschool and broke up shortly after my friend graduated. There's a 3 year age difference so she wants to get him with statutory rape since they were still together when he was 18. If she does and it goes through, my friend could apparently face severe penalty and have to become a registered sex offender, although, since they were both under the legal age of consent, they both would have to become registered sex offenders as far as I know. I think that title alone would scare her enough to back down from such a selfish accusation. 

She called him a predator and says she needs years of therapy. To me, this seems like the work of the metoo mindset feminism has been promoting. It's been about 4 years since they were really in contact with each other at all. Of course I am biased when I say I believe my friend that he never did anything without consent. He's a self proclaimed feminst and feels strongly about their ideals. That's why this is all so bizarre to me. She is clearly caught up in extreme feminism and refuses to think about what she's doing. She said she wants to see my friend's name on ""that list."" I'm not sure if she's just talking about registered sex offenders and I'm not sure why it matters so much to her now. The only thing I could think of is pressure from feminists. 

I'm looking for more advice. We don't really have any money to spare so I'm worried about considering a defense attorney but if she wants to go through with it I don't see any other way.

670,"I go to a charter school with feminist administrators, and oh my gosh. It's been an incredible ride since 8th grade. I'm currently a sophomore. 

It's 5th grade through 12th. Middle school on one side of the street, high school on the other side. I started out in 8th grade, switched schools because I was bullied like crazy. 

In freshman year, we have to take this class called cultural sensitivity. This basically caters to the administration and groups that are funding the school. I'm a very controversial person, and I thought I could hold my own, so I decided to take advanced cultural sensitivity. 

The difference between the normal cultural sensitivity class and the advanced one, is that people actually cared about the issues and it was much more discussion and essay based. In the normal one, people were just fulfilling a class requirement. 

Some of the topics we covered were sexism, racism, religious hatred, ""diversity"", oppression, feminism, black lives matter, stereotypes, generalizations, mental health, ethnicity, implicit bias, and the political compass. 

We did 3 big projects throughout the year. Each involved an essay portion, and oral presentation portion with Q/A. 

My first project was ""Identify an example of oppression. Evaluate it from the perspective of cause, effect, and solution"" 

For that first project, I chose the war on boys. This already ticked off the hardcore, dyed hair feminist teacher, just the selection of the topic. I did a 5 page essay on it, 15 slide PowerPoint, and I cited my sources (many didn't at all, many straight plagiarized)

We get our essays back before our powerpoints. I see mine covered in red pen ink, and I immediately go to thinking about grammatical errors. Nope. Teacher was saying stuff about men being oppressors, not the oppressed. I got a 70%, and under the 70 she wrote ""X's next to off topic ideas"". She put X's on my evaluation of male suicide statistics vs females, on my mentions of the elimination of rougher sports from high school gym, all of that. Little red X's. 

I didn't edit, I was fine with the 70 and I knew I was right. I go and give my presentation. Teacher struggles to keep the class of rabid SJWs under control but interrupts me in the same way they were. At the Q/A part at the end, I get verbally jumped by most of the class excluding my friend whos holding back laughs. 

I get my presentation report back a week later. For overall, she said ""Good presentation skills and format, though many off topic and insensitive comments made. 75%""  

For my next two projects, the topics were ""evaluate a sterotype""  and ""Choose a type of discrimination. Research the historical element and compare history to the present"" 

I do the ""African Americans can't swim"" stereotype and my discrimination type was sexism. 

I reference a study that African Americans are 5.5 times more likely to drown according to the CDC and base my first one off that and I talk about pre-1960s sexism, and then  feminism wave by wave until present day for the second project. 

The only one that was taken somewhat well was the African Americans can't swim. I still only got an 80 and had more red ink than anyone else in the class. 

In addition to all that, every class discussion I'd get jumped verbally because I'd do my best to be controversial in their eyes. People even have said ""don't listen to her, she's just wanting a reaction"" which is 150% true, but I'm not using any falsehoods. I'm sourcing everything I say too.

675,"I think there are many solid arguments to be made in favor of making circumscision the focus of the MRM for the time being. It wouldn't drop any of the other issues it focuses on, because they are all absolutely important. But if there's one issue I think would be most beneficial to work on first, it's circumscision. I will be focusing somewhat on the US in this OP.

Most of my reasons are related to the fact that it is an excellent ice breaker. If we can get this issue the attention and action it deserves, it might open more people up when it comes to other issues.

First, there's the obvious double standard. The West has banned FGM, and for good reason. People recognize that FGM is bad. It's a clear comparison that is very hard to twist. Other comparisons, like financial abortions, are more easily warped.

It affects many men, and many women are aware of this issue. This isn't a small percentage of the US. It's an even more common issue than suicide and unfair custody battles. This issue will speak to a lot of people.

It carries extremely powerful emotional wieght. It's very hard to make the mutilation of the genitals of newborn babies sound acceptable. Videos of it are horrific to watch, even when anesthesia is used. There is evidence that it causes measurable, negative, traumatic mental changes.

Some will argue that it's a religious issue and that will make it hard to fight against. However, the West has never been more secular, and many are willing to put personal rights ahead of religious rights today.

Claims that circumscision doesn't hurt the child can be easily fought with studies and doctor testimony. I need to look into these more myself, however there seems to be enough evidence out there to disprove this idea.

Feminists will argue that FGM is much more severe. However, as there are many forms of FGM and MGM, including various levels of severity of circumscision, this argument is relatively easy to dismiss. Furthermore, while this can be true in certain cases, FGM is nearly non-existent in the the West. As such, you can make the argument that in the West MGM is much more severe of a problem than FGM.

I do not think we should phrase any arguments in terms of how this issue effects women, aside from talking about testimony from mothers of sons who underwent the procedure. While these this may effect women in the bedroom, I do not want to give feminists an inch and have them take a mile and hijack this issue for themselves. I do not want the narrative to be twisted to make men as a whole look like that bad guys on their own issue once again. That being said, we shouldn't shy away from criticising anyone, male or female, who supports this cruel practice.


TL;DR: Circumscision would be an excellent ice breaker for getting the world to talk about and work on men's issues. We can work off of existing sentiments about FGM, it's a very well known issue that's present in many lives, and it carries extreme emotional weight. We have strong pathos, egos, and logos arguements, all of which are relatively difficult to effectively attack. Defences against possible arguements are relatively strong, especially coming from non-feminists who are not approaching things through a ""men as oppressors"" lens.",9cwpuo,Red_Raven,1536075355,54,MensRights,0.027324399,0.014390918,0.0077025536
676,"**#Metoo, Argento and a Conflicting Vision of Sexuality** 

**Intro**

I've felt a nagging sensation which has been hard to root out over the past 2 years.  In my view the most human motive is to stand at the precipice of the known and look upon the unknown and to move forward bravely to grapple with the unknown and one day make it ""known"".  We live in a society (American) today which seems ""off"", hence this odd sensation which I've felt lately.  I've paid a great deal of attention to several of the rising New Media personalities including Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Sam Harris and depending on the argument/issue find myself agreeing with their general philosophies for how to think and how to engage in civil, open, dialogue about the unknown.  I can't say I agree with everything they saw, but it is a breath a fresh air in background of the ever-growing dishonesty and doublethink in today's society.

Problems and uncertainty are one of the few constants in life.  How we are allowed to engage problems and uncertainty is also a highly debated issue.  It seems like in today's mainstream society, there is a increasing fragility and negative emotion attached to traditional pillars of society.  I am not arguing that we need to dogmatically uphold traditional values, however there is spectrum of resistance to this which ranges from upholding those values to seeing to how to change them to better conform with society to persecution of those who believe such values.  And indeed, the ""new"" ideas are indeed not new in that they are an innovative hypothesis for how to live society but just the opposite of what is traditionally valued.  I find this perplexing.

I'm not sure if this is related to moral relativism, nihilism, increasing income equality, post-modernism, or just an emotional knee-jerk reaction of the effect that technology has on society which is why I hope this forum will be something from which I can learn from because clearly thinking about myself is not going to be the solution.

Having said all this, the #Metoo movement seems to me to be at the junction of a lot of what has been bothering me and several unresolved issues remain for me which I can't exactly but my finger on.  I will lay out some of thoughts on some of the issues and a framework that I hope others can build on to create a more clear picture of reality.

**Conflicting Visions**

The various forums on reddit including rMGTOW, r/MensRights and r/RedPill seems to be circling a common concept of the changing sexual marketplace for both men and women and its effects on society and individual.  Indeed debate issues on many of the granular issues related to this.  In the setting of this the explosion of #Metoo was fascinating to me, as essentially many of the taboo topics discussed on this reddit forums seemed to either offer explanation or even ring true.

In my view, sexuality is an inherently treacherous field to study, predict or try to experience.  Its humbling, unpredictable and all consuming at the same time.  It holds a prime position is all religions and cultural systems around the world.  Indeed, from an evolutionary perspective it is the purpose of life of biological beings.  I can't say I understand why things are this way, and I probably won't every be able to.  However that in itself creates a decision about what to do moving forward.  Here arises the conflicting vision of sexuality which I believe is at the center of #Metoo.

Vision 1- The acceptance that sexuality is a human need but its true nature is mysterious and sometimes causes grief, jealously, pain and other times causes great elation and indeed sexual energy may drive human society, as it certainly drives other animals.  This mystery and our ignorance to it needs to be respected.  Indeed, the decision then is how to regulate or harness this ""force"" to make society a better place.  I probably lean more towards this vision.  

Vision 2- Sexuality can be conquered.  Sex is a physical act with physical effects.  However, societies have placed undue respect to it due our lack of understanding sex.  But now we do have an understanding of it: Sexuality is a behavior like anything else, i.e eating food. The purpose of sexuality biologically is to procreate and the purpose of eating is too get energy substrate to live.  The tastes and behaviors associated with each act should be have minimal regulation.  Indeed the old pillars (patriarchy) of regulation are outdated and not only rejected but we should the opposite of them in order to ""rebalance"" society.  This rebalancing act will lead us closer to a society which will get the maximum utility out of sexuality.

**Current Situation**

\#Metoo in my view was a ticking time bomb.  Harvey Weinstein was one of many men who exerted his social status/financial power to find ways to have sex with women.  However, society was looking for a story to scream about.  Similar to race riots that happen intermittently in cities- for every Michael Brown there are hundreds of incidents which could easily be substituted, but there is sort of emotional breaking point which sets off a hysteria.  

What made Weinstein's tactics unacceptable was the idea that he forced himself on women who were actually unwilling to have sex with him (rape) and that his social and financial power allowed him to get away with it.  Certainly this is a grim narrative: a rapist who got away with it for years because of power.  I think the Asia Argento saga (suicide of Anthony Bourdain and her statutory rape case) were revealing.  Lots of unstated things happened with the Argento ordeal.  Firstly, was revelation of her character and the obvious supposition that she had a transactional sexual relationship with Weinstein and that she used #Metoo to gain power and attention.   

The fundamental conflict here is that the sexual liberation of women in the 70s (and increasing use of birth control) had a unforetold consequence.  Sex was devalued. No more religious, spiritual reverence for many people.  Women had more agency to wield sex as they saw fit, but then they lived with the consequences.  A women could pursue the pathway of using sex to have a man fall in love with her and maybe start a family or now, could have sex just for pleasure or for other motives.  For feminism, this symbolized a rebalancing, after all, this is what have been able to do for all history.  What is ignored here is that fact that female are generally the ""choosy"" sex in human interactions, and other than rape, men must generally prove themselves ""worthy"" in order to have access to sex.  This narrative is conveniently ignored by modern feminists.  

Indeed, there exists a different narrative with Weinstein affair: that Argento and others likely knew about the transactional nature of Hollywood and used it to get what they wanted: Fame and Power.  Some were undoubtedly duped.  However, most were empowered women who did what they had to to get what they wanted.  Hollywood is not the priesthood (bad analogy in the present, but will have to be discussed more in depth later) and moral are loose but the prize is fame: A Devils Bargain.  I don't think anyone of the right or left will say this is a culture which should be supported, however cultures like Hollywood have always been known and tolerated in societies.  Why was the Weinstein affair a surprise.  It wasn't, is the short answer.

One narrative makes Weinstein the clear villain.  Another makes Weinstein a villain but Argento a villain as well.  Who should we support.  Vision 1 which I wrote about should say that Weinstein and his conquests were just lost in the trials and tribulations of an unfettered sex culture.  And if they are adults then it's own fault for getting into that culture.  If they are not adults who are aware, then their actions should have been regulated (like children at a dance).  The Vision 2 narrative is that Weinstein utilized the old patriarchy techniques in order to get women to sleep with him (by any means, including force).  This cannot be tolerating because it is in direct contract to the rebalancing force which is needed to further society.  The only solution is the neutralization of Weinstein.  What will replace it is yet to be determined in Hollywood culture, so perhaps the only solution is neutralization of Hollywood culture.  However it is exactly the attainment of status within Hollywood which likely drove Argento and others to ""allow"" Weinstein to achieve sexual gratification with them.  Here is where my thoughts and ideas come to a fray.  I don't really know what the Vision 2 narrative's end game is beyond just a everyone for themselves attitude with disregard for all else.

**Moving Forward**

The #Metoo movement continues to evolve and its meaning and purpose seems to mean different things for different people.  Running parallel, the backlash is also evolving.  In some ways the online dialogue offers at times a refreshing discussion of these points.  What I'm interested is really just what the effects are going to be.  

Most likely  nothing will change and society and men who are in Weinstein's position will just be more careful in how they wield their sexual market value power in order to not be consumed in career ending hysteria.  But fundamentally nothing will change for men or women.  This hypothesis is less satisfying more as I feel this is a symptom of a which bigger conflict in the US and indeed the West.  Several logical fallacies of feminism, gender relations and differing views of human nature seem to be juxtaposed together here.

Perhaps there will be different groupings of people/relationships.  Some will live by some rendition of Vision 1 and some will live by Vision 2 or some combinations.  And we will just have to see overtime which leads to more wellbeing.  

Thank you for those who have read to this point.  I hope to evolve my points further on this and other issues.  Your comments, especially critical ones, can only help inform me to gain a clearer picture of reality, which is my ultimate goal.",9cxnx7,skylineeihay,1536081145,1,MensRights,0.18459146,0.03665562,0.012026439

682,"Simply stated, the female victim, male aggressor paradigm not only hurts heterosexual men, it is harmful to the LBGTQ community as well. 

For instance, the argument that female initiated violence is less severe, and therefore less harmful sends the wrong message to same sex female couples. This impacts reporting of violence in addition to seeking help etc.

The impact on same sex male couples is more pronounced. Not only are there barriers to reporting, they are equally impacted by the lack of resources for male victims of domestic violence as their heterosexual counterparts. 

I can’t even begin to think how problematic this world view is for trans ( transitioned or not ) community, not to mention non-binary etc. 

I won’t go into the impacts on heterosexual male populations as I hope were all well versed in that regard.

Essentially, it’s an archaic view on a significant social issue that only serves the needs of heterosexual females while posing problems for everyone else.

Backstory

School started this week, and as I was looking at the schools website reading the parent blogs and news about the new school year. I was looked at the staff directory and noticed that there was no male staff on the faculty.  So I contacted the principle to express concerns about the lack of a positive masculine presence at the School. I included the recent MIT study about female teacher bias against boys, and studies on how the lack of male role models leads to increased negative outcomes for all children. 

To my surprise I got a quick and very positive response from the principle.  She expressed that she shares the same concerns as I do.  That the school is a Montessori program and requires specialized training that is almost completely female dominated, and that in the last 2-3 years only 1 man had applied for a teaching position with the school was hired but left for greener pastures.  I said that I can empathize as I have worked most of my life in a trade and that that industry has had issues attracting females employees. 

This is when she asked for ideas of how to increase the male presence at the school. She wants to keep an open dialog with me and have meetings where we can brainstorm ideas on how to achieve this goal that we both would like to see.

In tennis you are not allowed to receive any coaching during a match. She cried sexism, but this happens to men frequently as well, and she was facing a woman, who was following the rules correctly. 

I also think Ronda Rousey proves without a doubt that there is zero sexism when it comes to what athletes are paid. Dana White, the commissioner of the UFC is imo a misogynistic sexist asshole. He insults women in the league, and says they look like men. He also said for the longest time that women would never fight in the UFC, but changed his mind when he realized the money he would make. Unlike other sports, when an athlete is convicted of domestic violence, there is zero repercussion within the UFC and fighters are generally allowed back in without any hassle. 

Even with Dana's and the UFC's blatant sexism, Ronda Rousey was the highest paid athlete in the UFC, during her title reign. What athletes are paid is directly correlated to their market value. If fans buy paper views when a specific fighter is fighting, that person deserves more money. If you produce more money for your company, you deserve to be compensated higher.

The other one said, ""Keep all the rapists in same room for long time. Some one gets raped in the room &amp; they will understand what someone goes through. The other one said, "" they should be dosed every time with something that will cause penis to erect for hours "". Clearly we were joking.**

**Then adding to jokes, i said "" damm why these rapists are in hurry? Don't they know how to use condom? ""**

I didn't know that two feminists were besides me. They heard it &amp; damm came to harrash me for saying it. They said they were offended and i should say sorry for it. Probably a 3-4 min speech. I clearly didn't give a fuck to them. At the end, i said Go to your table and eat your shit there. I didn't know if they heard the other jokes or not but i guess from their argument they didn't listen.

The story is real

Question:

I am not calling all of feminists bad. I prefer not to use some radical terms associated with feminism too. Most of them are not radical too. I considered that as a toxic form of feminism. Either they just wanted feminism label or were uneducated in feminism.  **So Did i say something bad?

""It's sexism!"" Here's a list of 6 men and 1 woman that this same umpire has penalized.

""It's a double standard when men can get away with it!"" Each umpire behaves differently, and again refer to that guy's record.

""The umpire didn't do his job right."" He penalized her for getting help from her coach, and he didn't let her get away with her tantrum.

My title comes from the #metoo thing. They are bringing accusations of things that happened beyond that time frame and still are trying for convictions. Cosby (even though I think he did it all) if I remember was gone after for stuff that happened well over 20 years ago.

714,"I've been comparing feminist propaganda in the US and Canada with feminist propaganda in my native country of Italy. The former is much louder and brash, bold faced lies or misleading figures are constantly peddled to the public. That's why I would call it high intensity propaganda. In Italy feminist propaganda is more subtle and quiet but I believe it might be more dangerous in the long run. For example they were not able to promote the gender gap idiocy because the backlash from the public was such to discourage them. The metoo movement was also met with reservation and the notion of a rape culture where a serious crime like rape is allegedly normalized would be regarded as ludicrous or dubious at best. On the other hand they have been successful in promoting this preposterous concept of femicide which is nothing else than uxoricide with a more gendered name to stoke the women as victims and men as perpetrators dichotomy. It's rooted in the common idea that women are fragile creatures deserving of special protections from society and despite this country is one of the safest for women (with one of the lowest rate of murder against females), the concept of femicide is becoming widely accepted to the point that I've been reading common people using it unironically.  

That's the reason I believe a low intensity propaganda might actually be more dangerous: repeating a lie constantly over the years to the point of penetrating into the collective consciousness and having people believe it.  It's like the drop that carves into the stone over the millenia without meeting any resistance. Conversely a louder type of propaganda generates strong dissent and resistance from the public preventing disinformations and false statistics to become normalized and accepted.

716,"So a little background. I have a name which the first name can be a male's name, but is like 90% a woman's name and my last name is pretty unique making it impossible to identify what culture I may or may not be from. I also refuse to answer any of those questions which say what race or sex you are when applying for jobs.

I recently applied for a job which I did not get. At the interview I asked the 3 other people applying at the same time and all of them (yes all of them) were Muslim females, if they had any experience at this type of job. All of them said they had no experience. I asked the security guard how many people like me he had seen (those words specifically), he said he was glad to see at least one person like me.

A difficult test was given to us which only me and one of the others completed successfully. I asked the test taker if I did well and she said that it's rare for anyone to even answer all the questions much less get them all right. So I went into the interview confidently.

I did not do as well on the interview as I could've, but I was asked all of 3 questions before the interviewer said I wasn't ""the kind of candidate they're looking for."" With three years in the same line of work I thought I had proven I could do the type of job, but here I was denied

In my rejection e-mail they have affirmed that I'm not the kind of candidate they're looking for.

719,"Since the feminist movements began in 1980, we men have lost our dignity and rights. Women complain that they are ""targeted"" as sexual objects, it is not because they are women, but because they have more sexual parts, and, as different form us men, they are more notable, which doesn't justify sexual abuse, but a woman can acuse a man of sexual abuse just by looking at her, if we look at a woman at somewhere else that is not their face, it could be considered sexual abuse. They also say women are stereotyped to be mothers and stay at home, and even though they say this is unfair, they exploit it to win custody on divorce cases. They say that they should also have the ""right"" to be shirtless around, but they still say we are ""rapists"" if we shortly stare at their body. And what they dont understand, is that we cant be equal in that kind of stuff, we have a different anatomy, which guides to different obligations. Its like we complained about wanting to get pregnant too. Why cant we have equal rights? Why do they have preference in custody, why do they have the privilege of committing crimes and be less judged than men? Why can they hit us, and if we defend ourselves it is considered abuse? It is simply becuase we dont complain. Apart from this subreddit, I have never seen a group of men complain and battle for their rights. We can do it brothers, we are capable of doing it.

When did we stop being men? Why did we stop being men? Why have we allowed things to get to the level we have?

723,"Remember, if you have an ex that you are divorcing or going to court for custody, always use your phone to record all contact you have with her.

My ex got arrested last night and I probably would have been destroyed and lost my daughter if I didn't record it all.  Last year, I filed for custody. Three days later, she decided to call the cops and have me arrested for DV.  No proof, nothing.  It cost me $12k to beat the charge and the new CPT refused to sign my re-enlistment so I ended up having to leave the military and lost my opportunity at OCS (Officer Candidate School) too.

I continued to have issues with her making wild accusations and everyone taking them extremely seriously.  One time they realized she was lying, but it was a different police department than the one she lives at.  I live 2.5 hours away.  My local police realized she lied about being concerned for my 2 year old daughter's safety when they came into the house and saw my daughter giggling with her cousins and running up to me and hugging me when I called her.

Anyways, here is why you always record your contact with your ex:

Last night my ex told me she found a job, she needed me to get our daughter to babysit, since it would take her a few days to get a babysitter lined up.  I refused, but she keep begging and begging me.  So I finally gave in when she agreed to let me take her until Saturday, so I would have an extra night with my daughter.

I suspected about half way to COS that she was lying about the situation, but I was already half way there.  I had hung up on her 3 days earlier when she was asking me questions that I had already answered.  Like, why don't you keep calling me until I answer? I explained I returned her call that that was enough (Multiple calls can lead to harassment charges).  Why won't I marry her?  I said, I don't want to. (You got me arrested on a lie you evil hag) I told her to stop asking questions, she agreed and made a statement about our daughter.  I responded and then she said, ""Why do you hate me so much?  I told her, ""I'm not answering you, I told you to stop this."" I promptly hung up.  For the next 3 days I had constant calls and nasty texts.  I was going to pick up my daughter on Thursday and stop by the police station to see if I could report harassment about her constant calls and messages.

So suspecting she was lying and just wanting me to drive down there, I was worried about this whole situation.  She had agreed to meet me at the police station, but when I was about 2/3s of the way there she called me and told me that I needed to go to her apartment. I refused and argued a bit with her, but she insisted she wasn't dressed for going out and she was just going to bring her out to me at the apartment.  

About 20 minutes away, she called and told me I would have to go into the house and she left the door unlocked.  I wasn't happy, but finally relented.  I pulled up and texted her and of course she didn't come out.  So I went in.  Luckily, I decided to record the entire thing from the exit of the vehicle through the entire conversation.  I literally had the motor running when I started the voice memos and put the phone in my pocket.  I went into the apartment and saw my daughter undressed.  I started to dress my daughter and my ex demanded that I just continue to talk to her and she had the right to talk to me anytime she wanted.  I kept calm and dressed my daughter and when I finished dressing her, I told her I was leaving.  I still was extremely scared and regretting I didn't just refuse to get my daughter when she refused to go to the station.

When I told her I was leaving, she said she deserved 3 minutes to talk to me, since I was getting her an extra night.  I saw how the game was going to go.  I told her she had 3 minutes.  She started talking how someday I would need to talk to her and tell her my thoughts and why I was so difficult with her, blah blah blah.  I told her that was fine, but that wasn't happening that night.  She accused me of being the problem and starting the 3 day fight.  I told her all I did was hang up, when I told her to quit asking questions.  I told her she was the one who was going off for 3 days.  She then started telling me about how she would tell the judge I don't care to talk my daughter.  I said I did, but I didn't want to deal with her after I was done talking to my daughter.

She took a second to clear her thoughts and I used that moment to say that I was leaving.  I started to walk out with my daughter.  She told me, to stop and she just wanted to ask me one more question.  I've seen that game before, so I just kept walking.  She realized I wasn't going to turn around and talk to her like I used to.  So she jumped up and ran after me.  She was yelling that she was going to call the cops I kidnapped her daughter.  As I got into my vehicle I told her to call the cops I had the texts telling me to take our daughter tonight.  I shut the door and locked the doors.  I then proceeded to get my daughter buckled in.  She thought I was going to get out to get into the driver seat, but that wasn't going to happen.  I crawled over seats.  She was telling me she had the right to talk to her daughter.  I rolled the window down an inch and told her to tell her daughter goodbye.  She said she had the right to hug her daughter before she left.  I told her I was not going to do that, because I feared for my safety.  I started the vehicle and she blocked me from leaving.  I told her to get way from the vehicle.  I then called 911.  As soon as I hit dial the recording stopped and she immediately started letting out curses toward me, threatening to destroy me.  She told me when the cops come, she was going to get me arrested.  She was calling me faggot and a pussy and so forth.

The cops showed up and they went to her to ask her what is going on since she was outside and obviously blocking the vehicle.  She told them, ""I'm not talking to you, this is ridiculous!"" (Not the way to win friends and influence people).  When they started to talk to me she immediately wanted to tell them the ""real"" story.

When they finally got to talk to her, she claimed that he told me she didn't want me in the apartment, that I walked in unannounced and unwelcome, that I started to grope and sexually assault her, begging to ""play with her"".  The cops told me that both of us committed a crime, but the evidence was slim on her claims.  I tried to tell them that I had an audio recording of the whole thing.  They just ignored that and said they were going to talk to her to get her to not press charges for the illegal entry (felony) and they would drop her arrest for illegally detaining me (misdemeanor).  When they got back to me, they said she agreed to that, but wanted a police report about the incident so she could present it to the judge that I was dangerous for our daughter.  

Obviously upset, I pleaded with them, I told them, ""Why do you believe her, she lies she is a 2 time felon and had me falsely arrested.  I have a recording, please just listen to the recording and you'll see that I'm being honest.""

They agreed to listen to the 11:45 recording.  Two of the 3 cops placed an earbud into one of their ears and listened.  When it was done, the female cop looked at the other officer and said, ""Wow...We need to talk.""

They talked to the 3rd officer and came back and told me she was being arrested for ""illegally detaining me"".  I hope her probation officer does something and I hope the court reverses the suspended sentence, but with my luck, it won't happen.

The cops apologized and said that they wish it would have registered with them earlier about the audio recording.  They told me they could see how she was definitely trying to burn me and literally nothing she said was true.

I told them I wouldn't take her son, but that I would take my daughter.  I hope they finally take it serious about her abuse.

Anyways, let this be a lesson to everyone.  Always record, even if you think things are going well.  You never know when it will save your ass.  I easily could have gotten a felon charge and she would have had enough ammo to get me to have little to no visitation with my daughter.

I still need to keep and maintain clothes for them, food, beds, books, activities (if/when I choose any additional, formal extracurriculars for them), entertainment, half of the medical expenses, etc. Literally the only thing I won't be paying for is child care. I looked up what I would be paying if it were 50/50 custody and the difference is less than $50.



I really want to go for 50/50 custody, but I'm afraid of spending all the money on court costs when I know a court is more likely to award her greater custody than me simply because I work nights and one of our kids is still breast feeding (1 year old). This is in Iowa. Any advice? Words of encouragement? Anything? I'm actually losing sleep over this.",0.11140333,0.046764325,0.010110466
728,"I just saw a pretty funny pussy pass denied post and man, there were a lot of man hating radical feminists. Getting called the ""trash gender"", ""Woman haters"", your typical ""misogynist"" and more. Basically they think the sub is all about watching woman getting hurt and getting satisfaction out of it, but that isn't true. The sub is about woman getting in the same situations as men and them not being able to use their sex to get out of it.

Honestly looking at the comments of the post tells a lot about radical feminists. Some people think feminism is about equality, but how is being called a misogynist, not getting sympathy when something bad happens to you, radical feminists not caring about your opinion just because you're a man and you're mansplaining help mens issues in any way? It just angers me, not just the feminists in the sub, but this entire planet does. I just don't want this stupid shit anymore. I want everyone to be treated equally. That's really all I want.

729,"Hello /r/MensRights! 

(I am new here, so please forgive me if I make any mistakes.)

I am a student at University, currently doing my Master's (studying Digital Media and Society). One of my assignments involves an ethnographic study, from a qualitative methods approach. 

I am writing this to invite any volunteers for possible interviews later this year (October/November). I'm very interested on writing on the matter of the Red Pill movement and Feminism.

I'd really appreciate any additional comments or volunteers! ",9g13v8,adthea,1537014644,51,MensRights,0.041172907,0.015340924,0.009929225
730,"TLDR; feminists are full of shit.   They don't even believe their own theories and, to the extent that they do, they are fucking morons.  

Back in the 70's a ""political lesbianism"" faction developed in the feminist movement.   Its most notorious advocate was Valerie Solonas, who wrote a manifesto titled ""SCUM"" (Society For Cutting Up Men) and attempted to murder famed pop artist Andy Warhol.   Though the average person might assume that 99 percent of feminists condemned her actions, the truth is that she received widespread support.   In fact the National Organization for Women paid her legal expenses and eventually fissured over the burning question of whether subjecting men and boys to genocide may be taking it a tad too far.  

A more ""realistic"" position was taken by the majority of political lesbians: the genders should be completely segregated.   Men would have only to provide the women with sperm, and the two sexes would go their own way.   The women would create a gentle, peaceful utopian society full of unicorns and rainbows and the men would self-destruct in an orgy of bloodshed and testosterone.   

There was only one problem: the vast majority of women didn't hate men and had no interest in political lesbianism.  

Then a funny thing happened: while sex segregation was thrown by the wayside, *the crazy theories that led to political lesbianism became mainstream*.   This was already happening by the mid 70's, when Betty Friedan started speaking out against Gloria Steinem.   Gender studies was founded by a woman (Sally Miller Gearhart) who recommended reducing males to ten percent of the population.   She also coined the slogan ""the future is female.""  

Intriguingly, both Steinem and Gearthart were funded by the American establishment -- in Steinem's case covertly through the CIA, and in Gearthart's case openly by the Ford Foundation.   I'll leave it up to the reader to determine what the hell the American establishment was doing funding certifiable nut cases who literally wanted to tear human society asunder.  

What sort of theories did political lesbians develop?   They argued that all men oppress all women; that all men receive privilege due to their oppression of women; that we live in a ""patriarchy"" and have done so since time immemorial; that men are violent and women are peaceful; that we live in a ""rape culture"" in which men try to oppress women through sexual violence; that domestic violence is a patriarchal conspiracy against women; that male sexuality is vile; that all men are rapists in waiting; that fathers are harmful; etc. etc.   While some of these theories were present in first wave feminism, political lesbians took the ideas to their logical conclusion.  

Lo and behold, in current year, these theories are not only mainstream but appearing in mainstream newspapers and increasingly being taught to children.   The establishment created a Frankenstein monster.   

Here's the thing though -- political lesbians actually had a solution to these alleged problems that actually made sense: segregate the genders.   If their arguments were actually true, it would in fact be our moral duty to divide men and women as much as possible.  

Think of it this way: feminists claim that one in four women will be raped.   Well, I don't know about you, but if there was some sketchy neighborhood in my city where you had a one in four chance of being mugged I wouldn't go anywhere fucking near it.   

Or take MeToo: if it were true that women are constantly being assaulted in the workplace, the most logical solution would be to create male-only and female-only workplaces.   Schools?  Same deal.   Create male-only and female-only university campuses.   Military?  Again: male-only and female-only squads.   This would reduce the alleged epidemic of male-on-female violence by huge margins.  

Yet feminists, while embracing all the theories of political lesbians, never advocate the one solution that would solve the alleged problem.   

This leads me to conclude a few things: subconsciously at least, feminists are aware that (a) about 95 percent of men are good people who want to help, not harm women (b) their theories are therefore bullshit c) if women did strike out on their own and create a female-only society, it would fail miserably.   Women need men to survive.

736,"I waste too much time here because of my own subset of pathologies. Two things:

One: I'm donating $100 to a men's rights cause for the privilege of the entertainment I've had here. Probably anti-circumcision unless anyone has strong feelings about another cause and wants to make that case. I'm open to suggestions. 

Two: There's a whole good faith end of the feminist conversation, and a good faith end of the MRA conversation, and they have more in common with each other than with the trolls on either side. And it's predicated on the idea that looking for people to blame is a waste of time. 

If you want to be on the better end of the conversation, stop caring about shitting on feminism and look for those of us on both sides who care more about solutions than about shitting on each other. So many of you are so jaded that you don't even realize how much you act exactly like the stereotypical evil feminists you're hating on. Don't make their mistakes! Because whether one ""is"" an MRA or ""is"" a feminist, at the end of the day those jaded people are never going to make a damn difference. They'll be stuck hurling crap at each other online until the sun expands to engulf the planet. 

The rest of us have to get to work. And this has been a pleasant interlude. But I'm going to go back and get reengaged with the pro-male feminist advocacy work that made these issues feel important rather than a chance to wage my intellect against hostile strangers online.
